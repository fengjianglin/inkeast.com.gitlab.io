 <p><strong>Chapter 119 The mysterious little fatty.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0119- The mysterious little fatty</strong></p>
  <p>“Ai, there’s still hope.”</p>
  <p>“Little fellow, you say that little fatty can still be saved?” The old man who was sighing looked at Qing Shui with surprise.</p>
  <p>“Yup, old man, what’s the problem?” Qing Shui, after hearing the voices of discussion, couldn’t help himself and asked the old man.</p>
  <p>“Sigh… ever since little fatty was born, misfortune after misfortune has occurred, striking constantly at our family. When he was three, his mother passed away due to a serious illness. When he was seven, his father was out hunting and got eaten by a huge bear…devoured so cleanly that there weren’t even any bones left behind. After that, it was his eldest brother that brought him up.</p>
  <p>When he was 12, he contracted a weird illness. Whenever the illness surfaced, he would lose his memory and not recognize anyone. Little fatty had inborn divine strength, and only his eldest brother could persuade him. But one time when the illness surfaced, the symptoms worsened, and he accidentally killed his own brother!”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui sighed. The moment he saw the little fatty, he already knew that the fatty was suffering from ‘silent madness’. He would only be lucid some of the time. Once the illness surfaced again, he wouldn’t be able to recognize anyone, and would even strike out at people.</p>
  <p>“This child has a bitter life. We can’t even satisfy his hunger. After he killed his brother, he lost a lot of his weight, and were it not for many people holding him back, he would have committed suicide long ago. Before his brother died, he still fervently called out to not let little fatty die. Little fatty must live on! This was also the only reason why we could convince little fatty not to commit suicide.” The old man spoke bitterly.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui felt pity in his heart when he heard that little fatty lost so much weight because of insufficient food. How fat was this little fatty previously then?</p>
  <p>‘Silent Madness’ could be considered a loss of control over emotions and mental faculties. Qing Shui approached the little fatty as he squat down, and then retrieved a golden needle and inserted it into the Baihui acupoint of little fatty.</p>
  <p>Activating his heavenly vision technique, he saw that there was a soy-bean sized pocket of solid Qi in his channel, obstructing the path of his normal Qi. Whenever the path of Qi was blocked, the ‘Silent Madness’ would activate.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui transmitted a drop of his primordial flames through the needle to melt the ball of solidified qi, and aid little fatty in clearing his energy channels.</p>
  <p>“Little brother, what are you doing? He’s going to die!” The beautiful young married woman actually complained!</p>
  <p>“Our medical doctor already said that this illness can never be cured. It’s an illness of the mind!”</p>
  <p>“Newborn calves are not afraid of the tiger!” A middle-aged sturdy man, carried a bag as he disdainfully said. This was because he was considered the best medical doctor in the region.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui paused for a long moment, before he retracted his needle, and at the same time, the little finger of the fatty, moved!</p>
  <p>The crowd watched with surprise as little fatty opened his eyes, looking around the crowd in a daze. In the instant he opened his eyes, Qing Shui knew that little fatty’s age wasn’t that old, as a tinge of childishness could be observed in both of his eyes.</p>
  <p>“Divine Doctor! He cured him so easily!”</p>
  <p>“Divine Doctor!”</p>
  <p>Divine Doctor!”</p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p>It was not known who first started calling out the words ‘Divine Doctor’. After it started the whole crowd was shouting along. Qing Shui felt a little embarrassed. After all, he wasn’t used to such situations.</p>
  <p>That sturdy middle-aged man had disappeared without a trace. This was the good point of those who lived in the mountains. They would envy, or even shoot you down with sarcasm, but they wouldn’t feel jealousy or hatred!</p>
  <p>“Little fatty, quickly thank this Divine Doctor. He was the one who had saved you!” The old man quickly instructed little fatty.</p>
  <p>“You are the one that saved me?” The voice of little fatty spoke in a low muffled voice. But one could hear that within his voice, it contained the vitality of Qi!</p>
  <p>“I guess so.” Qing Shui smiled as he warmly replied.</p>
  <p>The eyes of little fatty spun, gazing around the crowd before landing on Qing Shui. “Thank you, you are a good man.”</p>
  <p>Qing Shui, “…………………………..”</p>
  <p>“I wish to follow you in order to repay you for this debt of kindness.” The words of little fatty caused Qing Shui to be slightly stunned.</p>
  <p>“Your illness is cured, and will never surface again. There’s no need to thank me. I didn’t save you because I wanted you to repay me.” Qing Shui exasperatedly replied. Why would he need a little fatty to follow him around.</p>
  <p>“Before my brother passed away, he told me before that I must follow the one who saves me to repay them. I’m really very strong, and can do a lot of things for you.” The muffled voice of little fatty contained a hint of childishness.</p>
  <p>“Fatty is truly strong. He once killed a giant ape in the mountains barehanded!” The old man from earlier added.</p>
  <p>The gigantic mountain ape is an 8th grade ferocious beast. If he could kill it barehanded, then his strength level should be at around 5,000 jin. Qing Shui was shocked. This was truly inborn divine strength. Just his fleshly body alone, already possessed a strength level of 5,000 jin. How terrifying. In this desolate area, he could even claim to be the overlord if he so desired.</p>
  <p>“Please bring him along, we would always be worried if he were to remain on the mountain!” The beautiful young married wife urged.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui furrowed his brows as he regarded the beautiful young married woman who always had a sharp edge to her words. Earlier, he had only glanced at her. But now that he could look closely, she was indeed a top class beauty. Egg-shaped face, with a pair of charming phoenix eyes. Her hair was braided at the side, adding 30% to her charm. Her twin peaks were so well developed that they almost burst out of her clothes, and her willowy waist was so slender that one could hug it using only one hand. The shape of her ass was big and perky, supported by her jade-like long legs. The pink attire she wore was extremely attention grabbing, making her seem as if she were the sole crane amongst a crowd of chickens. She was indeed beautiful, just that her words were extremely harsh…</p>
  <p>Seeing Qing Shui looking at her, she winked flirtatiously. Unfortunately for her, Qing Shui had no interest in mean women.</p>
  <p>The skies had already darkened, so Qing Shui decided to accept little fatty as his follower. After all, the road ahead of him, was still long. “Mother, let’s rest for a night here, and we will pack up in the morning. As for fatty, let’s allow him to tag along with us.”</p>
  <p>Qing Yi laughed as she nodded.</p>
  <p>After the mountain people learned of their purpose in visiting here, many of them immediately stood up and offered their herbs for trade, thus saving Qing Yi and the rest a lot of trouble.</p>
  <p>“Little Divine Doctor, my house has herbs as well. Come over to my place later, I will pass you the herbs.” The beautiful young married woman whispered softly, and almost tempting Qing Shui. Ever since he had done the deed with Shi Qingzhuang, he had never done it again. Now, there was such a tempting woman in front of him, his rod couldn’t help but rise, as he felt the flames of lust burning.</p>
  <p>“Tomorrow, it’s very late now.” Qing Shui suppressed himself as he smiled and replied.</p>
  <p>Little fatty after knowing that Qing Shui was willing to take him in, felt very joyful in his heart. Only now did Qing Shui learn that this 2m tall, and 300 jin heavy little fatty, was only 15 years old, and was even younger than him by a year!</p>
  <p>In the end, they had decided to stay over at little fatty’s place, and return after they finished trading for herbs tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Upon reaching the house, little fatty said somewhat embarrassedly, “let me prepare some food for you.”</p>
  <p>In the end, Qing Shui stopped little fatty. Before they arrived, he had already made his preparations, and hunted two wild deers with the intention of eating them for dinner.</p>
  <p>During the meal, Qing Shui finally knew why little fatty was named little fatty. His appetite was even more than three men, but after thinking about his inborn divine strength, it was only to be expected.</p>
  <p>“After some adjustments are made, I can nurture a supporter out of him.” Qing Shui started thinking of ways to train little fatty. If his efforts were unsuccessful, then he could still put little fatty in the Green Wolf Gang for him to temper himself for 2-3 years.</p>
  <p>During the night, Qing Shui entered into his spatial realm. Ever since he had broken through, Qing Shui realized that the spatial realm had also undergone some changes. Other than the increases in his physical stats, even the rate in which he gained experience for alchemy also improved immensely. This held true as well for the experience he gained for his primordial needle technique!</p>
  <p>Now, his Ancient Strengthening Technique had already reached a total of 50 cycles of circulated Qi. The Free Spirit Steps as well as Solitary Rapid Fist had already been trained to the point of perfection.</p>
  <p>After exiting the spatial realm, Qing Shui decided to climb to the peak of the mountain. Tonight, the moon was dazzling and bright. The air of the mountains was also incomparably fresh.</p>
  <p>Leisurely walking up the mountains, the steps of Qing Shui were akin to a mountain cat: agile, nimble, and silent.</p>
  <p>Soon after beginning his climb, a faintly discernable sound broke the silence of the night, and drifted over. Qing Shui was stunned. These were just like the sounds of moaning that Shi Qingzhuang made when they were in the throes of passion.</p>
  <p>“Sex in public?” The burning lust in his heart surfaced once again.</p>
  <p>“Let’s treat it as a free show.” Qing Shui moved towards the sound of the noise.</p>
  <p>Behind a huge rock!</p>
  <p>A sturdy looking man and a well endowed young woman appeared in Qing Shui’s sight, in the reverse cowgirl position. The man was thrusting relentlessly up into the woman, while the woman was letting out moans of pleasure.</p>
  <p>After Qing Shui noticed the features of the women, he couldn’t help but to be shocked. This was none other than the young married wife earlier who had invited him to go over her place.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Qing Shui also recognised that sturdy guy. He was none other than the earlier doctor that was carrying a bag!</p>
  <p>The gaze of Qing Shui landed upon the twin peaks of that woman. The snow white mounds of flesh, quivered and shook with every thrust, causing Qing Shui to be dazzled.</p>
  <p>The beautiful young wife had her eyes closed in enjoyment as she moaned, allowing the sturdy guy to take the lead in the rhythm.</p>
  <p>After several moments, the pace of the guy slowed, and he let out a huge moan of satisfaction before the woman slumped over on top of him, her body quivering from the afterglow.</p>
  <p>“Pretty babe, is this comfortable? I’m so much better than your husband right!” The guy laughed with satisfaction, as he squeezed the woman’s breasts a couple of times.</p>
  <p>“Don’t remind me. His rod could only sustain its hardness for a few moments. It went limp before even entering me, how could it satisfy me?” The woman complained, somewhat helplessly.</p>
  <p>“Haha, if you are horny in the future, look for me. I’m available anytime. Satisfaction guaranteed!”</p>
  <p>“You are so annoying!”</p>
  <p>“F*ck, so wild? As the saying went, A woman in her 30s akin to a horny wolf, while a woman in her 40s is equivalent to a wild cougar. Sneaking out in the middle of night to f*ck around, simply because her husband was unable to satisfy her?” Qing Shui softly sighed.</p>
  <p>“One more time then!” The guy, after speaking, pressed the woman down, and started doing it missionary style.</p>
  <p>“Ah, the young doctor from earlier, was very attractive to look at.” The woman moaned softly.</p>
  <p>“You horny b*tch, I your father, after satisfying you, will go look for the young beautiful widow that was trading for herbs earlier. I’m sure that she would be even more satisfactory.” The sturdy man, as he spoke, continued to thrust his hips madly.</p>

 <p>“Your illness is cured, and will never surface again. There’s no need to thank me. I didn’t save you because I wanted you to repay me.” Qing Shui exasperatedly replied. Why would he need a little fatty to follow him around.</p>
 <p>“Before my brother passed away, he told me before that I must follow the one who saves me to repay them. I’m really very strong, and can do a lot of things for you.” The muffled voice of little fatty contained a hint of childishness.</p>
 <p>“Fatty is truly strong. He once killed a giant ape in the mountains barehanded!” The old man from earlier added.</p>
 <p>The gigantic mountain ape is an 8th grade ferocious beast. If he could kill it barehanded, then his strength level should be at around 5,000 jin. Qing Shui was shocked. This was truly inborn divine strength. Just his fleshly body alone, already possessed a strength level of 5,000 jin. How terrifying. In this desolate area, he could even claim to be the overlord if he so desired.</p>
 <p>“Please bring him along, we would always be worried if he were to remain on the mountain!” The beautiful young married wife urged.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui furrowed his brows as he regarded the beautiful young married woman who always had a sharp edge to her words. Earlier, he had only glanced at her. But now that he could look closely, she was indeed a top class beauty. Egg-shaped face, with a pair of charming phoenix eyes. Her hair was braided at the side, adding 30% to her charm. Her twin peaks were so well developed that they almost burst out of her clothes, and her willowy waist was so slender that one could hug it using only one hand. The shape of her ass was big and perky, supported by her jade-like long legs. The pink attire she wore was extremely attention grabbing, making her seem as if she were the sole crane amongst a crowd of chickens. She was indeed beautiful, just that her words were extremely harsh…</p>
 <p>Seeing Qing Shui looking at her, she winked flirtatiously. Unfortunately for her, Qing Shui had no interest in mean women.</p>
 <p>The skies had already darkened, so Qing Shui decided to accept little fatty as his follower. After all, the road ahead of him, was still long. “Mother, let’s rest for a night here, and we will pack up in the morning. As for fatty, let’s allow him to tag along with us.”</p>
 <p>Qing Yi laughed as she nodded.</p>
 <p>After the mountain people learned of their purpose in visiting here, many of them immediately stood up and offered their herbs for trade, thus saving Qing Yi and the rest a lot of trouble.</p>
 <p>“Little Divine Doctor, my house has herbs as well. Come over to my place later, I will pass you the herbs.” The beautiful young married woman whispered softly, and almost tempting Qing Shui. Ever since he had done the deed with Shi Qingzhuang, he had never done it again. Now, there was such a tempting woman in front of him, his rod couldn’t help but rise, as he felt the flames of lust burning.</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow, it’s very late now.” Qing Shui suppressed himself as he smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>Little fatty after knowing that Qing Shui was willing to take him in, felt very joyful in his heart. Only now did Qing Shui learn that this 2m tall, and 300 jin heavy little fatty, was only 15 years old, and was even younger than him by a year!</p>
 <p>In the end, they had decided to stay over at little fatty’s place, and return after they finished trading for herbs tomorrow.</p>
 <p>Upon reaching the house, little fatty said somewhat embarrassedly, “let me prepare some food for you.”</p>
 <p>In the end, Qing Shui stopped little fatty. Before they arrived, he had already made his preparations, and hunted two wild deers with the intention of eating them for dinner.</p>
 <p>During the meal, Qing Shui finally knew why little fatty was named little fatty. His appetite was even more than three men, but after thinking about his inborn divine strength, it was only to be expected.</p>
 <p>“After some adjustments are made, I can nurture a supporter out of him.” Qing Shui started thinking of ways to train little fatty. If his efforts were unsuccessful, then he could still put little fatty in the Green Wolf Gang for him to temper himself for 2-3 years.</p>
 <p>During the night, Qing Shui entered into his spatial realm. Ever since he had broken through, Qing Shui realized that the spatial realm had also undergone some changes. Other than the increases in his physical stats, even the rate in which he gained experience for alchemy also improved immensely. This held true as well for the experience he gained for his primordial needle technique!</p>
 <p>Now, his Ancient Strengthening Technique had already reached a total of 50 cycles of circulated Qi. The Free Spirit Steps as well as Solitary Rapid Fist had already been trained to the point of perfection.</p>
 <p>After exiting the spatial realm, Qing Shui decided to climb to the peak of the mountain. Tonight, the moon was dazzling and bright. The air of the mountains was also incomparably fresh.</p>
 <p>Leisurely walking up the mountains, the steps of Qing Shui were akin to a mountain cat: agile, nimble, and silent.</p>
 <p>Soon after beginning his climb, a faintly discernable sound broke the silence of the night, and drifted over. Qing Shui was stunned. These were just like the sounds of moaning that Shi Qingzhuang made when they were in the throes of passion.</p>
 <p>“Sex in public?” The burning lust in his heart surfaced once again.</p>
 <p>“Let’s treat it as a free show.” Qing Shui moved towards the sound of the noise.</p>
 <p>Behind a huge rock!</p>
 <p>A sturdy looking man and a well endowed young woman appeared in Qing Shui’s sight, in the reverse cowgirl position. The man was thrusting relentlessly up into the woman, while the woman was letting out moans of pleasure.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui noticed the features of the women, he couldn’t help but to be shocked. This was none other than the young married wife earlier who had invited him to go over her place.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Qing Shui also recognised that sturdy guy. He was none other than the earlier doctor that was carrying a bag!</p>
 <p>The gaze of Qing Shui landed upon the twin peaks of that woman. The snow white mounds of flesh, quivered and shook with every thrust, causing Qing Shui to be dazzled.</p>
 <p>The beautiful young wife had her eyes closed in enjoyment as she moaned, allowing the sturdy guy to take the lead in the rhythm.</p>
 <p>After several moments, the pace of the guy slowed, and he let out a huge moan of satisfaction before the woman slumped over on top of him, her body quivering from the afterglow.</p>
 <p>“Pretty babe, is this comfortable? I’m so much better than your husband right!” The guy laughed with satisfaction, as he squeezed the woman’s breasts a couple of times.</p>
 <p>“Don’t remind me. His rod could only sustain its hardness for a few moments. It went limp before even entering me, how could it satisfy me?” The woman complained, somewhat helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Haha, if you are horny in the future, look for me. I’m available anytime. Satisfaction guaranteed!”</p>
 <p>“You are so annoying!”</p>
 <p>“F*ck, so wild? As the saying went, A woman in her 30s akin to a horny wolf, while a woman in her 40s is equivalent to a wild cougar. Sneaking out in the middle of night to f*ck around, simply because her husband was unable to satisfy her?” Qing Shui softly sighed.</p>
 <p>“One more time then!” The guy, after speaking, pressed the woman down, and started doing it missionary style.</p>
 <p>“Ah, the young doctor from earlier, was very attractive to look at.” The woman moaned softly.</p>
 <p>“You horny b*tch, I your father, after satisfying you, will go look for the young beautiful widow that was trading for herbs earlier. I’m sure that she would be even more satisfactory.” The sturdy man, as he spoke, continued to thrust his hips madly.</p>
