 <p><strong>AST 1178 - Hurricane Dragon-boned Rock, Assassin’s Sword</strong></p>
 <p>These were Yan Dingtian's children who were more outstanding. Qing Shui didn't need to guess to know that Yan Dingtian didn't only have these children, not the fact that he wouldn't just have this one wife. There must be a reason why these people were here together today.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sat between Yan Jinyu and Yan Yangzhao. The others had wanted him to sit at the head of the table but Qing Shui knew that it wasn't appropriate and they didn't insist.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangchi was Yan Dingtian's oldest child and he was also the strongest. At least, even though Qing Shui couldn't tell what his exact strength was at, he knew that this guy was definitely very strong.</p>
 <p>There was also Yan Yueyin. This lady's fluctuating aura was very special. Qing Shui thought of what she had said earlier, that her name was very useful around the place. It seemed that she should be very powerful.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you've treated Jinyu too well. Even I am jealous of her weapon." Yan Yueyin sat opposite Qing Shui and smiled, saying.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that something like this would be brought up sooner or later but it was just that since they had just got to know each other, they shouldn't bring it up too soon.</p>
 <p>"I don't have the necessary materials. If Sister Yueyin has them, I'll be able to forge one for you very quickly. However, I don't know if you'd be satisfied with it. The one that Sister Yan has is largely due to luck as well," Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Haha, I was just teasing you. If I really were to need a weapon, I won't stand on ceremony with you. Sister Jinyu is too stingy. Earlier when I had seen that weapon, she refused to tell me who had made it. It was Yangzhao who guessed it." Yan Yueyin smiled charmingly and teasingly.</p>
 <p>"Since everyone is treating me like family, there's not need to stand on ceremony. I only have this little ability. If it can be of use, there's no need to stand on ceremony with me." Qing Shui wasn't against things like this and it was very normal. If there were no accidents, these were things which would happen sooner or later.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, I'm a straightforward person and I won't stand on ceremony with you. I'm not satisfied with my current weapons and armor and will get your help later. For the upcoming competition, I'll have to be a little shameless and approach you, even if it’s for the sake of my reputation," Yan Yangchen smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"2nd Brother, you've always been very thick-skinned," Yan Huoyun let out a crisp smile and said.</p>
 <p>Yan Huoyun's words caused everyone to break into laughter. Even Qing Shui also smiled and said, "I like 2nd Brother's straightforwardness. Don't worry, leave this to me. I'll definitely let you feel satisfied."</p>
 <p>Everyone then chatted over the meal. They were all youngsters and had common topics to talk about. Most of the time, Yan Dingtian and his beautiful wife would just watch from the side.</p>
 <p>"Father, have the participants for the upcoming competition been decided?" About halfway into their meal, Yan Jinyu looked toward Yan Dingtian and asked, smiling.</p>
 <p>"More or less, but we haven't decided all of them. There'll be Yangchi, Yangchen, Yueyin, Leng`er and you. As for the rest, they'll be chosen from amongst your cousins." Yan Yueyin smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Let me participate as well!" It was then did Yan Yangzhao spoke up.,</p>
 <p>"Yangzhao, you should focus on your cultivation. The matter this time around is of utmost important. Otherwise, I'd have let you get a chance to spar. Both sides will be going all out and will be fighting a life and death battle." When Yan Dingtian said this, it was with a heavy tone.</p>
 <p>Yan Dingtian's words caused everyone to fall sullen. These were his most outstanding children and Yu Clan was a great clan as well. Since they dared to challenge Yan Clan, they must definitely have confidence in their powers. If something were to happen to any of these children, it would deal a huge blow to him as well.</p>
 <p>They say that people won't be able to grow and rise to great heights if they weren't put through obstacles. However, when the time really came, no father would be too willing to let his children go through all that.</p>
 <p>"Uncle, I'll be setting up a blacksmith store near Yan Clan these few days. Please get Sister Yan to inform me on the day of the competition." Qing Shui smiled and said to Yan Dingtian.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, you've saved Jinyu but I've yet to thank you. Since you're a blacksmith, you can have these." Yan Dingtian took out an interspatial silk sachet and handed it to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"I can't accept that. We're all family and moreover, I don't wish for anything to taint our relationship as siblings between Sister Yan and myself." Qing Shui smiled and rejected Yan Dingtian's kind intentions.</p>
 <p>"Alright, then treat them as a meeting gift from me. That should be fine, right?" Yan Dingtian broke into a warm and gentle smile. He liked this lad a lot, who was neither arrogant nor hot-headed and was very rational. It was no wonder that he could get along with the lass.</p>
 <p>After a slight hesitation, Qing Shui smiled and received it, "Then I'll thank uncle for this!"</p>
 <p>"Right, let Jinyu bring you to help you to set up your blacksmith store," Yan Dingtian said to Qing Shui and Yan Jinyu.</p>
 <p>"Let me do it! Qing Shui had promised me previously that if he were to come to inner city, he'll leave everything to me," Yan Yangzhao quickly said.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui brought up the matter with the blacksmith store, he knew that it would still need to take a few days. After the feast ended, Qing Shui took a look at the ingredients Yan Dingtian gave him and was very taken aback. There were high quality otherworldly meteorite, 10,000 Years metallic essence, Thunder Rock...</p>
 <p>"2nd Brother, what kind of weapons do you use and what elements does your martial arts belong to? I'll take a look to see what kind of weapons and armor are more suitable," Qing Shui looked at Yan Yangchen and said. Yan Dingtian and his wife had already left.</p>
 <p>"I use a hammer, one that's like this. I cultivate earth element martial techniques." Yan Yangchen quickly brought out his own hammers.</p>
 <p>There were a pair of battle hammers and each of them was bigger than the person himself. They were grey colored and looked extremely heavy. In all, this weapon was still considered quite powerful. Qing Shui sensed it a little and understood why Yan Yangchen had wanted them replaced. Although this Mountain Splitting Hammer was considered decent, it only increased the user's strength by threefold. The other attributes were mediocre as well.</p>
 <p>The others didn't get Qing Shui's help to forge. However, Yan Leng hesitated for very long before he spoke unnaturally, "Qing Shui, can you help me forge a weapon? I'll trade it for something..."</p>
 <p>"Brother Leng, why are you standing on ceremony with me? I'm not fit to be your brother?" Qing Shui knew that this was how unsociable people were. Unless they were forced to a certain level, they wouldn't ask for someone else's help.</p>
 <p>"That's not it. Then I shan't stand on ceremony. I hope that you can help me forge a lighter sword that has high agility. It'll be best if it can penetrate armor. You can just forge one to your capability. I cultivate wind element martial techniques and focus on speed and flow. I'll have to trouble you for this. I have suitable materials here." Yan Leng said politely.</p>
 <p>"Alright. Can I have a look at Brother Leng's previous weapon?"</p>
 <p>"I forgot about that. It's like this." Yan Leng took out a weapon that was similar to a long dagger from his sleeves. The sword had a width of two fingers and length of close to two feet.</p>
 <p>"I'll do my best to satisfy Brother Leng." Qing Shui smiled and promised.</p>
 <p>"Alright, Qing Shui, do you have things you need to take care of? If you tell me, I might be able to help you." Just then, Yan Yueyin smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"You're really going to help me?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Of course. This is the first time sister so willingly helps someone. Tell me and I'll see if I can help you with it," Yan Yueyin smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"I really do have something to do. This is the reason I'm setting up a blacksmith store as well. I'm looking for someone. She's my wife but it's just that I don't know where she is now." Qing Shui took out Di Chen's portrait.</p>
 <p>"Your wife is really pretty. How long has it been since you've seen her? Are you sure that she's in Great Yu Dynasty?" Yan Yueyin threw a glance toward Yan Yueyin from the corner of her eyes as she said this.</p>
 <p>"I don't know. It has been five years since she had came to Western Oxhe Continent. I don't know where she is either. She had to come to the Great Yu Dynasty first. If it's convenient, I'll trouble Sister Yueyin to help me keep a lookout." Qing Shui smiled. He actually didn't hold much hope for this and was just saying this out of courtesy.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, can you leave this portrait with me first? I'll help you to ask around." Yan Yueyin gave it some thought and said.</p>
 <p>"Alright!"</p>
 <p>This portrait was one which Qing Shui had drawn himself. It wasn't one of the portraits of beauty.</p>
 <p>That night, Qing Shui hammered away in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Even if the weapons were ready, he wouldn't give them immediately. Good weapons weren't forged so quickly. Although the one he had given to Yan Jinyu was too fast.</p>
 <p>The hammer that Qing Shui forged for Yan Yangchen was a pair of huge World Demolitions. This hammer wouldn't lose out even when compared with the Thunder God. It could be said that due to the powerful forging abilities, the hammer's prowess was even greater. Qing Shui's memory of those weapons in his consciousness wasn't very accurate. It was just like how the Big Dipper Sword was no weaker when compared to the Mystical Connection Divine Sword and the Four Elements Greencloud Sword. It meant that it was all related to one's forging abilities and the materials used.</p>
 <p>Although this was the first time Qing Shui had tried to forge a hammer, it was very smooth-sailing. He had even engraved the Seal Formations as well, the same ones he had engraved on the Four Elements Greencloud Sword. The battle armor was heavier and more bulky and the Seal Formation he used for it was the Divine Shield Seal Formation. Other than that, he also forged a few pairs of boots, engraving the Gale Seal Formation onto them. He had also forged armor and battle skirts for Yan Jinyu. Of course, he would also be giving them to the other participants of the competition since he couldn't be seen to be biased. Therefore, he had them prepared earlier.</p>
 <p>The attributes for the World Demolition were slightly inferior to the Big Dipper Sword. The increment in spirit energy attacks was only 50% but the other attributes were about the same as the Four Elements Greencloud Sword. Moreover, there was also a 20% increment to speed and attacking speed.</p>
 <p>These were very important. Usually, earth element martial technique would tend to lose out in terms of speed. This additional 20% increment could make up for a lot of the difference. Moreover, with an additional pair of boots, his strength would probably increase by a lot and even more so, his battle prowess.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was forging Yan Leng's weapon, Qing Shui used the materials Yan Leng had given him. One of the raw material was very good, the Hurricane Dragon-boned Rock.</p>
 <p>This was a rare material and when added, it could greatly increase agility and spirit energy.</p>
 <p>There weren't many materials but the forging process was very smooth. Moreover, he added in the Celestial Stone and the success rate had increased to become 100%.</p>
 <p>When the weapon was completed, Qing Shui was very satisfied with the attributes.</p>
 <p>Hurricane Dragon-boned Sword: Increase user's strength by five fold, spirit energy by one fold and has a 20% chance of doubling the prowess of attacks, including for spirit energy attacks. The user's movement and attacking speed would be increased by twofold and there's a 20% chance of further doubling the user's attacking and movement speed. The user's depletion would also be reduced by 20%.</p>
 <p>Armor penetration. There's a 10% chance of penetrating through the opponent's defense to a certain degree, including physical defense, battle armor and Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation. The degree of penetration was related to the user's abilities as well as the opponent's abilities.</p>
 <p>This was a weapon intended for assassins and could be considered a powerful weapon. When used together with a pair of boots, the prowess would be very terrifying. Even Yan Yangchi or Yan Yueyin might not be able to win against Yan Leng then.</p>
 <p>In one-on-one fights, assassins are the most terrifying!</p>
