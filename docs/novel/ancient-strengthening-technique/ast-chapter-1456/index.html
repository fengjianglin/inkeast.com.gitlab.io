She was a bit confused and asked, “Why would you come up with such an idea all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Tantai Lingyan showed up. Instead of answering the question, Qing SHui smiled and looked as the woman sat down beside Hua Rumei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shall I leave for a while first?” Hua Rumei smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes you should!” Qing Shui nodded and said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, destroying the bridge after crossing the river, is it?” Hua Rumei smiled and looked at Qing Shui. As she was doing so, she already stood up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am just joking. There is nothing going on between me and Lingyan…… Sit down. Lingyan hasn’t even said anything about it. For all you know, even you may have to be involved in the things which she mentioned.” Qing Shui said in an awkward tone but right now, there’s an unnatural expression on Tantai Lingyan’s face as though she was thinking about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I naturally know you guys are innocent. Palace Lord isn’t somebody so easily pursued. You have to work harder.” Hua Rumei teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Rumei was probably the only person who would dare to joke about things like these.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She hasn’t really fallen for me yet. I will try my best for it.” Qing Shui rubbed his nose and said because he could tell that Tantai Lingyan wasn’t unhappy about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, we will have plenty of time for that in the future, so let’s save that for later on. Let’s first see what our ice cold goddess have to say for this first.” Hua Rumei pulled Tantai Lingyan and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I came across a warrior who slipped through my sight by chances. I intend to face off against him with you. He is currently residing in Great Yan Dynasty and has a clothing store of his own.” Tantai Lingyan said while looking at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A small time hermit hides in the mountain, a normal hermit lives downtown, but a real hermit hide themselves in the dynasties.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A small time hermit hides in the mountain, whereas a normal hermit lives downtown. Mountains were too secluded, whereas cities could sometimes be really noisy. So why not choose for a lifestyle that’s in the middle of the two of them? A place where it wouldn’t be too noisy nor too secluded?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was a person in hiding. If it wasn’t because Tantai Lingyan ran into him by chances, it’s unlikely that she would ever find him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, shall we go now or?” Qing Shui&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will go now!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister, it’s best you remain here to avoid alerting the enemy.” Qing Shui said after looking at Tantai Lingyan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then. You guys, be on alert when you guys are there. Qing Shui, please look after our Palace Lord.” Hua Rumei didn’t insist on following. With Qing Shui around, she wasn’t too worried about the Palace Lord. At least escaping wouldn’t be a problem for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is for sure. As long as I still live, I won’t let anyone cause even a single scratch on her.” Qing Shui revealed a gentle smile. After that, together with Tantai Lingyan, they departed from the palace backyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prior to this, when Tantai Lingyan heard what Qing Shui said, she slightly lowered her head. She felt that someone actually cared about her. In the past, she has also had similar feelings. For example, when she was with Hua Rumei, a long, long time ago, she also had her own families. But it was different compared to now. This was a feeling which words alone couldn’t describe. Little by little, she found herself slowly becoming fond of this feeling. Somehow, she felt safe when battling alongside this person. She felt relaxed, which was probably the reason why she came to look for Qing Shui, and also probably the reason for the changes taking place in her. If it had been the her in the past, she would have definitely gone there on her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were less than a thousand Lis away. At a blink of an eye, they were already near their destination. After that, they both neared the clothing store which was already within sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Residence Clothing Store!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan approached the clothing store. When they were almost there, Tantai Lingyan took off her bamboo hat. Her beauty which belonged to the other world managed to attract a lot of the people’s attention. Considering that this was a less advanced place, the people here would normally be less daring. The most which they would do was secretly look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that there were already more than ten young men crowding in front of the entrance. Certainly, it was quite ordinary for there to be a few sex-driven men among them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, what’s your opinion on the lass?” A young man asked when he saw Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Judging by her body, even if she had an ugly face, there is still people who will want her. Even if she was to have her face covered, she would still look like a fairy who came down from the sky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third brother, you truly have really good imagination. Since that’s the case, what are we waiting for? Let’s bring her back and toy around with her first. We will only look at her face once we’re done toying around with her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu-wu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked as if the young man who was speaking suddenly got choked in the neck by someone. His eyes which resembled that of a rat’s eyes were filled with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold voice came through. About ten people from the opposite side immediately got killed by Tantai Lingyan’s aura alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of trash must have bullied numerous people. They deserved their death. Even if Tantai Lingyan hadn’t done anything, Qing Shui would do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, the both of them right away entered the clothing store.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no one left in the store. Everyone ran immediately as soon as they saw someone killed. Some ran off very far away into the distance but still had their eyes in the things happening around here. This was a very courageous action. As soon as when one thought about someone getting killed, the normal thing which they would do was running off as far away as they could from the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no one left in the clothing store. The entire clothing store was only the size of about a hundred square meters. This kind of size was already considered to be really small.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys are here!” A voice filled with wisdom came through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the cloth store, only the old man at the back of the table remained. The old man had a really wise look. His beard that was snow white in color immediately reminded Qing Shui of Santa Claus whom he used to hear about in his previous incarnation. They really did look alike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, to think that the famous Bloody Butcher Chen Yuanhua would be here today looking after a cloth store……” Tantai Lingyan spoke gently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, I was really reckless and as a result, it has caused me to make a lot of mistakes. This was the reason why I chose to live my life as an ordinary person.” The old man said in a calm tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One who murders must pay the forfeit with his life. You are a very powerful figure. We are going to battle against each other today. As for whether you live or die today, it will be decided by gods. You can also look for helpers if you want.” Tantai Lingyan said in a cold tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you really not spare my life?” The old man knitted his brows ands said in a gentle tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I have got my seniors watching over me. Either one of us must die today.” Tantai Lingyan said in a firm tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I refuse to kill anymore people.” The old man once again let out a sigh as he looked at Tantai Lingyan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s still not yet certain that you will be able to kill us. We will wait for you outside.” Tantai Lingyan went outside along with qing Shui after she finished speaking. They stopped in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui immediately raised his condition all the way to its peak and used the Tiger Wing Halo, causing the both of them to experience a great increase in strength. Originally, the location where Qing Shui was at provided him with a 25% boost whereas the location where the woman stood provided her with only a 10% boost. But Qing Shui still could choose two other options for it. One was to either switch positions with each other while the other one was to divide up the power boost and make it equal for each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment of thought, Qing Shui decided to switch position and boosted the woman’s offensive prowess by 25%. In any case, the woman was originally already stronger than him to begin with. He continued on to further boost her strength all the way until it was 45% boosted with his Phoenix’s Battle Intent and Heavenly Talismans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui in disbelief. This man has given her surprises after surprises. The surprise this time was by far the biggest one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong? Are you thinking that i look a lot more handsome than before?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Tantai Lingyan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, you look a lot uglier than before.” Tantai Lingyan said in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wouldn’t take what she said seriously. On the contrary, he felt that little by little, the woman was slowly opening up her heart for him. Actually, the woman was only joking. But the expression of her when she said it would make people felt that she was being serious. Despite this, Qing Shui was able to sense the changes in her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingyan, I would like to ask you a question. Do you think that you are beautiful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan stunned, “I have no idea. No one has talked to me about this before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought over it and found it reasonable. Who would dare to tell her about it? As a matter of fact, she might not even have conversed much with men. As he saw the woman still looking back at him, he smiled, “You are an ice-cold but very beautiful woman. You look as pretty as a fairy, and at the same time also cold as ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, the old man appeared from below and very quickly, he already made it to the opposite side&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys were the ones who forced me to do this. I am very reluctant to continue killing people. But yet, all of you refused to let me be a good person. Since that’s the case, my only way to solve this would be to kill every single one of you.” The old man’s aura underwent an abrupt change as soon as he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man from before was like a santa claus. He looked so wise that one would never picture him to have hands fully stained with blood. But now, as soon as the old man’s aura changed, a faint bloody aura started spreading around the area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a famous figure within Soaring Dragon Continent. The Bloody Butcher Chen Yuanhua.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, both of his eyes started to turn red. He emitted violent aura which resembled that of an ancient violent beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t dare to let down his guard even for one second. The old man was too violent. The aura which he emitted didn’t feel at all like that of a normal human. He immediately summoned the Dragon Slaying Beast and followed it up by using Emperor’s Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He feared that he wouldn’t make it in time.</span></p>

Qing Shui then took this opportunity to toss out a bundle of Heavenly Talismans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Make your move now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine Continents Mountain!</span></p>

After that, he made the Dragon Slaying Beast waited at one side to store up its energy.</span></p>

Both of his eyes looked as if they were shooting out bloody red light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is a descendant of the Blood Demon King but he hasn’t obtain the inheritance. Despite so, his talent is extremely high and a successor who inherited the inheritance might not be more powerful than him.” Tantai Lingyan held the Supreme Devil Equipment and dashed over after she finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor’s Qi!</span></p>

For example, if the strength of the old man is rated 100, after the Heavenly Talisman is activated, he would be left with 90. But Emperor Qi’s is not a reduction of opponent’s total strength capacity but was a reduction of current strength capacity instead. Hence after the Heavenly Talisman effect, the Emperor Qi would kick in and reduct another 20% out of the 90.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, if he was to use the Emperor’s Qi now, it would negate the effect of Emperor’s Qi from before. Hence, he chose to go with the Heavenly Talisman first so that he could weaken slightly more of his opponent’s strength. This was something which Qing Shui found out himself after experimenting with his techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant when the Dragon Slaying Beast penetrated through the Nine Continents Mountain, it swiftly leaped onto the old man.&nbsp;</span></p>

He abruptly blast out his palm and sent the Dragon Slaying Beast flying.</span></p>
