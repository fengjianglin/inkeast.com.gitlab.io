 <p><strong>Chapter 556 Sixth Level of Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 556 - Sixth Level of Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">She was exquisitely charming. Her eyes were as soft as silk!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui tasted her lower body bit by bit. As they made out, they took off their clothes pieces by pieces until they were completely naked. With their bodies facing each other, Qing Shui’s heart raced when he saw the impressive silhouette of her body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li had a slim powdered neck, and moderately-sized supple breasts. Her breasts were not very bulbous, but Qing Shui’s palms were not able to cover her entire breasts as he groped them. However, Liu-Li’s breasts were bouncy and soft to touch, which left a fascinating visual impact for Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Qing Shui’s Unnamed Duo Cultivation Technique began circulating once more. He held Huoyun Liu-Li tightly in his arms and stopped moving. However, the Qi Force continued to circulate inside his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">An enormous amount of energy flowed from his private part into his body while simultaneously purifying his spirit. In an instant, Qing Shui felt that all the bones in his body had been cleansed thoroughly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After another round of Qi Force circulation, Qing Shui’s eyes brightened when he suddenly felt a sense of liberation, as if something had been cleared inside his body. But after a while, his senses returned to normal. He was speechless about the weird sensation because he didn’t have a clear understanding of what it was.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After three circulations, Qing Shui had stopped receiving the flow of energy into his body. However, Huoyun Liu-Li who was beneath him suddenly emitted numerous flickers of halo light from her body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li opened her mesmerizing eyes and looked at Qing Shui with disbelief. Who knew that having sex would be able to heighten their strength….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The strength of Grade Five Martial King!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui found it beyond comprehension. Not only had her strength greatly improved, but the constitution of her body had also developed by a moderate amount.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui strongly believed that she and Canghai Mingyue could be in possession of the rumored Divine Bodies described in the Portrait of Beauty!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a series of developments, Qing Shui couldn’t wait to ravage her, so he began to take siege of her body immediately after that. He engulfed himself with the pleasure of sexual ecstasy until his back began to feel sore.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they were done, both of them winded down and laid back on the bed together. Huoyun Liu-Li fell asleep soundly on his arms due to the extreme fatigue from the intercourse. Qing Shui, on the other hand, could not fall asleep for some reason.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gazed at Huoyun Liu-Li’s genuinely satisfied expression as she drifted off to her dreams. The faint blush from the rush of having sex still remained on her cheeks. It was the most beautiful color he had ever seen - this faint shade of red had a mesmerizing glow to it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stayed at her side until she had fallen into a deep sleep. By this time, it was already midnight. He got up slowly without disturbing her and left quietly. Qing Shui felt helpless about his situation; he had to continue his cultivation while satisfying his women while being a hero to many at the same time!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The reason he had decided to relieve himself with Huoyun Liu-Li was because he didn’t have the mood to cultivate his skills. He also felt partly guilty for her as well as the other ladies because he couldn’t devote an entire night to them, much less accompany them past midnight.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he went back to his room, the first thing he did was to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. But when he stepped into the realm, he was stunned by what he saw!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The realm had expanded in size, and was much bigger compared to before. Qing Shui knew exactly what caused this - an upgrade. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had finally upgraded…..</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui roughly estimated that the width and height of the realm had increased by a thousand meters. The sole pond in the middle of the realm had also expanded by a hundred meter or more. In an instant, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had transformed into an area more spacious by numerous folds.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although he hadn't see the descriptions inscribed on the stone monument, he was certain that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had experienced an upgrade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He already had a nagging suspicion during his intercourse with Huoyun Liu-Li, especially during the time both of them were experiencing a change inside their bodies. At the same time, Qing Shui felt a surge of spiritual energy inside his body, a familiar sensation that happened every time the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had been upgraded. He wasn't certain at that point, but then he saw it with his own eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had also gained a moderate amount of spiritual energy during his intercourse with Canghai Mingyue back then. Because of that, he was able to miraculously revive part of his vitals that had been severely damaged.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui had broken through to the Sixth Level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He knew he wouldn't have been able to upgrade the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal with Huoyun Liu-Li alone. Canghai Mingyue’s help was also indispensable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He still couldn't figure out the requirement to upgrade the realm after all this time. Initially, he thought that all he needed to do was to have intercourse with women in order to upgrade the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, this theory was debunked when the realm experienced an upgrade without him having sex with a woman. But it wasn't completely debunked because a woman was also involved in the breakthrough.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his head trying to figure out the exact trigger for the breakthrough. Nevertheless, the realm had upgraded to the next level, so it was a good thing worth celebrating. He then walked towards the stone monument near the pond to see what kind of surprises he would get from the upgrade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Nine-Petal Lotus in the middle of the water seemed significantly smaller as the pond had expanded. The depth of the pond had increased as well. It was deeper than it used to be.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The marine species consisting of fishes, prawns, turtles, and crabs had dispersed around the pond. It was more pleasing to his eyes because it wasn't that cramped anymore.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the stone monument did not change at all in terms of its size! Qing Shui was excited to see what words were inscribed on the stone monument!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">First level, unlocked!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Second level, unlocked!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sixth level, unlocked!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It only felt real when he read those words on the stone monument. He was ecstatic to know that the realm had indeed broken through to the sixth level. Qing Shui was excited to see what kind of rare rewards would come with this upgrade as he continued to the next line.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The first reward was a Five Elements Fruit Tree, which would bear ten fruits once it had ripened every hundred years. Each fruit was able to strengthen the ability of the five elements attributions, allowing the user to cultivate techniques that corresponded to their elements to yield twice the result with half the effort. The Five Elements Fruit would not increase the consumer’s strength, but it could improve the consumer’s bodily constitution and lifeforce. Most importantly, the fruit would be able to purify the consumer’s corresponding element as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s element was Earth. If he were to consume an Earth element fruit, he would be able to increase the purity level of his element. He would discover an unexpected boost in the speed and the strength of his Ancient Strengthening Technique or other Earth elemental techniques once he started his cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Five Elements Fruit Tree, as reflected by its name, had fruits of the five elements, namely Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each person was only allowed to consume the fruits corresponding to their own elements. If they were to consume fruits other than their element, they would not be able to reap the benefits of the Five Element Fruit. Furthermore, one person could only have one corresponding element.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is good!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t expect this surprise the reward would bring to him. The Five Elements Fruits were considered rare items in the World of Nine Continents. These fruits were very special and valuable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Normally, one would only be required to eat one fruit or a number of Five Elements Fruits that would match the five elements of their body. That way, one would be able to proceed with their cultivation using techniques that corresponded to the five elements. In any case, a cultivator would be able to achieve a greater battle skill as long as the techniques have been applied and the techniques used reached a certain level of mastery.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A person was only allowed to eat up to ten Five Elements Fruits that corresponded to their own elements!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then recalled about the Five Elements Heavenly Fruits that were required to break through to the Martial Saint Realm - these fruits were also categorized into five elements. Despite the similarity, Qing Shui could not figure out the relation between the Five Elements Fruits and the Five Elements Heavenly Fruits required for the breakthrough to Martial Saint.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, the Five Elements Fruit may be inferior because one person was allowed to eat ten of them. Because of that, Qing Shui didn’t think the fruits that the Five Elements Tree bore would be on par with the quality of the legendary Five Elements Heavenly Fruits in the World of Nine Continents.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He perished his thoughts and shifted his focus onto the next few rewards!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten 3,000 year Milkvetch!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten 3,000 year Thousand Orchid!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten 3,000 year Blood Jade Ginseng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was quite pleased with these rewards. He had received fifteen types of 3,000 year herbs, and they were all very decent as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Although these herbs were satisfactory, Qing Shui did not feel as excited as he thought he would be. He felt that these herbs were less than half as exquisite compared to the first reward, the Five Elements Fruit.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui didn't mind because these 3,000 years herbs would eventually become 4,000 years herbs or medicines of higher quality in no time with the help of his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Moreover, these herbs were originally grown in abundance in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next reward was a total of 300 Rainbow Trout Fishes - the species that would lay one hundred eggs once in a hundred years. After that, it would take another hundred years for the little fishes to mature. Each fish has the ability to increase one’s energy level by two hundred Jin, as well as strengthening the consumer’s meridians and the vital organs of their body. They would also feel as if their spirit has been cleansed slightly after consuming the fish. Moreover, they would still be able to feel the effects until they had consumed ten Rainbow Trout Fishes in a year, because consuming more than ten fishes a year would not yield any more energy or strengthen the body anymore. In any case, the fish tasted delicious on its own; it could also be used as a component of medicine, and as an ingredient for wine as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was ecstatic. The Rainbow Trout Fish was the evolution of the Gold Horn Firetail Fish, and most importantly, the number of eggs the Rainbow Trout Fish would lay was more impressive than its former form.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Theoretically, even if half of the 300 fishes were male and the other half were female, they would still produce a few million offsprings in two years….. Qing Shui looked back at the large pond and smiled widely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next reward was a ‘Mysterious Fruit Tree’ that would only produce one fruit in every 500 years. After the fruit was consumed, it would have a 1 % chance of giving a random unexpected result. The result would be a random increase in one of the following: strength, defense, or speed; a breakthrough for a random martial art technique; or the comprehension of the five elements profound theory of any cultivation technique.....</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confused by the Mysterious Fruit Tree and the fruit’s capability. He knew it was a good item, but he was a bit iffy about the concept. The tree would bear one fruit every 500 years, and the fruit would have a 1 % chance of an unexpected reward….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even with the realm’s extraordinary time mechanic, the tree would only bear a fruit once every three years. Without the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he could only stare at the tree and still could not force it to produce a fruit. Moreover, the lifespan of a Xiantian martial warrior was at least 500 years, and the lifespan of a Martial Saint warrior would be around 1,000 years….&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In three years, he thought, he would be able to pick the Mysterious Fruit. At least it was more acceptable than waiting for 500 years. In addition to that, it would be out of this world if he were to hit the jackpot on the 1 % chance of a rare gift.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The next reward was a bee nest consisting of an army of one hundred Jade Emperor Bees. These bees were able to speed up the growth of medicinal herbs by 10 %. Additionally, the Jade Emperor Queen Bee that led her armies of bees would be able to produce ten offsprings once in a hundred year. The matured Jade Emperor Bees would have at least the strength of a Martial King, whereas the Jade Emperor Queen Bee would have the strength of a Peak Martial King. The Jade Emperor Bee had a very long body, yet they were known to be extremely fast and poisonous. Each year, these bees would be able to harvest ten Jin of Jade Emperor Queen Bee Nectar.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jade Emperor Queen Bee Nectar has the ability to enhance the potential of the human body, and strengthen the physique of one's body!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What the fuck!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but swear at the sight of the enhancements the nectar could give. Meanwhile, the Martial King level Jade Emperor Bees were buzzing around with the Peak Martial King Jade Emperor Queen Bee in the middle of the hive. He was delighted to know that the bees were exceptionally agile and had a poisonous sting.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The rewards from the Sixth Layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were truly remarkable. However, the list still went on. So without hesitation, Qing Shui continued looking at the list of rewards calmly. Despite that, he wanted to finish reading the rewards quickly so that he could check the items on the spot….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next reward: 2000 Jin of Violet Jade. A localized material that could be used for forging and refining!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten cinnamon spices, and ten Purple Bamboo Tea!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Next reward: The ratio of time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal has become 1:200. Time allowed in the realm has been expanded to six hours!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">After three circulations, Qing Shui had stopped receiving the flow of energy into his body. However, Huoyun Liu-Li who was beneath him suddenly emitted numerous flickers of halo light from her body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li opened her mesmerizing eyes and looked at Qing Shui with disbelief. Who knew that having sex would be able to heighten their strength….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The strength of Grade Five Martial King!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even Qing Shui found it beyond comprehension. Not only had her strength greatly improved, but the constitution of her body had also developed by a moderate amount.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui strongly believed that she and Canghai Mingyue could be in possession of the rumored Divine Bodies described in the Portrait of Beauty!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a series of developments, Qing Shui couldn’t wait to ravage her, so he began to take siege of her body immediately after that. He engulfed himself with the pleasure of sexual ecstasy until his back began to feel sore.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they were done, both of them winded down and laid back on the bed together. Huoyun Liu-Li fell asleep soundly on his arms due to the extreme fatigue from the intercourse. Qing Shui, on the other hand, could not fall asleep for some reason.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gazed at Huoyun Liu-Li’s genuinely satisfied expression as she drifted off to her dreams. The faint blush from the rush of having sex still remained on her cheeks. It was the most beautiful color he had ever seen - this faint shade of red had a mesmerizing glow to it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stayed at her side until she had fallen into a deep sleep. By this time, it was already midnight. He got up slowly without disturbing her and left quietly. Qing Shui felt helpless about his situation; he had to continue his cultivation while satisfying his women while being a hero to many at the same time!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The reason he had decided to relieve himself with Huoyun Liu-Li was because he didn’t have the mood to cultivate his skills. He also felt partly guilty for her as well as the other ladies because he couldn’t devote an entire night to them, much less accompany them past midnight.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he went back to his room, the first thing he did was to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. But when he stepped into the realm, he was stunned by what he saw!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The realm had expanded in size, and was much bigger compared to before. Qing Shui knew exactly what caused this - an upgrade. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had finally upgraded…..</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui roughly estimated that the width and height of the realm had increased by a thousand meters. The sole pond in the middle of the realm had also expanded by a hundred meter or more. In an instant, the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had transformed into an area more spacious by numerous folds.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although he hadn't see the descriptions inscribed on the stone monument, he was certain that the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had experienced an upgrade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He already had a nagging suspicion during his intercourse with Huoyun Liu-Li, especially during the time both of them were experiencing a change inside their bodies. At the same time, Qing Shui felt a surge of spiritual energy inside his body, a familiar sensation that happened every time the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal had been upgraded. He wasn't certain at that point, but then he saw it with his own eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had also gained a moderate amount of spiritual energy during his intercourse with Canghai Mingyue back then. Because of that, he was able to miraculously revive part of his vitals that had been severely damaged.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time, Qing Shui had broken through to the Sixth Level of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He knew he wouldn't have been able to upgrade the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal with Huoyun Liu-Li alone. Canghai Mingyue’s help was also indispensable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He still couldn't figure out the requirement to upgrade the realm after all this time. Initially, he thought that all he needed to do was to have intercourse with women in order to upgrade the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. However, this theory was debunked when the realm experienced an upgrade without him having sex with a woman. But it wasn't completely debunked because a woman was also involved in the breakthrough.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui rubbed his head trying to figure out the exact trigger for the breakthrough. Nevertheless, the realm had upgraded to the next level, so it was a good thing worth celebrating. He then walked towards the stone monument near the pond to see what kind of surprises he would get from the upgrade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Nine-Petal Lotus in the middle of the water seemed significantly smaller as the pond had expanded. The depth of the pond had increased as well. It was deeper than it used to be.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The marine species consisting of fishes, prawns, turtles, and crabs had dispersed around the pond. It was more pleasing to his eyes because it wasn't that cramped anymore.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the stone monument did not change at all in terms of its size! Qing Shui was excited to see what words were inscribed on the stone monument!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">First level, unlocked!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Second level, unlocked!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sixth level, unlocked!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It only felt real when he read those words on the stone monument. He was ecstatic to know that the realm had indeed broken through to the sixth level. Qing Shui was excited to see what kind of rare rewards would come with this upgrade as he continued to the next line.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The first reward was a Five Elements Fruit Tree, which would bear ten fruits once it had ripened every hundred years. Each fruit was able to strengthen the ability of the five elements attributions, allowing the user to cultivate techniques that corresponded to their elements to yield twice the result with half the effort. The Five Elements Fruit would not increase the consumer’s strength, but it could improve the consumer’s bodily constitution and lifeforce. Most importantly, the fruit would be able to purify the consumer’s corresponding element as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s element was Earth. If he were to consume an Earth element fruit, he would be able to increase the purity level of his element. He would discover an unexpected boost in the speed and the strength of his Ancient Strengthening Technique or other Earth elemental techniques once he started his cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Five Elements Fruit Tree, as reflected by its name, had fruits of the five elements, namely Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Each person was only allowed to consume the fruits corresponding to their own elements. If they were to consume fruits other than their element, they would not be able to reap the benefits of the Five Element Fruit. Furthermore, one person could only have one corresponding element.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This is good!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t expect this surprise the reward would bring to him. The Five Elements Fruits were considered rare items in the World of Nine Continents. These fruits were very special and valuable.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Normally, one would only be required to eat one fruit or a number of Five Elements Fruits that would match the five elements of their body. That way, one would be able to proceed with their cultivation using techniques that corresponded to the five elements. In any case, a cultivator would be able to achieve a greater battle skill as long as the techniques have been applied and the techniques used reached a certain level of mastery.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A person was only allowed to eat up to ten Five Elements Fruits that corresponded to their own elements!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then recalled about the Five Elements Heavenly Fruits that were required to break through to the Martial Saint Realm - these fruits were also categorized into five elements. Despite the similarity, Qing Shui could not figure out the relation between the Five Elements Fruits and the Five Elements Heavenly Fruits required for the breakthrough to Martial Saint.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, the Five Elements Fruit may be inferior because one person was allowed to eat ten of them. Because of that, Qing Shui didn’t think the fruits that the Five Elements Tree bore would be on par with the quality of the legendary Five Elements Heavenly Fruits in the World of Nine Continents.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He perished his thoughts and shifted his focus onto the next few rewards!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten 3,000 year Milkvetch!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten 3,000 year Thousand Orchid!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten 3,000 year Blood Jade Ginseng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">…….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was quite pleased with these rewards. He had received fifteen types of 3,000 year herbs, and they were all very decent as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Although these herbs were satisfactory, Qing Shui did not feel as excited as he thought he would be. He felt that these herbs were less than half as exquisite compared to the first reward, the Five Elements Fruit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Qing Shui didn't mind because these 3,000 years herbs would eventually become 4,000 years herbs or medicines of higher quality in no time with the help of his Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Moreover, these herbs were originally grown in abundance in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next reward was a total of 300 Rainbow Trout Fishes - the species that would lay one hundred eggs once in a hundred years. After that, it would take another hundred years for the little fishes to mature. Each fish has the ability to increase one’s energy level by two hundred Jin, as well as strengthening the consumer’s meridians and the vital organs of their body. They would also feel as if their spirit has been cleansed slightly after consuming the fish. Moreover, they would still be able to feel the effects until they had consumed ten Rainbow Trout Fishes in a year, because consuming more than ten fishes a year would not yield any more energy or strengthen the body anymore. In any case, the fish tasted delicious on its own; it could also be used as a component of medicine, and as an ingredient for wine as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was ecstatic. The Rainbow Trout Fish was the evolution of the Gold Horn Firetail Fish, and most importantly, the number of eggs the Rainbow Trout Fish would lay was more impressive than its former form.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Theoretically, even if half of the 300 fishes were male and the other half were female, they would still produce a few million offsprings in two years….. Qing Shui looked back at the large pond and smiled widely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next reward was a ‘Mysterious Fruit Tree’ that would only produce one fruit in every 500 years. After the fruit was consumed, it would have a 1 % chance of giving a random unexpected result. The result would be a random increase in one of the following: strength, defense, or speed; a breakthrough for a random martial art technique; or the comprehension of the five elements profound theory of any cultivation technique.....</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was confused by the Mysterious Fruit Tree and the fruit’s capability. He knew it was a good item, but he was a bit iffy about the concept. The tree would bear one fruit every 500 years, and the fruit would have a 1 % chance of an unexpected reward….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even with the realm’s extraordinary time mechanic, the tree would only bear a fruit once every three years. Without the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he could only stare at the tree and still could not force it to produce a fruit. Moreover, the lifespan of a Xiantian martial warrior was at least 500 years, and the lifespan of a Martial Saint warrior would be around 1,000 years….&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In three years, he thought, he would be able to pick the Mysterious Fruit. At least it was more acceptable than waiting for 500 years. In addition to that, it would be out of this world if he were to hit the jackpot on the 1 % chance of a rare gift.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The next reward was a bee nest consisting of an army of one hundred Jade Emperor Bees. These bees were able to speed up the growth of medicinal herbs by 10 %. Additionally, the Jade Emperor Queen Bee that led her armies of bees would be able to produce ten offsprings once in a hundred year. The matured Jade Emperor Bees would have at least the strength of a Martial King, whereas the Jade Emperor Queen Bee would have the strength of a Peak Martial King. The Jade Emperor Bee had a very long body, yet they were known to be extremely fast and poisonous. Each year, these bees would be able to harvest ten Jin of Jade Emperor Queen Bee Nectar.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jade Emperor Queen Bee Nectar has the ability to enhance the potential of the human body, and strengthen the physique of one's body!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What the fuck!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not help but swear at the sight of the enhancements the nectar could give. Meanwhile, the Martial King level Jade Emperor Bees were buzzing around with the Peak Martial King Jade Emperor Queen Bee in the middle of the hive. He was delighted to know that the bees were exceptionally agile and had a poisonous sting.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The rewards from the Sixth Layer of the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal were truly remarkable. However, the list still went on. So without hesitation, Qing Shui continued looking at the list of rewards calmly. Despite that, he wanted to finish reading the rewards quickly so that he could check the items on the spot….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next reward: 2000 Jin of Violet Jade. A localized material that could be used for forging and refining!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next reward: Ten cinnamon spices, and ten Purple Bamboo Tea!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Next reward: The ratio of time in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal has become 1:200. Time allowed in the realm has been expanded to six hours!</p>
