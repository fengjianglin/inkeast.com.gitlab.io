 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. His eyes hadn’t failed him yet. In the past, he had heard some things about Nalan Ping, and now that he was seeing Nalan Ping for himself, he said, "Give me a reason."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything required a reason. The Nalan Clan and Qing Clan should be on opposing stands. No matter what the reason was, the Nalan Clan should not be coming here. Since he did, then he should have his reasons to do so. It wouldn't be something that could be covered with benevolence. It was also not something that can be explained with his filial piety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I know that someone in the Qing Clan cultivates a type of martial technique that strikes out while borrowing on the opponent's force, as well as negating forces. I have a martial technique in my hands that's similar to it. I can give it to Qing Clan. Will this do? Other than this, I really don't have anything else." Nalan Ping gave it some thoughts and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That secret manual was something that was the most precious to him, after his mother. It was also because of this secret manual that he could secure a little status in the Nalan Clan and was able to stay for a few more years in the Nalan Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very interested in his talent. He shook his head, "I can help you, but there's no need for the secret manual. You can stay. What I value more is your filial piety. Otherwise, I would never have agreed to this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui nodded and smiled at that amiable looking lady, "I don't know how to address you. Since you're here, there's no need to stand on ceremony. The people in the Qing Clan are easy to get along with. You'll find out after staying for some time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Miraculous Physician Qing, I've received help from the Imperial Cuisine Hall before. Ping`er is no longer a member of the Nalan Clan. We don't have any relations at all with the Nalan Clan." The madam smiled and bowed slightly to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she was smiling, there was a faint grieve in her smile. This faint sorrow was very clear, as if it was something that would never be dissolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't feel anything about Nalan Ping staying. The matters here were already settled and as for what was going to happen to the Nalan Clan, it was none of his business. He was not such a nice person to feel aggrieved over the death of the people of the Nalan Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui then continued to help his children strengthen their foundation and increase their cultivation. Qing Clan had their own specialized kitchen and tend to make things themselves. It was the same for Nalan Ping and his mother. Very soon, both Nalan Ping and his mother had gotten accustomed to this place. There were no attendants here with the exception of guards. There were many supplies in the kitchen and they could cook whatever they wanted to eat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Qing Clan had taken in a family who would take turns to keep on guard. Occasionally, they would also cook in the kitchen in cases when they didn't have enough help around or when there were visitors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One week passed by very quickly. Although Nalan Ping and his mother weren't able to fully be a part of the Qing Clan, they were already very natural around them. Nalan Ping was a person who was very accepting, and his mother was also someone who could take things in her stride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't worried that Nalan Ping would bring harm to the Qing Clan. He knew that Nalan Ping wouldn't do that, as his mother was here. Moreover, he didn't have the ability to do so. Otherwise, Qing Shui wouldn't have taken him in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nalan Clan had dissolved and no one knew of the injuries and deaths involved. It was very hard to see people from the Nalan Clan now. Nalan Xinghai had died, and Qing Shui wasn't surprised when he heard this piece of news. All of these were within his expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Phoenix Dance Amalgamation appeared once again. However, they had also been dealt a great blow from before. The moment they got back together, they paid a visit to the Qing Clan. However, Qing Shui had already made himself clear that the Qing Clan would not be a part of any influences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This announcement was very satisfactory and the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation would not feel that they had been humiliated. Since they indicated that they wished to keep a low profile, it made it clear that they didn't want to get involved with any influences. However, with how strong they were, one should still not offend them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianhe Renmo had come by once and Qing Shui had played a great host. Tianhe Renmo was also a False God now, but he had only passed through three False God divine tribulations. This was already considered to be fast. Each False God divine tribulation was more dangerous than the one before, and now, in the Tianhe Clan, Tianhe Renmo had been practically made to be the one to take over the clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had saved Tianhe Renmo before. The latter was clear in his distinction of friends and foes, being one who would return a favor in multiple folds. Therefore, he had treated Qing Shui with great sincerity and not hypocrisy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They got along quite well and although could not be considered to be people who would risk their lives for each other, they were still quite close. It wasn't as if a person who was weaker would be of no help to you. In ancient times, there was the saying of having friends from high ranking officials to normal citizens and soldiers. This meant that the person had a great network of friends and every single friend would be able to help you. No matter how low the status of a person was, he would be able to save another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days later, Qing Shui headed to the Demon Lord Palace. He had it all planned out. The more he got closer to the Demon Lord Palace, the more nervous he felt. He wanted to meet Tantai Lingyan yet was afraid to meet the lady with an unrivaled beauty who had once kept him far at bay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui arrived at the Demon Lord Palace, he was stopped. The guards seemed to not recognize Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is the Demon Lord Palace! Outsiders are barred from entering!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who spoke was a middle-aged man with mediocre abilities. However, he was very strict as this was the Demon Lord Palace. Qing Shui said helplessly, "Please go in and pass the message that Qing Shui is here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wait here!" The man could tell that Qing Shui wasn't here to create trouble. No one would dare to come to the Demon Lord Palace just for fun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, a figure came out and when the person saw Qing Shui, he smiled, "Younger Brother, it's really you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw Zhan Yu, he smiled, "Elder Brother, why have you come?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Since you've come, how could I not come to welcome you? Your elder sister is preparing food and had also gone to inform the Palace Lord." Zhan Yu came up to give Qing Shui a hug and gave him a strong pat on the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui also returned the hug. The two of them had a very close relationship due to Hua Rumei and the Demon Lord. Hua Rumei and the Demon Lord were close as sisters and Zhan Yu was Hua Rumei's husband. Moreover, Qing Shui and Zhan Yu got along very well together and had even fought together before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they arrived at Hua Rumei's place, she was already walking out of it. When she saw Qing Shui, she revealed a happy smile, appearing very charming. She came over and gave Qing Shui a hug, "You seem to still remember this lady!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course! You're my elder sister!" Qing Shui said and looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Rumei smiled, "What are you looking for?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Rumei knew all too well but still popped this question. She knew that Qing Shui was looking for Tantai Lingyan and that Qing Shui's thoughts were more on Tantai Lingyan. This was very natural. It would be abnormal if this wasn't the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Tantai Lingyan walked out, and her gaze met Qing Shui's. She was still the cool beauty she had been, but seemed to have slim down a little. However, she didn't give off the feeling of being feeble and weak. She still looked beautiful as ever, but just with more feminine charms. Furthermore, it seemed as if she wasn't as forceful and headstrong as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feeling of headstrong was an aura, and this seemed to have disappeared. Qing Shui knew that it was better for it to be gone. It was because Tantai Lingyan had attained a breakthrough from the level she was at before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her hair was tied high up, and her beautiful brows seemed very soft and relaxed. Her beautiful face had no makeup on, yet had the rosy glow as if the morning sun was reflected against white snow. She had the beauty of a goddess and a beautiful figure. Her snow-white plain clothes couldn't hide her curves. Her shoulders were sharp like blades and the arch before her chest was breathtaking. Her waist seemed to be smooth as silk and her slender figure was beautiful like a great jade carving masterpiece...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn't smile as her pair of beautiful eyes exuded a disposition as if she was an existence that wasn't to be tainted. It was still hard to get close to her, but it wasn't because she was cold. It was from the arrogance that came from her very soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had never been able to see through her. He didn't sense any changes in her nor felt that she had gotten closer to him, despite the fact that some wonderful things had happened to them in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui would never be able to forget the moment when he put on the ring for her back in the Ancient Ruins. It was one part of the Goddess Divine Set. That moment was when Qing Shui felt that he was the closest to Tantai Lingyan, but now, he had no idea if the same feeling still exists between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His feelings were still present, but he wasn't sure if it was the case for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You've come." Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. He nodded, feeling very happy that Tantai Lingyan had taken the initiative to speak to him, "Lingyan, have you been well?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Rumei wore a smile and pulled Zhan Yu with her to the kitchen. The kitchen was a distance away. After all, this was the hall and they intentionally left the place for Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Tantai Lingyan heard the way Qing Shui addressed her, she still felt a little uncomfortable. There was one point if time when she had gotten used to it, but as time passed, it was as they had grown more distant. However, that feeling seemed to be recovering bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui saw the ring that was on Tantai Lingyan's finger. It was the part of the Goddess Divine Set which he had put on for her back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan noticed that Qing Shui's gaze had landed on her hand and she also thought of the things that had happened between them in the past. She wore a faint smile and said, "I've been well. How about you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had seen her smiled twice, and the scene was even more breathtaking than seeing a field of flowers in full bloom. Right now, seeing that her smile was still as breathtaking as ever, he said, smiling bitterly, "I haven't been well, actually!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan had expected Qing Shui to reply politely to say that he was fine and hadn't expected this. She gave it some thought before asking, "Why? Did something happened?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No, it's just that I'll often think about you yet was unable to see you." Qing Shui plucked up his courage and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui excelled in reaching for a yard after being given an inch, striking the iron while it was still hot. When he saw that Tantai Lingyan wasn't as cool as before, he felt that he still meant something to her. Therefore, he knew that he mustn't be too reserved and that he needed to let her know that his feelings hadn't changed. He wanted to show her, letting her know that his feelings hadn't changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan didn't fly into anger but lowered her head slightly. She paused for a while before lifting up her head, "You haven't changed. I miss you too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned and only regained his composure after very long. He hadn't expected that she would say that she missed him. He knew that what Tantai Lingyan meant was definitely not the same as what he had meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm starting to suspect if I'm hallucinating. You really missed me?" Qing Shui took two steps forward, leaving only a step worth of distance between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're my friend, and I don't have many friends. It's very normal for me to miss you. I'm a human as well and as time passes, I'll also wish to see you." Tantai Lingyan said very calmly, wearing a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a cool character and if she didn't wish to smile, she wouldn't. If she were to wear a smile, it meant that she was really happy. She wouldn't force herself to smile and thus, when Qing Shui saw her smile, he felt very warm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that he was a little impatient, and said, smiling, "I now suddenly feel very good. After seeing you, I believe that it was very good in the past as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"When did you come back?" Tantai Lingyan pointed to a seat while she herself sat down as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sat opposite to her and their distance was very close. Her exquisite and perfect face didn't have a hint of flaw on it. Her clear and cold eyes made Qing Shui felt ashamed as if he had tainted her just by meeting her gaze. The feeling was very intense.</span></p>
