 <p><strong>AST 1204 - Crippled, wedding, Seeing another wedding arena</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui recognized the Eldest Princess’s voice, but he didn’t see her in person. He didn’t know why Eldest Princess had stepped in, but he assumed that it had to do with the Seventh Princess.</p>
 <p>When the old man called Uncle Li heard what the Eldest Princess said, his body trembled. He then extended his trembling hand towards Mu Chaoye’s Qihai Acupoint, where his Dantian was located at.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Li, don’t… You can’t cripple me…”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish his sentence, the old man had already poked downwards. After a short yet painful cry, Mu Chaoye immediately fainted. When that happened, he must have felt completely disheartened.</p>
 <p>The most important thing to a warrior wasn’t their life. It wasn’t that their life wasn’t important but the most important thing to warriors was their cultivation, especially for someone who has reached this level. Only by having high cultivation would one be able to live long. But when someone suddenly lost his cultivation and became a crippled person, it was very likely that he would die immediately. Even his heart wouldn’t be able to take it.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess of the Great Yu Dynasty was definitely a legendary character. On the surface, she was the Eldest Princess from the Great Yu Dynasty and also the youngest teacher in the Heaven Secrets Academy. It was also said that she had a very, very strong backing behind her.</p>
 <p>The old man did not doubt the Eldest Princess’ words. Since he was already unable to protect Mu Chaoye today, he felt that he shouldn’t sacrifice himself pointlessly. He only hoped that he would be alright when he went back to the Mu Clan. He still held some status within the Mu Clan. Hence, he wasn’t sure if he would be able to continue living peacefully. In any case, Mu Chaoye was still the grandson of the Mu Clan’s Clan’s Head, even though he was a good-for-nothing, he still had a bit of talent.</p>
 <p>Let’s talk after we settled the problem at hand!</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” The old man carried Mu Chaoye and left with the others from the Mu Clan.</p>
 <p>They never expected the Eldest Princess to appear. If she didn’t show up, the incident today would definitely not have ended up this way. If he had confronted her just now, it was very likely that he, Mu Chaoye and the others would have all died here.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also didn’t know why Eldest Princess showed up. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to defeat Uncle Li. Even with his Seal of Roc currently at Small Success Stage, he still wasn’t confident in beating him.</p>
 <p>Even when he was leaving, Uncle Li still didn’t know why the Eldest Princess had showed up to protect Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Many people below were looking at Qing Shui enviously. They wished the person in mid-air to be themselves. To think that the Eldest Princess would stand up for him. From now on, no one would dare to ever provoke him in the Great Yu Dynasty, at least they wouldn’t do it outwardly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still holding the corpse of the Snow Jade Poisonous Jiao in his hand. Even he himself didn’t know how he ended up holding it. He conveniently threw it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. The skin of the Snow Jade Poisonous Jiao was decent and could be used to forge armor. Its bones could also be forging materials while its blood essence could be used in medicine making. Overall the corpse of the Snow Jade Poisonous Jiao could be said to be very precious.</p>
 <p>“Serves the people from the Mu Clan right for acting so savagely here!”</p>
 <p>“Exactly, do they really think that they are invincible? They didn’t even put the people from royal family in their eyes. Sooner or later, they will be eliminated.”</p>
 <p>“No matter how huge a clan is, they would still be afraid of wastrels!”</p>
 <p>“It’s still the royal family that has a rich background. The Eldest Princess truly is the legendary royal fairy. This is what you call deterrence.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was listening to the surrounding comments while walking with the little girl and a few others towards a living room.</p>
 <p>There was already a woman inside the room. She was exceptionally enchantin. She had a slender body and the loose clothing she wore could not conceal the curves on her body. Even though it wasn’t some exaggeratedly curved body, people would still find it tough to look away. The undulations of her peaks were graceful beyond compare.</p>
 <p>Not only were the curves of her breasts, waist and butt perfect, every part of her body was extremely alluring. Her beautiful hair was tied up, revealing her slender, white neck. Her beautiful neck and perfect figure gave off an enchanting luster.</p>
 <p>Her face alone already gave off all of the charm in the human world. The pair of brilliant pupils of hers gave off the feeling of a very wise and farsighted woman. They were so pretty that it could make someone stop just to look at them.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess!</p>
 <p>At first, Qing Shui was a bit distracted. However, he managed to return to normal very quickly. Furthermore, from her aura and her appearance, he could already confirm that she was the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>“I thank the Eldest Princess for helping me once again.” Qing Shui’s expression was really calm. Even Qing Shui himself didn’t know how he felt when he saw the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>There seemed to be a constant faint smile on the Eldest Princess’s face, yet it also didn’t seem like it. She was openly looking at Qing Shui seeming very interested in him.</p>
 <p>“You are friends with them. Don’t worry about it. I would also like to thank you for helping them.” the Eldest Princess spoke very softly. There was an unusual beauty to it. Her attractive voice was a little hoarse and seemed to pull in one’s soul when listening to it.</p>
 <p>This was a woman who could enchant people with just her voice. Compared to Di Chen, Canghai Mingyue and Yiye Jiange, she wasn’t the slightest inferior to them.</p>
 <p>At the very least, this woman wasn’t inferior to the women on the Portraits of Beauty.</p>
 <p>The twelve Portraits of Beauty, Qing Shui once again felt that it might be talking about women with twelve types of mysterious bone structures. The only thing Qing Shui could comment on at the moment was that the Eldest Princess wasn’t at all inferior to the women in the Portraits of Beauty. But compared to Yan Jinyu and the Seventh Princess, she seemed to have the upper hand in terms of charm.</p>
 <p>As everyone sat together, Qing Shui noticed that the people from the Yan Clan were very reserved. Even Yan Jinyu was acting that way. Only the Seventh Princess looked slightly more natural. It seemed like they very rarely saw the Eldest Princess.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, I still need to thank the Eldest Princess for helping me enter Heaven Secrets Academy.” They were all sitting together drinking tea instead of wine, yet the atmosphere felt very tense.</p>
 <p>Despite Yan Yangchi’s efforts in trying to make the atmosphere more relaxed, it didn’t seem to be working out.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess’s aura was too strong and was a concealed suppressive feeling.</p>
 <p>“Mister has truly shocked me. Not only in martial arts and forging, but it seems that you have great accomplishments in drawing as well.” Eldest Princess looked and smiled at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“You can call me Qing Shui. Eldest Princess, how did you find out that I can draw?” Qing Shui asked casually. No matter what, this woman had helped him. In the future, he might still need more of her help, at least during this period of time.</p>
 <p>“I saw your wife’s portrait. If I’m not mistaken, you drew that.” The Eldest Princess said with great interest.</p>
 <p>“Why would you think that way?” Qing Shui was a bit confused.</p>
 <p>“I have some foundation in drawing. If that drawing is the portrait of your wife, it definitely must have been drawn by you. This is because that was a drawing which couldn’t be drawn with just artistic skills alone. Without a deep-rooted love that is unchanging till death, the artist wouldn’t have been able to draw it. Am I wrong?” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p>In between, she also gazed at the Seventh Princess.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t say anything but the others were able to tell that the Eldest Princess had guessed correctly. However, they only noticed now that Qing Shui was very good at drawing. This was because they had all seen Di Chen’s portrait. They didn’t ask who drew it because they never expected Qing Shui to be the artist.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know what Eldest Princess meant and simply smiled at her. The heart of Seventh Princess, on the other hand, was thumping up and down all this time. This was a very strange feeling.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Two days passed really quickly and it was already Yan Yangchi’s wedding day. The whole place was decorated with lanterns and colored banners. When it was around 8 in the morning, the wedding started.</p>
 <p>Quite a lot of people from the royal family showed up. The Eldest Princess was also here. Many people who were rarely seen on ordinary days could be seen, making the Yan Clan seem more glorious than before.</p>
 <p>The Old Ancestors from the Yan Clan also showed up. At the banquet, every guest held an honorable status. After all, the people they were associated with at their level would definitely not be ordinary.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a matter of whether they looked down on ordinary people. They had already lived for hundreds of years. How long would normal people live? Even if they had such friends in the past, most of them would have passed away by now.</p>
 <p>Birds of a feather flock together. Similarly, people who are alike would also divide themselves into factions.</p>
 <p>Although it was a flourishing scene, many people were still worried. They were worried that people from the Scarlet Flame Region would show up. Qing Shui was also thinking about this problem. He wondered if the Eldest Princess had been able to stop them with her words.</p>
 <p>Roughly two hours later, the wedding arena started. Qing Shui never expected that there would also be such a thing here. Continents with flourishing martial arts were like this, hence it wasn’t really all that weird.</p>
 <p>Marrying the princess, the royal family would be the first to guard the arena!</p>
 <p>This was also a symbolic competition. If the royal family really wanted to resolutely defend it, the princess would truly be unable to be married.</p>
 <p>One of the youths from the royal family walked up the arena and cupped his fist to the spectators, “Today, I will be fighting the first round. Youngsters from the Yan Clan, whether you would be able to marry the princess today depends on how hard you guys are willing to work for it!”</p>
 <p>The teenager looked very cheerful. He was quite young and had a slender and tall body. He wasn’t very strong. Qing Shui smiled and watched. He knew that the Eldest Princess had appeared merely for formality.</p>
 <p>Yan Clan also sent out a youth. His strength was similar to the youth from the royal family. They were all comparing their techniques. The battle was in full swing, with most of it being a performance. In the end, the fight was concluded as a draw.</p>
 <p>After that, both the Yan Clan and the royal family once again sent out their disciples, with each following disciple being stronger than the last. Even though it was mostly putting on a show, they still displayed their strength and fought brilliantly.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After Yan Yangchen defeated one of the royal family disciples, the duels were considered to have ended as there was not much time left. As Yan Yangchen cupped his fist in all directions and was about to descend, a figure suddenly appeared on the arena.</p>
 <p>“I am wondering if I can fight on the wedding arena? If I win, does it mean that I will be able to marry the princess?” A lazy voice was heard.</p>
 <p>The person who appeared on the arena was a man who looked young, He was very handsome yet nefarious and had a lazy smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Impudent! Who are you, we don’t welcome you here!” Yan Yangchen shouted annoyedly at the man.</p>
 <p>“It’s a happy occasion, everyone is here to join in the fun. Did you set up the arena just for show? Could it be that you people from the Yan Clan feel that you aren’t able to defend the arena?” The man said carefreely.</p>
 <p>“Then I will kick you out now!” Yan Yangchen shouted loudly and charged towards the man.</p>
 <p>The man remained silent. He only extended his hand and casually struck out when the enormous fist in the air was about to hit his body. However, he landed his blow first, immediately striking Yan Yangchen’s chest.</p>
 <p>It might have seemed like a casual attack but Yan Yangchen was blown away and even spit out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>The sudden unforeseen event caused the situation to become passive. Everyone was astonished and there were some people who had a schadenfreude expression but even more people were indulging in the bustling scene.</p>
 <p>“Too weak, could it be that other than the Eldest Princess, no one else can defeat me?” The man on the arena smiled as he mocked.</p>
 <p>“Allow me!”</p>
 <p>Yan Leng charged onto the arena. He was very fast and was holding the weapon that Qing Shui had forged for him. He was also wearing the armor and boots that Qing Shui had forged!</p>
