 <p><strong>AST 786 - Return Journey, Earth Dragon Beast</strong></p>
 <p>The journey on the way here was considered peaceful and at least for now, the journey on the way back was still peaceful. However, what was awaiting him next was the heart of the barren land which ran for tens of millions of li. It was also the most dangerous spot of this journey.</p>
 <p>On his way here, he had dodged a few large-scaled flying demonic beasts and now that he was heading back, Qing Shui's cultivation level had gotten an increase. However, it was still insufficient for him to be able to go up against those demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>The Fire Bird flew low in the valley as countless black spots there were densely packed and flying in their direction. Qing Shui knew that they were not something which he could go up against.</p>
 <p>The valley was very deep. After all, the it was between two tall mountains that had reached up to the clouds. The plant vegetation in the mountains were very messy, filling up the place. There were even a layer of grass and vines, many of which were covered with sharp thorns, on the mountain rocks.</p>
 <p>The air smelled of a humid grass scent but it was a nice scent. Qing Shui looked up to see the countless black-colored flying demonic beasts. There were really too many of these ferocious demonic beasts in nature here.</p>
 <p>Such barren land was very common across the world of the nine continents and there were also some which were located out of the world of the nine continents, such as the west of the Greencloud Continent, the back of the Westeria Continent, the immense Eastern Sea region to the east of the Eastern Victory Divine Continent, as well as the boundless Southern Sea to the south of the Southern Viewing Continent.</p>
 <p>These were all unknown territories and no one knew how dangerous these places were. After all, no one could even find out how deep the waters in the world of the nine continents were, let alone checking out those unknown regions.</p>
 <p>Black Feather Roc!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tensed up as he looked at the flock of Black Feather Rocs which had covered up a large stretch of the skies. Before such large scaled demonic beasts, a human's power was very, very small. All along, it has always been humans who were battling against the demonic beasts in the world of the nine continents. Where there was people, there were generally no demonic beasts which were exceptionally powerful and the barren land would be the world of the demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>The Black Feather Roc was a kind of roc-typed demonic beast. It was about fifty meters in size, its body pitch black like ink. It could absorb sunlight to strengthen its cultivation and its attack contained a fire-attributed poison.</p>
 <p>If it was just one of them, it would be nothing to Qing Shui. But with such a tremendous number of them, there would be no end to them even if he were to start to kill them, Cang Wuya and the others were no match for the Black Feather Rocs.</p>
 <p>Ning ning!</p>
 <p>Countless sharp cries filled up the sky. Ordinary people would not be able to withstand those cries. After the time taken for half an incense to burn had passed, they flew off. Qing Shui had wanted to knock a few of them down as he didn't like how arrogant they were appearing to be but he didn't do it. It might potentially infuriate them and bringing out their violent side. If all of them dashed down to him without a care, it would not be good for him either.</p>
 <p>The flock of Black Feather Rocs flew off and after taking a look at the surroundings, Qing Shui then continued flying in the direction of the Greencloud Continent on the Fire Bird, together with Cang Wuya and the others. When they came across small-sized demonic beast groups, they would simply charge through. The Fire Bird was also considerably strong.</p>
 <p>Prrrrttt!</p>
 <p>Suddenly a soul throbbing cry rang out in the valleys before them. Just from its cry alone, Qing Zun knew that this was a Peak Martial Saint demonic beast. There was then a deep knocking sound, followed by the cry of another demonic beast.</p>
 <p>It sounded like two demonic beasts of the same kind were fighting each other.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui hesitated. He didn't know if he should fly past them. He didn't wish to get involved with such powerful demonic beasts, even if he'd be able to get his hands on some good stuff after killing.</p>
 <p>Just as he was about to fly past them, two huge yellow demonic beasts dashed out from the valley. Qing Shui realized that they were actually two huge Earth Dragon Beasts.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had seen Earth Dragon Beasts that were like them, ahead of their packs. Now that two of them were fighting with each other, it was clear that they were fighting to be the leaders of their packs. This was a battle to the death. There can only be one leader.</p>
 <p>The two Earth Dragon Beast were about a hundred meters, with a yellow-orangey color that shone under sunlight. The had huge heads and extremely power bodies. The Earth Dragon Beast were of the earth elements and were also known as Earth Dragon Beast. Their greatest trait were their powerful defences and when battling on the ground, their battle prowess would be two times as strong. But why would they fight in the air? With their big bodies, although they still appeared to be a little agile in the air, it was just barely so.</p>
 <p>Now, both of them were covered in blood. This was a unique way of battling between Peak Martial Saints...relying only on purely physical strength.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they were battling in the air. Since both of them were Earth Dragon Beasts, it was still considered fair. The level of these two Earth Dragon Beasts were about at three stars and was considered the weaker beasts amongst Martial Saint level beasts.</p>
 <p>If it was in the air, even the Fire Bird would be able to take one of them alone and would definitely be able to kill it. Qing Shui didn't plan on letting go of the unexpected fortune.</p>
 <p>He must finish it in the air. If they were on land, there would not just be a large group of Earth Dragon Beasts but their abilities would also multiply. He didn't have the time to delay either, since the Earth Dragon Beasts on the ground might also dash up while these two escape toward the ground.</p>
 <p>Another thing that Qing Shui had the advantage over was that both of these Earth Dragon Beasts were injured and heavily injured at that. Qing Shui's mind quickly turned and he let the Fire Bird stay here.</p>
 <p>Cloudmist Steps!</p>
 <p>He called out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and with a Mighty Elephant Stomp, stomped toward the other two.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he also called out for the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike unleashed!</p>
 <p>The Fiery Golden Eyes and Emperor's Qi had also reached them before the Mighty Elephant Stomp did. It was because it took a little time to activate the Mighty Elephant Stomp. This little time was enough for Qing Shui do complete the other actions.</p>
 <p>The two Earth Dragon Beasts noticed Qing Shui very quickly. However, one of them was hit by the Violet Lightning Strike and was unable to move. Although the other was not hit, it was weakened by Qing Shui to be left with only slight above two stars worth of strength.</p>
 <p>A pitch black flame wave that had the darkness of dark clouds and yet was terrifying like a hurricane in deep abyss spread out toward the two Earth Dragon Beast. It was the Mighty Elephant Stomp.</p>
 <p>When the Earth Dragon Beast which had not been struck by the Violet Lightning Strike saw the terrifying Mighty Elephant Stomp, it quickly headed for the ground. After giving it some thought, Qing Shui chose not to pursue. Just then a loud explosive sound rang out.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then followed to see the Earth Dragon Beast's corpse which was a horrible sight. The huge explosion had smashed the Earth Dragon Beast's body into pieces, leaving only the Core intact. Qing Shui was thankful for that. If it was any other demonic beast, there would be probably nothing left of it. The Mighty Elephant Stomp had the power of seven stars...</p>
 <p>Initially, he had wanted to use the Earth Dragon Beast's corpse for refining demon. The chances of getting Essence Pill from Peak Martial Saint demonic beasts were higher. But now, he could only get a Core and some hide.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui kept the Core and hide and quickly left on the Fire Bird. The stench of blood was already spreading out and very quickly, other demonic beasts would be attracted over. It was not a safe place to stay.</p>
 <p>Although the journey was boring, most of the time was spent in the air. However, at night, he would still look for a place to stop for a rest. One reason was for Qing Shui to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal for his cultivation and another reason was for safety. Demonic beasts who appeared at night tended to be bloodthirsty and vicious.</p>
 <p>There were many times when he had to dodge from danger and there was also one time when he was surrounded by the demonic beasts and had to forcefully fight his way out. There was also a time where he was pursued for quite a while by a group of demonic beasts. Those were Green Ants and were only about one foot in size. However, they were extremely venomous and their flying speed were very fast. He had only managed to shake them off after a very long while.</p>
 <p>Greencloud Continent was within reach and Qing Shui was extremely agitated. Although he was nearing Greencloud City, it would still need to take many days. However, he could now stay in inns.</p>
 <p>Back in the Greencloud Continent, Qing Shui felt that the place was very endearing. Although the weather was very different from that in the Southern Viewing Continent, Greencloud Continent was where he grew up in and where his family and friends were. They said that one would feel lonely when in a new place as there would be no familiar people and people one cared for.</p>
 <p>If his family and friends were all in Southern Viewing Continent, in Southern Sea City, Qing Shui would also feel that the place was very good. It was just like now, Hundred Miles City was not as endearing as Greencloud City.</p>
 <p>The population in the world of the nine continents changed very quickly and the flow was large. These people tended to be those who were developing. Those leaders of an area and clans who were deeply rooted to a place would not move easily. It was because the place was their base, just like how for a huge tree, if its roots were moved, there would be a large possibility that the tree would die.</p>
 <p>Qing Village now felt very far away. He should consider if they should go back to spend the new year. Qing Shui remember that his grandfather had always missed Qing Village and decided to return once every few years.</p>
 <p>Happiness Inn！</p>
 <p>This was a higher end inn in Chu Central City. This was Qing Shui's first visit to Chu Central City. In fact, Qing Shui can't even remember all 81 countries in Greencloud City, let alone the 81 cities in each country.</p>
 <p>He felt that there was no need to remember them, as there would be people who would do so. Some coachmen who would travel long distances would be willing to bring you there if you spend some money. Another alternative was to spend money to let them tell you how long the journey was and to travel by yourself, asking for more directions when nearer to the destination.</p>
 <p>"Do you guys know that there's been many things happening at the Continent's Capital recently?"</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui was having a drink at the Happiness Inn, he could not help but listen to what other people were talking about. Now, the biggest players in Continent's Capital were Heavenly Palace and Qing Clan. If there were any major events there, they would probably be after Heavenly Palace or Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked toward the person who spoke. It was a man about 35 to 36 years old. He was wearing a grey long-sleeved top, was thin and tall, had bright eyes and gave one the feeling that he was intelligent.</p>
 <p>"Of course many things have been happening. It's the same for this place right? Three days ago, the boar my third aunt was keeping had given birth..."</p>
 <p>"F*ck off, I'm referring to big events, not insignificant things like yours." The man from earlier interrupted before the second person finished.</p>
 <p>"3rd Brother Wu has some new?" Another middle-aged man smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Xiang, this time around, I've received the latest news." The intelligent looking man smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Aren't you just trying to get yourself a drink? Just say it, I'll pay for the drinks you order today." The middle-aged man smiled and replied.</p>
 <p>"Alright! Two bottles of Mantura Fragrance!" The intelligent-looking man smiled and snapped his fingers before saying to the waiter.</p>
 <p>"You can share it now, right?"</p>
 <p>"Alright, I'll speak. You know Heavenly Palace?" The man smiled and asked.</p>
 <p>"Of course! Which cultivator in Greencloud Continent doesn't?" The middle-age man said.</p>
 <p>"Heavenly Palace might be in trouble soon."</p>
