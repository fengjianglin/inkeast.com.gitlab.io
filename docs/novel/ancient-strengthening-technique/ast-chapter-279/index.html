  <p><strong>AST 279 - Joining the Heavenly Palace, Majestic and Independent, Beauties that can topple Empires!</strong></p>
  <p><span style>This bunch of old freaks were all resoundingly famous, and were existences as ‘immovable’ as mountains. However, sadly the longer one lives, the lonelier one would usually be.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, this bunch of old freaks stuck together, and had at least several hundred years of friendship. They were even closer than brothers. The Heavenly Palace was their home, and their descendants were all located there.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After hearing the words Elder Fei mentioned regarding the Supreme Elder, Qing Shui naturally thought of this, it seems like that bunch of old freaks no longer bother themselves with the running of the Heavenly Palace. But despite so, Qing Shui clearly understood that for the Heavenly Palace to have the reputation and prestige it has today, was all because of the support of these powerful old freaks.</span></p>
  <p><span style>In the entire central region of the Greencloud Continent, there were many powerful sects and clans. However, never has a Martial Saint-level cultivator appeared before. The most powerful cultivators were all only at the peak of the Martial King Realm and thus the power levels of the various sects and clans could be measured by the numbers of Peak Martial Kings they had.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were also newly established sects that had several prominent and outstanding talents. However, the distance between them and a sect with over 10,000 years of history like the Heavenly Palace, was still too far.</span></p>
  <p><span style>For those peak-level Martial Kings of the reclusive and ancient sects and clans, because of their amount of resources and roots connections, they would undoubtedly be able to defeat the peak-level Martial Kings existences of those newly established sects.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Heavenly Palace itself was extremely famous for their attacks, and refinement, as well as the godly defensive technique, Divinity Protection. The Heavenly Thunder Slash although it wasn’t a legendary realm technique, it’s power was so astonishing that many craved to learn it. Not to mention the fact that with so many years of establishment, there should be other legendary realm ultimate techniques taught only to the strongest disciples within the Heavenly Palace.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui saw Elder Fei walking to the inconspicuous building, as Elder Fei lightly called out. “Master.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stood there stunned. The master of Elder Fei should be at least at the Supreme Elder level right? He then stood at the side of Elder Fei in silence, feeling the heaviness of the atmosphere. Only after entering the Heavenly Palace did Qing Shui realise how heavy the atmosphere felt. Those existences here were all at the peak of cultivation in this continent.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Creak.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The door opened, Qing Shui raised his head as he saw an old man, with a long flowing white beard, and radiant cheeks. His kind eyes was filled with peace, as a gentle smile appeared on his face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Master!” Fei Wuji respectfully bowed as he greeted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wuji, why are you so free to visit this old man today?” The old man’s voice was crisp and clear, filled with vitality.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After speaking, the old man glanced at Qing Shui. Even before Fei Wuji said anything, the old man’s attention instantly fixated on Qing Shui’s bosm area as his figure flickered, disappearing before instantly appearing in front of Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The moment the old man moved, Qing Shui understood that that was the Cloudmist Steps of the Heavenly Palace. He had seen Canghai execute this many times before, and at the instant the old man disappeared, Qing Shui swiftly tried to dodge.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Although it could be considered that his dodge was successful, he felt something touching him. When Qing Shui looked towards the old man, he only saw the Heavenly Token that Canghai had given to him was in the hands of the old man.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The eyes of the old man brimmed with wetness as he gazed at the token, tears after tears started to roll down his face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I, Canghai, from today onwards have no relations with the Heavenly Palace. I will bear the consequences for my own actions.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Let me reiterate again, from today onwards, I, Canghai, am no longer a member of the Heavenly Palace.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Master… Canghai has thrown all the face of your esteemed self away….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Canghai, you are my, Cang Wuya’s disciple. No matter what you have done, I as your master, will bear the debts of your actions for you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Canghai, I’ve tried my best, but this useless master of yours is still unable to keep you in the Heavenly Palace. As your master, yet I’m unable even to help the slightest, I’m truly useless.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The old man’s tears wet the token as he recalled all the previous interactions between him and Canghai. Fei Wuji stared, dumbstruck while Qing Shui currently was regretting that he had not placed the token in his spatial realm for safekeeping.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Canghai, live well after you leave here. Don’t worry, no one will take any further action against you. Your master is a loner with no family, if they dare touch you I shall sacrifice my useless life and make them experience hell on earth.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Canghai, let this token serves as a form of remembrance. I truly don’t know when would us, master and disciple, ever meet again.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The old man’s hands trembled as he held the token, his body shuddering as tears continued streaming down his face.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Master, your disciple hopes that you can grant me a request.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If in the future someone brings this token to the Heavenly Palace, please take care of them for me. They are my descendants, and if they really do come with this token in their hands, this means that I no longer have the ability to protect them..”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Master, your unfilial disciple is leaving….”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Inclining his head, the old man glanced at Qing Shui, while breathing heavily. “How is Canghai now?” Despite everything, he hoped against hope that Canghai was still alive.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He is no longer in this world.” Qing Shui sighed, he finally understood how close the relationship between Canghai and this old man was, only then did he heave a sigh of relief.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Master, senior brother he….” Fei Wuji’s eyes were also brimming with wetness as he glanced at the old man before looking at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“How did he die?” The old man inquired.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“He perished together with the old blindee from the Immortal Sword Sect.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The old blindee which he blinded 30 years ago?” The old man exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Child, are you the son of Canghai?” The old man asked again</span></p>
  <p><span style>“No, I’m not.” Canghai bitterly smiled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The sharp gaze of the old man locked on to Qing Shui, before he lightly spoke, “Did Canghai not have any descendants?” </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at the old man with trepidation in his eyes, worried that something bad might happen. Upon seeing the trepidation on Qing Shui’s face, with his years of experience, the old man instantly deduced what Qing Shui was thinking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I’m Canghai’s master. 30 years ago he did something of such huge proportions that there was no way to close it off. I did my best, giving him a path of life, but he was unable to stay within the Heavenly Palace. Before he left, I gave him the token to serve as remembrance while he made me promise to grant a request of him. He said if in the future someone were to bear this token and look for me, the person would be his descendant and he would have already died...”</span></p>
  <p><span style>So it was as such, although Qing Shui didn’t spend a great deal of time with Canghai, he knew that Canghai’s personality wouldn’t allow him to seek help from the Heavenly Palace unless he was in truly dire straits with no more paths available to him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Senior Canghai has a daughter.” Qing Shui decided to tell the truth, as there was no need to hide it any longer.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“A daughter, a daughter! Good, he has a successor.” A smile finally appeared on the old man’s countenance.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“She knows a little of the Heavenly Palace’s techniques and she just made her way to the Misty Hall.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>No wonder I felt the lady I met earlier was so familiar, so it was because she was the daughter of my senior brother. Senior brother you can rest in peace, your daughter has arrived safely and has met master.” Fei Wuji gazed at the heavens as he mumbled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You must be the husband that Canghai chosen for his daughter.” The eyes of the old man glowed as he stared at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui could only smile awkwardly in response, no longer doubting whether this old man was the master of Canghai. This old man knew Canghai too well, Canghai was akin to the back of his own palms.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haha good, good. Quickly let’s go, bring this old man to see the daughter of my disciple.” The old man joyfully exclaimed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Elder, let me bring Mingyue over to see you instead.” Qing Shui suggested.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“It’s fine, I shall just treat it as taking a stroll. I’ve not left this place for decades. Mingyue, Canghai Mingyue, what a beautiful name.” The old man laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui and Fei Wuji then followed the old man as they walked towards the Misty Hall. At this moment Qing Shui discovered that the Greencloud Continent truly didn’t lack experts indeed. He wondered what was the exact cultivation of Canghai’s master.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Previously when he had met Baili Jingwei, Baili Jingwei’s cultivation was akin to god to him. But the feeling he got from Baili Jingwei back then, compared to the feeling he now got from this old man, was like a summer rain compared to a hurricane of torrential rain.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, have you joined our Heavenly Palace already? The old man asked.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I met Elder Fei as I just arrived at the Heavenly Palace, I don’t know if I can be considered a member of the Palace yet.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Canghai and Wuji were both my disciples, I had a total of 3 disciples in my life but only Wuji remains. From now onwards, you can join the Starmoon hall where Wuji is stationed.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui gives his thanks to esteemed Elder!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s fine it’s fine. I’ve lived for over 300 years but have no descendants. My disciples are my closest family. Wuji has yet to settle down and back then when Canghai was 40+ of age, there were so many talented females of our Heavenly Palace falling in love with him. Sadly, none were able to move his heart. Now that I’ve learnt he has a daughter, I’m naturally very happy.” The old man remarked. However, Qing Shui could hear the sourness and bitterness in his tone of voice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>A 300 year old man by right should already have many descendants, enjoying family bliss. However, he was all alone. Now that he has found the daughter of one of his ‘sons’, how could he not be happy?</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Lingxiao Treasure Hall was like the moon in the centre of the skies, situated in the most central location while the other halls are clustered around it in varying distances.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The Misty Hall was the nearest to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, the three of them walked for about the time it took to brew a teapot of tea, around a distance of 10 li before arriving. The Misty Hall only accepts females, which was similar to Zhu Qing Peak of the Skysword Sect. It was the only hall that accepts female disciples in the entire Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
  <p><span style>There were two rows of young ladies standing below the stone stairs. After a few seconds of observation, Qing Shui discovered that majority of the girls here were all beauties with good figures. Their talents would undoubtedly allow for all of them to reach the Xiantian level at the very least. However, no matter how beautiful they were, their beauty was still a shade paler compared to Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
  <p><span style>After all, Canghai Mingyue was one of the absolute beauties Qing Shui has seen in his entire life. Only his goddess master – Yiye Jiange, could be comparable to her. Shi Qingzhuang and Wenren Wu-shuang, although both of them were extremely stunning as well, lost out slightly when one compared their presence.</span></p>
  <p><span style>One emitted an aura of majesty, causing everyone to want to fall to their knees to worship her, while the other was a celestial lady of unsurpassed beauty, who effortlessly topples empires!</span></p>

 <p><span style>The moment the old man moved, Qing Shui understood that that was the Cloudmist Steps of the Heavenly Palace. He had seen Canghai execute this many times before, and at the instant the old man disappeared, Qing Shui swiftly tried to dodge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it could be considered that his dodge was successful, he felt something touching him. When Qing Shui looked towards the old man, he only saw the Heavenly Token that Canghai had given to him was in the hands of the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the old man brimmed with wetness as he gazed at the token, tears after tears started to roll down his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Canghai, from today onwards have no relations with the Heavenly Palace. I will bear the consequences for my own actions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me reiterate again, from today onwards, I, Canghai, am no longer a member of the Heavenly Palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master… Canghai has thrown all the face of your esteemed self away….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canghai, you are my, Cang Wuya’s disciple. No matter what you have done, I as your master, will bear the debts of your actions for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canghai, I’ve tried my best, but this useless master of yours is still unable to keep you in the Heavenly Palace. As your master, yet I’m unable even to help the slightest, I’m truly useless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man’s tears wet the token as he recalled all the previous interactions between him and Canghai. Fei Wuji stared, dumbstruck while Qing Shui currently was regretting that he had not placed the token in his spatial realm for safekeeping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canghai, live well after you leave here. Don’t worry, no one will take any further action against you. Your master is a loner with no family, if they dare touch you I shall sacrifice my useless life and make them experience hell on earth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canghai, let this token serves as a form of remembrance. I truly don’t know when would us, master and disciple, ever meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man’s hands trembled as he held the token, his body shuddering as tears continued streaming down his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, your disciple hopes that you can grant me a request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If in the future someone brings this token to the Heavenly Palace, please take care of them for me. They are my descendants, and if they really do come with this token in their hands, this means that I no longer have the ability to protect them..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, your unfilial disciple is leaving….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inclining his head, the old man glanced at Qing Shui, while breathing heavily. “How is Canghai now?” Despite everything, he hoped against hope that Canghai was still alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is no longer in this world.” Qing Shui sighed, he finally understood how close the relationship between Canghai and this old man was, only then did he heave a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, senior brother he….” Fei Wuji’s eyes were also brimming with wetness as he glanced at the old man before looking at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did he die?” The old man inquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He perished together with the old blindee from the Immortal Sword Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The old blindee which he blinded 30 years ago?” The old man exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Child, are you the son of Canghai?” The old man asked again</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m not.” Canghai bitterly smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sharp gaze of the old man locked on to Qing Shui, before he lightly spoke, “Did Canghai not have any descendants?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui stared at the old man with trepidation in his eyes, worried that something bad might happen. Upon seeing the trepidation on Qing Shui’s face, with his years of experience, the old man instantly deduced what Qing Shui was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Canghai’s master. 30 years ago he did something of such huge proportions that there was no way to close it off. I did my best, giving him a path of life, but he was unable to stay within the Heavenly Palace. Before he left, I gave him the token to serve as remembrance while he made me promise to grant a request of him. He said if in the future someone were to bear this token and look for me, the person would be his descendant and he would have already died...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So it was as such, although Qing Shui didn’t spend a great deal of time with Canghai, he knew that Canghai’s personality wouldn’t allow him to seek help from the Heavenly Palace unless he was in truly dire straits with no more paths available to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Canghai has a daughter.” Qing Shui decided to tell the truth, as there was no need to hide it any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A daughter, a daughter! Good, he has a successor.” A smile finally appeared on the old man’s countenance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She knows a little of the Heavenly Palace’s techniques and she just made her way to the Misty Hall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder I felt the lady I met earlier was so familiar, so it was because she was the daughter of my senior brother. Senior brother you can rest in peace, your daughter has arrived safely and has met master.” Fei Wuji gazed at the heavens as he mumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must be the husband that Canghai chosen for his daughter.” The eyes of the old man glowed as he stared at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui could only smile awkwardly in response, no longer doubting whether this old man was the master of Canghai. This old man knew Canghai too well, Canghai was akin to the back of his own palms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha good, good. Quickly let’s go, bring this old man to see the daughter of my disciple.” The old man joyfully exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder, let me bring Mingyue over to see you instead.” Qing Shui suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine, I shall just treat it as taking a stroll. I’ve not left this place for decades. Mingyue, Canghai Mingyue, what a beautiful name.” The old man laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui and Fei Wuji then followed the old man as they walked towards the Misty Hall. At this moment Qing Shui discovered that the Greencloud Continent truly didn’t lack experts indeed. He wondered what was the exact cultivation of Canghai’s master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously when he had met Baili Jingwei, Baili Jingwei’s cultivation was akin to god to him. But the feeling he got from Baili Jingwei back then, compared to the feeling he now got from this old man, was like a summer rain compared to a hurricane of torrential rain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui, have you joined our Heavenly Palace already? The old man asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I met Elder Fei as I just arrived at the Heavenly Palace, I don’t know if I can be considered a member of the Palace yet.” Qing Shui laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canghai and Wuji were both my disciples, I had a total of 3 disciples in my life but only Wuji remains. From now onwards, you can join the Starmoon hall where Wuji is stationed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Shui gives his thanks to esteemed Elder!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s fine it’s fine. I’ve lived for over 300 years but have no descendants. My disciples are my closest family. Wuji has yet to settle down and back then when Canghai was 40+ of age, there were so many talented females of our Heavenly Palace falling in love with him. Sadly, none were able to move his heart. Now that I’ve learnt he has a daughter, I’m naturally very happy.” The old man remarked. However, Qing Shui could hear the sourness and bitterness in his tone of voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A 300 year old man by right should already have many descendants, enjoying family bliss. However, he was all alone. Now that he has found the daughter of one of his ‘sons’, how could he not be happy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lingxiao Treasure Hall was like the moon in the centre of the skies, situated in the most central location while the other halls are clustered around it in varying distances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Misty Hall was the nearest to the Lingxiao Treasure Hall, the three of them walked for about the time it took to brew a teapot of tea, around a distance of 10 li before arriving. The Misty Hall only accepts females, which was similar to Zhu Qing Peak of the Skysword Sect. It was the only hall that accepts female disciples in the entire Heavenly Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two rows of young ladies standing below the stone stairs. After a few seconds of observation, Qing Shui discovered that majority of the girls here were all beauties with good figures. Their talents would undoubtedly allow for all of them to reach the Xiantian level at the very least. However, no matter how beautiful they were, their beauty was still a shade paler compared to Canghai Mingyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, Canghai Mingyue was one of the absolute beauties Qing Shui has seen in his entire life. Only his goddess master – Yiye Jiange, could be comparable to her. Shi Qingzhuang and Wenren Wu-shuang, although both of them were extremely stunning as well, lost out slightly when one compared their presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One emitted an aura of majesty, causing everyone to want to fall to their knees to worship her, while the other was a celestial lady of unsurpassed beauty, who effortlessly topples empires!</span></p>
