 <p><strong>AST 1405 - Grade Four Sea Dragon Dynasty, Qing Sha’s Enemy </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui had mentioned to Qing Sha before, that should she decide to leave one day, she would have to tell him personally so that he would know where she was heading.</p>
 <p>Now that Qing Sha was going to leave, Qing Shui still felt that he needed to know what she planned to do.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, don’t poke into this matter anymore. You have already helped me too much. I know I won’t be able to repay you enough no matter what I do.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked at Qing Sha, yet there was a bit of grief and relief in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knocked on her head gently and said, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll be sad listening to those words? So you don’t want this daddy, is it? Do we still need to repay things between us?”</p>
 <p>“You are my dad and will always be. My greatest fortune was meeting daddy. Even if you don’t want me anymore, you will always be my dad,” Qing Sha held onto Qing Shui’s arm and said with a tone of endearment.</p>
 <p>“Alright, from now on, no matter what it is, I will solve it for you with confidence. You are treating me like an outsider after you’ve grown up. Are you trying to make me sad on purpose?” Qing Shui said, glancing at Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>“I had a happy family before. I had a father, a mother, an elder sister and an elder brother who loved me. My father was able to obtain a powerful martial art technique somehow. I don’t why but the current members of the royalty in the Sea Dragon Dynasty felt very concerned about that. Back then, they weren’t the royalty of the Sea Dragon Dynasty yet. It was just a battle technique, but they annihilated my entire family. My parents and siblings died horribly and no one was left alive.”</p>
 <p>Qing Sha recalled the story calmly but Qing Shui and Eldest Princess were able to hear the raging anger growling behind her calm manner clearly. The hatred behind the death of her parents and siblings was irreconcilable. No matter how long it had been, as long as she was still alive, she could never forget about it. Even if she were to use eggs to fight a stone, she would have her enemies stained in yolk.</p>
 <p>“My girl, daddy will go with you!” Qing Shui said calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui, “The Sea Dragon Dynasty is very powerful. I think daddy should not go there.”</p>
 <p>“Why do you still doubt my power? I will still fulfill your wish even if I have to go to the other Three Continents, not to mention going to the Western Oxhe Continent too.” Qing Shui smiled while maintaining eye contact with Qing Sha.</p>
 <p>“I initially planned to settle this one step at a time and make them feel my turmoil. With my powers, I won’t be able to kill them all at once,” Qing Sha said in a devastated tone.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha’s power had already reached a terrifying level. If Qing Shui didn’t offer his help to her, she would have fallen into a state of Qi Deviation even if she had the Blood Terminator constitution. After all, that rate of progress was too horrifying.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha’s power had already surpassed Yehuang Guwu’s initial power back when she was still in the Western Oxhe Continent. It was a horrifying power to have existed and it was definitely the best power to exist in the Western Oxhe Continent, yet she said her powers weren’t enough to annihilate the entire Sea Dragon Dynasty.</p>
 <p>It seemed like this Sea Dragon Dynasty was quite powerful.</p>
 <p>“Daddy will accompany you and fight them head on. We will annihilate your enemies in the name of your family,” Qing Shui said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha was still young, yet she had been carrying a heavy burden for the longest time. This was a heavy burden carried in her heart, which was akin to that of a big mountain. For her to be able to endure it until now was already a remarkable thing to do.</p>
 <p>Not everyone could endure the disgrace and responsibility like she did. If it were to happen to most people, they would always have two options. The first would be going to the Sea Dragon Dynasty in haste to exact their revenge and be released from their burdens by dying quickly and the second would be forgetting about revenge entirely and living like ordinary folk.</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>Qing Shui went to visit Headmaster Sui and Headmaster Cao once more. Both of them were quite leisurely and free at the moment as they had basically dropped everything concerning the matters of Heaven Secrets Academy. However, their prestige was still regarded highly.</p>
 <p>Both of them were naturally happy to see Qing Shui. They could sense his unfathomable power, yet they had no idea about Qing Shui’s current standing of power. The disparity of their power and his was too great. Nevertheless, they were excited for him.</p>
 <p>The increase of power allowed Eldest Princess to seem a bit different than before. She had a beauty that transcended the mortal world. There was wisdom hidden in her deep, clear eyes, as well as a tinge of indescribable feeling behind her gaze. She could make people stop and take a look at her beauty.</p>
 <p>To be honest, for someone with a beautiful appearance like her and the women in the Portrait of Beauty, describing their beauty felt a bit inadequate. Just like this woman in front of him - her facial features were all perfect, especially her beautiful eyes. But the prettiest features of all would be her mannerisms and charm. It was a kind of beauty that could be understood but not described and one that could make any ordinary people feel inferior about their own appearance.</p>
 <p>She led Qing Shui by the hand contentedly and strolled along the mountain peak.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui would turn to glance at the woman beside him at times. This feeling was quite intriguing. A beautiful woman that he would never be able to see in his past life was now his woman. Moreover, the first time he saw her, the chances of them starting a relationship was nearly zero to none.</p>
 <p>But fate was just as mystical. It seemed like there was virtually a magical string binding both of them together.</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess seemed to have realized the same thing. She looked at Qing Shui and said, “I thought we were destined together when I saw you for the first time. After that, your temper became worse.”</p>
 <p>At that point, Eldest Princess laughed. That was back when they were at Rong City battling with the Scarlet Flame Sect. It was the first time Eldest Princess appeared in that place.</p>
 <p>“Then did you ever think that you would become my wife one day?” Qing Shui asked, smiling. Reminiscing about the past still felt quite pleasant to him. It felt quite nice.</p>
 <p>“No, you are a snotty brat. Hm, just a slightly powerful snotty brat.” Eldest Princess smiled as she glanced at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt that he was really a bit petty when he remembered his past self or one could say that Eldest Princess was a bit too arrogant. After being scolded like that by the Eldest Princess, Qing Shui bluntly whispered a few words into her ear, causing her face to flush red.</p>
 <p>This snotty brat was starving.....</p>
 <p>…….</p>
 <p>Eldest Princess wasn’t pregnant and this made Qing Shui think that the chances of getting pregnant were really low. If this was in his past life, she would have sought medical advice by this point. Of course, if the chances of getting pregnant was very high, most people would lose their jobs and things that were safe to sell would not be great for business anymore.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Eldest Princess never took precautions or anything whenever they copulated. Nature would take its course - if there was a child, they would raise their little one. Eldest Princess had been looking forward to having a child of her own too.</p>
 <p>It would be the greatest failure for a woman if she couldn’t become a mother in her entire lifetime!</p>
 <p>“I’ll wait until you decide that you don’t want to be here before I’ll bring you to the Dancing Phoenix Continent. The Qing Clan has already moved there.”</p>
 <p>“Even if I go there, I can’t stay at home every day. A woman will become ugly easily if she doesn’t do anything.” Eldest Princess appeared intellectual as she smiled while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was surprised by her words. There had been a saying in his past life, where working was considered important for women because they would lose their charisma should they lack a job to tackle.</p>
 <p>“Then let’s expand the Heaven Secrets Academy to the other Three Continents one day.”</p>
 <p>She was certainly a strong woman. On that note, Qing Shui had quite a lot of strong women staying by his side….</p>
 <p>After staying for two days, Qing Shui and Qing Sha left the Heaven Secrets Academy and flew towards the southernmost area of the Sea Dragon Dynasty. The desolate mountain regions were on the southwest region, but they still had to pass through a huge area of desolate mountain regions en route to the Sea Dragon Dynasty.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t his first time entering the desolate mountain regions and even though they were called the desolate mountain regions, there were many people living inside, especially near the borders.</p>
 <p>Going to the Sea Dragon Dynasty would require him to pass through the borders.</p>
 <p>As for the Desolate Sect, Qing Shui couldn't care less about destroying them. He felt that there wasn’t a need to do so anymore.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha’s Golden Ni Lion had grown stronger too. It had consumed all that it needed and had gone through multiple evolutions. The current Golden Ni Lion was almost on par with Di Chen’s Blue Luan but it was more vicious-looking than the latter.</p>
 <p>Back then, Qing Shui almost lost his life at the hands of this demonic beast which originally had a lifespan of 15 minutes. He sealed it up after that but ultimately became Qing Sha’s demonic beast in the end.</p>
 <p>With Qing Sha’s power, she could do whatever she wanted in the Western Oxhe Continent under normal circumstances. It was definitely terrifying and heaven defying for a young girl to possess such power. All of this was a favorable coincidence and if she hadn’t met Qing Shui, she wouldn’t have been able to achieve this kind of accomplishment.</p>
 <p>However, what she desired was to annihilate an entire dynasty. In truth, majority of the best ones within the Grade Four Dynasty have the power around 8000 sun or maybe less than that. But it wouldn’t be strange for a few world-transcending old monsters to appear within a big sect or a big dynasty. Things that were spread as rumors could never be trusted entirely.</p>
 <p>With the use of the Nine Continents Steps, Qing Shui and Qing Sha wouldn’t need a lot of time to reach the Sea Dragon Dynasty. However, they would still require about ten days of time to travel even with their current speed. The distance to their destination was quite far, after all.</p>
 <p>The Sea Dragon Dynasty was a huge place and that would include a vast area of sea too. A lot of islands situated within the sea area were also part of the Sea Dragon Dynasty. These southern areas were considered to be the strongest part of the dynasty. Even the barbarians wouldn’t think of provoking the Sea Dragon Dynasty that easily.</p>
 <p>Waterwolf Clan was the one controlling the Sea Dragon Dynasty.</p>
 <p>This was the same Waterwolf Clan that annihilated Qing Sha’s family.</p>
 <p>Qing Sha’s vicious spirit was formed because of this hatred before the procession to its awakening. Of course, most importantly, it was due to her body constitution. If this wasn’t the case, no matter how angry or furious she became, she wouldn’t be able to form the type of constitution that she had now.</p>
 <p>This drastic unforeseen circumstance would only hasten the awakening of Qing Sha’s constitution.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>After ten days of traveling, they had reached the Sea Dragon Dynasty. Perhaps it was due to the area being located near the sea that the climate felt extremely humid. The vegetation around here was quite dense too.</p>
 <p>Moreover, it was mostly rainy and there was no winter. The rainwater would be accumulated in a huge amount as it seemed like it would rain in every three days.</p>
 <p>The sun was bright in the sky. It was currently the scorching summer. Despite this, dense clouds could be seen hanging in the sky. Sometimes it would be hot and suffocating but compared to the stuffiness in his past life, this was much more comfortable.</p>
 <p>This place wasn’t the capital city of the Sea Dragon Dynasty as it was located on an island. However, there were so many islands in the sea and each island had its own city. If someone unfamiliar wanted to go to the capital city, they would have a hard time finding it.</p>
 <p>“Sha’er, let’s take a rest here. Tomorrow we will go straight to the city.” Qing Shui knew where the city was and he had even confirmed it by asking the locals.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Both of them stopped by an inn and decided to order a few dishes of food. This place was near the sea coast, so the dishes were mostly seafood. The taste of the food was good and it was especially fresh.</p>
 <p>It had been a long time and Qing Sha was still young back then, so they weren’t able to comprehend the true strength of the Waterwolf Clan. However, as they were one of the royal households of a Grade Four Dynasty and the overlord of this territory at that, their strength could not be far off what they had expected.</p>
 <p>But no matter how strong they were, Qing Shui would not think highly of them. He had the confidence and capability to do so.</p>
 <p>Starfish Inn!</p>
 <p>This place was a high class inn. The structure of the building was tall and luxurious and there was a high flow of traffic in front of the door. Most people frequenting the inn were wearing extravagant clothing and they were cultivators to boot.</p>
 <p>An enticing delicate aroma flowed in the air, overwhelming the sense of smell of the guests. Humans were essentially animals who desired food and sex, with food as the priority. When one had been fed and warmed up, their sexual desires would emerge. Only when one had their belly full would they think of other things. If a man was on the verge of starvation, he wouldn’t get in the mood even if he was given a lot of beautiful women. His body function may go out of order as well.</p>
 <p>Of course, most people came for pleasure when dining in the Starfish Inn instead of filling their tummy. Qing Shui had good hearing as he could hear a few women talking in a seductive voices inside the inn.</p>
 <p>Doing it on the dining table also had an exciting atmosphere to it. There wasn’t a lack of that in the World of the Nine Continents. Moreover, brothels were considered a legal business too!</p>
