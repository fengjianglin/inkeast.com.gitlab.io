 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2376 - Crushing, Chaotic Battle, Ancient Blue Topaz Leopard</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City's City Lord was trying to pass things off. He had no idea if there was any use bringing up his father at this moment. Earlier on, he had said that he would kill said person and crush him into ashes. He did not expect that the same would be done to him by Qing Shui. Either way, he knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to be able to leave this place alive today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, there are more benefits of having more friends. I didn't know any better earlier on. What must I do for you to let me off? I'll agree to any conditions that you may have." The City Lord didn't wish to die. He was in his prime, was strong, and was also a City Lord. He had great wealth, countless beautiful wives, and concubines. He didn't wish to die so soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must die today. I don't wish to become friends with trash like you." Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're the one who forced me to do this. Everyone, attack together! We'll only be able to live after killing them," The City Lord suddenly shouted. At the same time, his body seemed as if it had exploded, instantly sending peach blossom powder pollen everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui closed his eyes and grabbed the City Lord with the Dragon-capturing Hands. At the same time, he controlled the Divine Battle Puppet to dash out toward the people the City Lord had brought along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the reinforcements from Qing Shui's Battle God Halo and formations, in addition to the opponents being weakened, the Divine Battle Puppet was like a killing machine, charging straight toward those people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Priest Purewood and the others made their moves as well. Some of the other people who were implicated also joined in. Moreover, the other side was from the Forsaken Heaven Region. This was the Demon King Domain. In addition to how the Peach Blossom City's City Lord had been so domineering, many people didn't like the way he acted. After all, this wasn't the Peach Blossom City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier on, Qing Shui had said that the God Killing Pill was something that the Peach Blossom City's City Lord had gotten someone else to refine. What he was trying to say was that this medicinal pill wasn't strong enough. It didn’t mean that the God Killing Pill wasn't strong, but rather the Alchemist who refined the medicinal pill wasn't strong enough. Therefore, Qing Shui was able to neutralize this poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City's City Lord charged out toward Qing Shui. This was a battle in which he had to give it his all, dealing lethal moves every single time. Qing Shui's Berserk Dragon Fist was slightly at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stellar Transposition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City's City Lord spurted blood from the strike. Once he managed to close their distance, it would be high time to send the City Lord on his way. Therefore, Qing Shui struck out a Stellar Transposition without pulling back. His defense at full force was around ten trillion. For such an attack that could neglect the other party's defense to hit the weakened Peach Blossom City's City Lord, the latter could only be on his last breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His internal organs were practically crushed. This attack was too devastating. The Peach Blossom City's City Lord was almost shocked out of his wits. He couldn't believe that Qing Shui could unleash such a lethal attack so easily. It was a destructive blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Peach Blossom City's City Lord naturally couldn't die in peace. Qing Shui had no time to consider if he could die in peace. He charged toward the enemies, causing a huge upheaval. The battle quickly reached the end later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quite a number from their side had been injured and Qing Shui helped to save them. Other than that, it was a complete victory for them, primarily thanks to Priest Purewood, the Divine Battle Puppet, as well as Qing Shui's demonic beasts such as the Dragon Slaying Beast and the few Black Ice Divine Worms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Ice Divine Worms were very useful during the battle. The killing prowess of extremely poisonous creatures was too terrifying, especially the Black Ice Divine Worms that Qing Shui had nurtured since they were young. Their strength and poison were so strong that it would make one's scalp turn numb. More than half of the enemies had been killed solely by the Black Ice Divine Worms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great prowess that Qing Shui had displayed were seen by all, including the Fire Nation's Demon Gate. However, the Goldfinger Fowl Demon King was already dead and by now, the people from the Demon Gate already knew who had killed him. Earlier on, they only knew that their sect leader had died, but wasn't sure who had killed him. They knew by now that it was definitely this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining members of the Demon Gate didn't think of exacting revenge but were more inclined to leave quietly. Otherwise, their only way out would be to die. The difference in their strengths was too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to the place they had set up camp previously, the time for their morning regime had already ended. People who were preparing food were already on it. After all, they would have to go deeper in from now on. If things turned out to be dangerous, it would be a while before they would be able to grab a bite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui made some food and helped the two ladies neutralize the God Killing Pills. The degree of the God Killing Pills given to the two ladies was weaker, at least two notches weaker than the one that Qing Shui took. Therefore, it didn't take long for Qing Shui to neutralize the poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, look, that beauty has been looking at you all this while," Hao Tian spoke to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Qing Shui made food, the others from the Divine Palace naturally ate here as well. After all, everyone here knew that Qing Shui's meals were great delicacies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people that Nalan Qing brought along didn't eat together with Qing Shui, but they were somewhere nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui knew that Nalan Qing was looking at him. He knew that this lady was feeling a little lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn't expect that Qing Shui would be so strong, so much so that she felt that he was a little distant. She suddenly felt that this man was very far away from her and when she saw Qing Shui looking over, she smiled out of embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the beauty smiled, it wasn't overboard to say that her beauty could cause the fall of countries and cities. Nalan Qing's beauty was really that great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come on, teach me. Why do they all like you? Other than my cultivation, how am I any worse off compared to you?" Hao Tian said gloomily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Qing Shui and Hao Tian got along quite well. Qing Shui liked his character. Hao Tian was very humorous and a little preposterous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is something that can't be taught. It's the matter of one's looks." Qing Shui smiled. They were back to discussing this issue that they had already talked about in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Qing Shui's words, Hao Tian decided to not press further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui invited Priest Purewood to join him for the meal, but after rejecting for a few times, he couldn't get past Qing Shui's insistence and thus also joined them for the meal. He was all praises for Qing Shui's culinary skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wasn't selfish and gave Priest Purewood some spices for personal use. In any case, he had too many of these things in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, much more than he could finish. The ones he set aside were meant to be given away to others. To some people, these things were priceless. After all, there were people who were fond of wine, some who were fond of women, and some who were fond of delicacies. There weren't any conflicts in these. There were people who were fond of all three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Priest Purewood was alright with wine. It wasn't as if he was particularly fond of it that much. Instead, he enjoyed delicacies and was especially lucky on this occasion. Moreover, Priest Purewood said that it was his greatest takeaway to get to know Qing Shui in this trip to the divine area this time around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the meal, they prepared to set off. Qing Shui had quite a good takeaway this time: &nbsp;Six pure-blooded ancient beasts, all of them had been sealed into the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace. Other than that, there was also the City Lord's Interspatial Bangle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui scanned through what was inside the bangle and smiled. There were quite a number of good things. It was because he saw things that he needed, such as the Divine Weapon Crystals. However, he only took a glance before throwing it into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. As for the other people's Interspatial Silk Sachets, they were split between the other people who had participated in the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ordinary things that were decent no longer held any temptation to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the late afternoon, everyone set off once again. This time, they seemed a little more united. Everyone let Qing Shui and Priest Purewood take the lead. They didn't have a sense of security here and after Qing Shui had displayed his strong capabilities, everyone felt more assured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
