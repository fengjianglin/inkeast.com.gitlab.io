 <p><strong>AST 646 - The Violent Undercurrent (1)</strong></p>
 <p>“Just live in whichever one you prefer……”</p>
 <p>“You sounded so annoyed when you were saying it. Fine! I’ll make sure I knock on the door before entering your room next time!”Di Qing winked at Qing Shui and acted miserable in front of him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was speechless. It felt as if this woman couldn’t live a day without teasing him. Before he became familiar with her, he used to think that she was an unapproachable and defiant woman.</p>
 <p>Now that he got to know her well, one thing Qing Shui was clear about was that she was a troublesome woman. He wasn’t certain on whether she was still the defiant woman he thought she was but one thing that’s for sure was that she no longer behaved as her defiant-self when she was in front of Qing Shui. And ever since, her arrows have always been pointed towards him.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know if it was because he called her a stupid woman last time but he suspected that it was the reason behind why she started behaving like this and began to regret it. No wonder people always said that it’s hard to live with nasty people and women. One should never offend a woman even if it meant offending a nasty person. From this statement, we could tell just how terrifying a woman could be.</p>
 <p>From an outsider’s perspective, one would think that Qing Shui was a really happy man. Unfortunately, Qing Shui didn’t have the time to crack his head over these matters.</p>
 <p>They were quite loud when they were speaking. Hence, the people around them were all able to hear what they said. Aside from Di Fentian, no one actually paid much attention to it. Di Fentian had a weird expression. He first looked at Qing Shui, then Di Qing before moving on to Di Chen. But very quickly, his expression went back to normal.</p>
 <p>There were around seven to eight pavilion buildings of different sizes here. Aside from that, there were also four pavilions and three warehouses. Additionally, it also had three fake mountains, a few plants and trees, ponds and an arched bridge around it.</p>
 <p>Since they have had nothing to do, they decided to stroll around the pavilion building. The place was totally new. Everything was bought and setup yesterday. There was not even the slightest trace of dust within it.</p>
 <p>“Young Lady Qing!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui called out to Di Qing after seeing all of the furniture and decorations in her room.</p>
 <p>“You need to call me elder sister!”</p>
 <p>“Qing`Er, be more polite! He is your elder sister’s husband.” Di Fentian gently reprimanded Di Qing. Even though it looked like he was rebuking her, he didn’t seem like he truly meant to do so. It’s a mere formality. After all, Di Chen was Di Qing’s elder sister.</p>
 <p>“Well, he isn’t older than me!”</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er is your sister. It’s not respectful to your elder sister to do so.” Even though Di Fentian wasn’t rebuking Di Qing, he took this matter quite seriously.</p>
 <p>“Brother Tian! Don’t be so serious over such small matter! It’s just a form of address.” Qing Shui quickly intervened.</p>
 <p>“Brother-in-law!”</p>
 <p>Di Qing ran far away into the distance as soon as she finished speaking. Anyone would be able to tell that she was angry. Qing Shui smiled bitterly. He knew that this all happened because of him. If he was not here, then none of these would happen.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, go take a look at Qing`er! Try to comfort her!” Di Chen smiled and pushed Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. After that, he went to where Di Qing was in confusion. He was a bit lost on what he should do. After thinking for a while, he thought that everything should turn out fine after he comforted her.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui had already disappeared from everyone’s sight while rushing in the direction Di Qing went.</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er, what are you doing? Do you not know that Qing`Er might be attracted to Qing Shui as well?” Di Fentian confessed his thought after thinking for a while. He stared at Di Chen with a puzzled look.</p>
 <p>“I know, it's not like I can stop things like this. Why not go with the flow? Perhaps, things aren't as bad as we thought.” Di Chen looked at Di Fentian with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I am someone who has experience in these kinds of things. Chen`Er, you and Qing Shui are already husband and wife. Can't you see through Qing`Er’s scheme? Judging by her personality, if it isn't because you are her sister, she would have fought over him with you. Qing`Er has always been a competitive person since she was young. Despite this being the case, I'm still a bit worried……”</p>
 <p>“What is big brother worried about?” Di Chen smiled.</p>
 <p>“Both of my sisters are extreme beauties. Every guy would be attracted to you two. Qing Shui may be able to hold it in for now but I fear that it won't be for long. Qing`Er is stuck between you two” Di Fentian let out a sigh when he finished speaking.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, other than you, no one would actually boast about their own clan members to this extent.” Di Chen laughed.</p>
 <p>“Father is right, auntie, you and Auntie Qing are indeed the most beautiful ones.” Di Xian smiled in joy.</p>
 <p>“By the time Xian`Er grows up, she will definitely look even more beautiful than auntie.”</p>
 <p>“Chen`Er, if things were to really take such a course, have you thought about what would you do?” Di Fentian asked in concern. He didn't want unhappy things to happen between his two sisters.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, I know what you are worried about. Don't worry about it, I'm sure things would not turn out the way you imagine them to.” Di Chen responded calmly.</p>
 <p>Di Fentian felt more relieved after hearing her response. As long as Di Chen was sure that things could go on like this, everything would be fine. This actually meant that she had already come up with a way to solve it. That's why she told him to not worry over it.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui caught up to Di Qing, he was already in the backyard. Di Qing was standing by the side of the lake in the backyard staring at the fish swimming in it.</p>
 <p>“What's wrong, why are you looking so unhappy? I'll let you hit me to make you feel better.”Qing Shui approached Di Qing. He didn't really know how he should comfort her.</p>
 <p>“You always bully me.” Di Qing turned around and looked at Qing Shui with a sad expression. Even though she didn't cry, it made people feel as if she just went through something really tragic.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, it's all my fault.” Qing Shui feared this kind of scene he most. Since she wasn't his woman, it's inconvenient for him to comfort her.</p>
 <p>“Well, do you like me addressing you as brother-in-law?” Di Qing looked at Qing Shui and asked out of the blue.</p>
 <p>“It's just a form of address… It's the same whatever you call me…..” Qing Shui answered her without much thought.</p>
 <p>When Di Qing heard Qing Shui’s words, a depressed look flashed across her face. But very quickly, it went back to normal. After a while, she asked: “Do you hate me?”</p>
 <p>“Why do you ask?” Qing Shui was truly lost with what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>“You have called me a stupid woman before. Is it because I am annoying?”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled bitterly. Women were indeed the unquestioned champions when it came to being vengeful. Qing Shui answered reluctantly: “at that time, I didn't mean it to…..”</p>
 <p>“Then am I stupid……”</p>
 <p>“A bit…..”</p>
 <p>“You should die!” Di Qing hit Qing Shui softly and smiled. At that instant, the look that she had on her was extremely beautiful. Qing Shui felt that the damage that could potentially be caused by her level of beauty was nothing inferior to a divine artifact.</p>
 <p>“I'm… really that stupid……” After hitting Qing Shui, Di Qing looked at him with a miserable look.</p>
 <p>“Why have you become so unsure of yourself all of a sudden? The first time I met you, you were like a crescent moon in the sky, within my sight yet far away from my reach. You were as arrogant as a fairy. Look at you now, you’re no different than a little girl. Come, wipe off your tears and stop crying……” as soon as Qing Shui saw her smile, he felt relieved. After that, he conveniently teased her.</p>
 <p>“Go die! I have told you before, I will only address you as my brother-in-law after you become a person who could topple over the entire World of the Nine Continents.” Di Qing looked back at Qing Shui and said loudly.</p>
 <p>“If that's the case, I fear that you may not be able to call me your brother-in-law forever. You only have one elder sister, wouldn't you find it saddening that you aren’t even able to call me your brother-in-law?”</p>
 <p>At present, the atmosphere in the surrounding was really relaxed. The things that they said sounded just like they were joking with each other.</p>
 <p>Di Qing seemed like she wanted to say something. But eventually, she clenched her teeth and didn't say any of it. Qing Shui was also fine with that. After all, every time she made this kind of expression, the things that she said to him were usually things which would be hard to respond to.</p>
 <p>By the time Qing Shui and Di Qing returned to the front yard. Everyone could see them smiling. Di Qing however rolled her eyes at Di Fentian. This made Di Fentian feel a bit helpless.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, it's such a coincidence. So which brothers of mine from Di Clan have migrated here?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, a group of people entered the courtyard. At present they were already quite close to them. The voice sounded really sturdy and calm.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the people from Di Clan turned around. The first things which came to Qing Shui’s side were four people. The person who spoke was most likely a man who was slightly younger than Di Fentian yet older than Di Fenxing. He was half a head taller than Qing Shui. He had the back of a tiger and a waist which resembled that of a bear. He looked really handsome and had a pair of bright eyes. Even the simplest kind of warrior attire looked really good on him.</p>
 <p>“Sima Mingyan, why are you here?”</p>
 <p>To everyone's surprise, Di Qing was the first person to open up her mouth and speak. Qing Shui looked at Di Qing’s expression before moving on to observe others. He felt as if he has found out about something.</p>
 <p>“I have heard rumors saying that you’re really close with this man. Qing`Er, which part of me isn't good enough for you? I'll change, is that ok?” The man immediately changed his expression and begged her.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at Di Fentian in confusion. When he saw Di Fentian smile back at him, he finally realized that Sima Mingyan was someone who liked Di Qing. Since his surname was Sima, he should be someone from Sima Clan. Qing Shui knew that even though Sima Clan wasn't among one of the Seven Stars, it was not inferior to them. Seeing as Di Fentian smiled bitterly, Qing Shui felt the Di Clan wasn't really keen on offending Sima Clan.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remained silent. Even though this stuff looked really stupid, it happened quite often. There weren't many people as pretty as Di Qing in Seven Stars Country. If she wasn't born in Di Clan, she would most likely have been taken in by other men to be their personal property. At present, because of her status as a Di Clan member and the protection that came with it, it made a lot of men stop dreaming. As for the clans which were almost equal to Di Clan, it's very unlikely that their disciples wouldn't want to marry someone who was as pretty and popular as her.”</p>
 <p>“Is it of your concern that who I'm close with? What does you changing have to do with me? Stop annoying me.” Di Qing looked at Sima Huoyu in disgust.</p>
 <p>To Qing Shui’s surprise, Sima Huoyu wasn’t in the least embarrassed even after being scolded by Di Qing in front of so many people. He was still just like before, looking at Di Qing with his eyes wide-opened.</p>
 <p>“Qing`Er! I really love you. In order to pursue you, I abandoned my wife and son. Tell me, who else will love you as much as I do? I love only you!” Currently, in Sima Mingyan’s eyes, there was only Di Qing.</p>
 <p>There were people like this everywhere. What Qing Shui was truly upset with was that this man seemed like he was truly possessed by a demon. To think that he would actually abandon his own wife and children…… Does he not know that these kind of actions would only lower his points with her? Where did he get the guts to say it so arrogantly? Was he just that lustful or has he truly went crazy as a result of his obssession?</p>
 <p>“Do you know what kind of people I hate the most?” Di Qing asked calmly.</p>
 <p>“What kind of people?” At this moment, Sima Mingyan responded nervously.</p>
 <p>“The kind of people who discard others after making use of them. These kinds of people are inhuman. Which girl would dare to follow someone like you? You are never satisfied with what you have. Undoubtedly, I would also have to suffer the fate of being abandoned by you when I’m old.” Di Qing answered him without holding back.</p>
