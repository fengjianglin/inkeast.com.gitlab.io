 <p><strong>Chapter 432 Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass、Phoenix Tail？.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 432 - Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass、Phoenix Tail？</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">It took a short while before the golden glow dissipated. There were no overt changes, but Qing Shui could sense that the rabbit’s attributes had risen somewhat moderately.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Stonegold Rabbit King began to stare at Huoyun Liu-li again, but this time with a different gaze.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was just like how his Diamond Demonic Boar looked at him. Qing Shui was amazed that the rabbit could be bought over by just a single Endurance Pellet. But he thought back to how the rabbit was already mesmerized by Huoyun Liu-li even before it was fed the pellet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nevermind, anyway all is good. It is good that the Stonegold Rabbit King is with Huoyun Liu-li. It could be used for a sneak attack.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-li also fed it the remaining Endurance Pellet. Once again, there was a golden glow. After that, the Stonegold Rabbit King did not pester Huoyun Liu-li for another pellet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, what ability does this Stonegold Rabbit King have?” Qing Shui asked Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I read about Stonegold Rabbit Kings in a book called “Fantastic Beasts of the Central Continent”. Stonegold Rabbit Kings evolve from Mountain Leaping Rabbits. The evolution requires a stalk of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; “Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass?” Qing Shui said asked excitedly, interrupting Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue was perplexed when she saw Qing Shui grow so excited.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Yes, The Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass possesses a miraculous energy that allows Mountain Leaping Rabbits to direct evolve to become Stonegold Rabbit Kings,” Canghai Mingyue continued.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass can possess such an amount of energy?” Qing Shui was astonished. He remembered that the recipe for the Great Revitalizing Pellet required a Phoenix Tail. He wondered if the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was the “Phoenix Tail” mentioned.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Well, in addition to that, this little creature is very lucky. There is only a one in ten thousand chance that a Mountain Leaping Rabbit is able to fully digest and squeeze out every drop of medicinal value from the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass. That’s why I told you not to kill it.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass very common?” This was the problem that Qing Shui was most concerned about.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue smiled at Qing Shui. “This mountain range is the Phoenix Mountain Range. It is called Phoenix Mountain in short. If you look down from the sky, you will notice how the mountain range forms the shape of a flying phoenix. Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass can only be found here nowadays. They are exceedingly rare. A single stalk only appears approximately every hundred year. It only appears at the tail end of the mountain range, otherwise known as “ The Phoenix Tail”.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, so are there any Phoenix Tails here?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I suppose so. However, when this plant is near maturity, there will usually be a wild beast or demonic beast guarding it. Oddly, there are not really any strong demonic beasts around Phoenix Mountain. There are basically no Martial King level demonic beasts here, which is already out of the ordinary. The rarity of the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass should usually be guarded by Martial King level demonic beasts. Weirdly, once a demonic beast reaches Martial King level, they will choose to leave this place. How else will a Mountain Leaping Rabbit get the chance to consume the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue explained quite a lot in one go. She probably had researched about Phoenix Mountain and the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass only found exclusively here.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then, Mingyue, you probably know where Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass grows!” Qing Shui thought about his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and decided that he would harvest one even if it has not matured.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. It is not far from here. It grows in a small gorge surrounded by mountains. It is a place with good Fengshui!” Canghai Mingyue replied with a smile.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This is the place that you mentioned was suitable for your cultivation, right?” Qing Shui recalled she had made mention of something like that before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!” Canghai Mingyue nodded as she continued walking.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The three of them reached the mountaintop very quickly. The mountaintop was not smooth. It was covered with standing mountain rocks, which were a few stories tall, but they did not obstruct the view of the horizon.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Standing on the expansive rugged mountaintop, they could not see if the mountain range looked like a phoenix. Qing Shui put off proving it for now, as his priority was rather finding the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it was the “Phoenix Tail” required, or if it could replace that ingredient, he would be able to create the Great Revitalizing Pellet. He had always been fascinated by the recipe of the Great Revitalizing Pellet, and he had a feeling it may be more than he bargained for. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Effect of Great Revitalizing Pellet: Increase total stats by 20%, increase lifespan by 20 years, heals internal injuries within a short time, total stats will double within a one-hour span post-consumption, which will be followed by the user’s abilities being reduced to parity with a normal person’s for an entire month. The effects will only be limited to one pellet. Additional consumption will only cure internal injuries, extend the duration of the hour that stats are doubled, and the user’s ability will still be reduced to a normal person for one month.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he had a very one-sided understanding of the pellet. When his stats were much lower, he did not understand the impact of the doubled total stats within the one hour.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even without considering the other benefits, the effect that could double stats alone was already heaven-defying!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Phoenix Tail, Flower of Life...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">These were based on the foundation of boosting total strength. He had always only thought that the pellet was amazing as it could provide an additional 20 years to one’s lifespan and could cure internal injuries.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He now knew the significance of the temporary effect of the double stats only when he had reach this level of strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he had reached the peak of the Marital King Level and then consumed the Great Revitalizing Pellet, was it possible for him to destroy Sword Tower?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui is dreaming again. Look at that expression, it is so funny!” Huoyun Liu-li pinched Qing Shui’s waist.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have we arrived?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just over there.” Canghai Mingyue pointed ahead.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui discovered that they had already reached the edge of a gorge. It inclined downwards and they could hear the sound of a waterfall. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They walked into the gorge. For a second, Qing Shui thought he had entered an indescribably beautiful realm of sorts. There were hills, water, trees and land.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was a huge waterfall pool not far from them. The medium sized waterfall created the additional sense of otherworldly beauty as the birds and beasts gathered around the pool.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every now and then, there were little animals appearing. There were also Mountain Leaping rabbits, as not many other creatures could do much to them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, since this herb is so valuable, why are there no large family clans guarding this place. Or even re-planting them somewhere else?” Qing Shui felt that this point was odd.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Phoenix Mountain is not very famous in Cang Lang Country. Furthermore, it takes a hundred year for one Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass to grow. Who will have that sort of patience? Furthermore, it only gives an opportunity for a demonic beast to evolve or explode to death. Thus, even though it is rare, it is not that useful. The Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass will also die if it leaves this gorge. Maybe it takes too much skill, or it is not really that good. The energy it possesses is real, but at this moment, no alchemist can use it.” Canghai Mingyue walked towards a purple black patch of land when she finished explaining.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had the feeling that the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was indeed the Phoenix Tail that he was looking for. It was because such energy could only be found in the “phoenix tail”. It must be the active ingredient in Great Revitalizing Pellet that grants that overall doubling in strength without being limited by the user’s cultivation level.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It should be able to affect any level of user, but Qing Shui was not sure if the double effect was based on base capabilities or overall boosted ability.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This temporary effect usually applied itself to the overall boosted ability. Qing Shui had high hopes for the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass and the Great Revitalizing Pellet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This could be the crux of the problem that determines his success at the Sword Tower. After all, the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass only appears once in a hundred years, and it was not like he could grow them on trees.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was why the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was so rare. He could not even use his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. As what he heard from Canghai Mingyue, the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass did not have any seeds. It was grown from the essence of the Phoenix Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Look, there. Unfortunately, it seems to be only a few years old.” Canghai Mingyue pointed at the area near one of the rocks.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes!”&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui followed Canghai Mingyue’s vision and saw clearly a stalk of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass nearby. It was golden and just as tall as a hand palm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It only looked golden. Actually, it should not be. This was because the stalk of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was beside a one metre square golden rock. There was a strong spiritual energy flowing through the rock.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Stonegold!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was very excited. The palm height Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was the Phoenix tail he was looking for. It must have been form with the influence of the Stonegold.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Its effect should surpass even a real phoenix tail!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a rush of hot-blooded excitement. He would now be able to create the Great Revitalizing Pellet. But now he was hesitant, as he did not know if it could persist in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But it still needs a hundred years. What can happen in a hundred years? If it was destroyed in this timeframe, wouldn’t that be a pity? Qing Shui thought about it and came to a decision.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He must replant it in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It should work!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I will take a bath first. Will you two be bathing?” Qing Shui asked the two ladies.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“To hell with it! Qing Shui!” Huoyun Liu-li spat.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui a look of annoyance as she pulled Huoyun Liu-li away from the gorge.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not do anything about it. The secret of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and his origin was something that he could not tell anyone. This would do them no good and only bring disasters.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He did not want them to see. It would be very troublesome for him to come up with a lie and explain himself, so he would much rather find such an easy solution. Qing Shui scanned the area with his Spirtual Sense and confirmed that there were no demonic beast guarding the area.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui directly dug out the entire plot of land with the large Stonegold within it. In his previous world, this was not something that could be done in one day as a stone of that size and composition required a few men to carry.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took the Stonegold, the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass, and at least 2 meters worth of soil located beneath the grass. He transfered it all into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“It will depend on fate whether it can survive.” Qing Shui prayed silently.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He dug a huge hole in the Realm and placed the piece of earth with the Stonegold into it. He did not even touch the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass, feeling that this was the best measure he could take.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The three of them reached the mountaintop very quickly. The mountaintop was not smooth. It was covered with standing mountain rocks, which were a few stories tall, but they did not obstruct the view of the horizon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Standing on the expansive rugged mountaintop, they could not see if the mountain range looked like a phoenix. Qing Shui put off proving it for now, as his priority was rather finding the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it was the “Phoenix Tail” required, or if it could replace that ingredient, he would be able to create the Great Revitalizing Pellet. He had always been fascinated by the recipe of the Great Revitalizing Pellet, and he had a feeling it may be more than he bargained for. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Effect of Great Revitalizing Pellet: Increase total stats by 20%, increase lifespan by 20 years, heals internal injuries within a short time, total stats will double within a one-hour span post-consumption, which will be followed by the user’s abilities being reduced to parity with a normal person’s for an entire month. The effects will only be limited to one pellet. Additional consumption will only cure internal injuries, extend the duration of the hour that stats are doubled, and the user’s ability will still be reduced to a normal person for one month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he had a very one-sided understanding of the pellet. When his stats were much lower, he did not understand the impact of the doubled total stats within the one hour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even without considering the other benefits, the effect that could double stats alone was already heaven-defying!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Phoenix Tail, Flower of Life...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">These were based on the foundation of boosting total strength. He had always only thought that the pellet was amazing as it could provide an additional 20 years to one’s lifespan and could cure internal injuries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He now knew the significance of the temporary effect of the double stats only when he had reach this level of strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he had reached the peak of the Marital King Level and then consumed the Great Revitalizing Pellet, was it possible for him to destroy Sword Tower?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui is dreaming again. Look at that expression, it is so funny!” Huoyun Liu-li pinched Qing Shui’s waist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have we arrived?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just over there.” Canghai Mingyue pointed ahead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui discovered that they had already reached the edge of a gorge. It inclined downwards and they could hear the sound of a waterfall. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They walked into the gorge. For a second, Qing Shui thought he had entered an indescribably beautiful realm of sorts. There were hills, water, trees and land.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was a huge waterfall pool not far from them. The medium sized waterfall created the additional sense of otherworldly beauty as the birds and beasts gathered around the pool.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every now and then, there were little animals appearing. There were also Mountain Leaping rabbits, as not many other creatures could do much to them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mingyue, since this herb is so valuable, why are there no large family clans guarding this place. Or even re-planting them somewhere else?” Qing Shui felt that this point was odd.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Phoenix Mountain is not very famous in Cang Lang Country. Furthermore, it takes a hundred year for one Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass to grow. Who will have that sort of patience? Furthermore, it only gives an opportunity for a demonic beast to evolve or explode to death. Thus, even though it is rare, it is not that useful. The Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass will also die if it leaves this gorge. Maybe it takes too much skill, or it is not really that good. The energy it possesses is real, but at this moment, no alchemist can use it.” Canghai Mingyue walked towards a purple black patch of land when she finished explaining.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had the feeling that the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was indeed the Phoenix Tail that he was looking for. It was because such energy could only be found in the “phoenix tail”. It must be the active ingredient in Great Revitalizing Pellet that grants that overall doubling in strength without being limited by the user’s cultivation level.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It should be able to affect any level of user, but Qing Shui was not sure if the double effect was based on base capabilities or overall boosted ability.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This temporary effect usually applied itself to the overall boosted ability. Qing Shui had high hopes for the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass and the Great Revitalizing Pellet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This could be the crux of the problem that determines his success at the Sword Tower. After all, the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass only appears once in a hundred years, and it was not like he could grow them on trees.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was why the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was so rare. He could not even use his Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. As what he heard from Canghai Mingyue, the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass did not have any seeds. It was grown from the essence of the Phoenix Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Look, there. Unfortunately, it seems to be only a few years old.” Canghai Mingyue pointed at the area near one of the rocks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui followed Canghai Mingyue’s vision and saw clearly a stalk of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass nearby. It was golden and just as tall as a hand palm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It only looked golden. Actually, it should not be. This was because the stalk of Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was beside a one metre square golden rock. There was a strong spiritual energy flowing through the rock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Stonegold!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was very excited. The palm height Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass was the Phoenix tail he was looking for. It must have been form with the influence of the Stonegold.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Its effect should surpass even a real phoenix tail!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt a rush of hot-blooded excitement. He would now be able to create the Great Revitalizing Pellet. But now he was hesitant, as he did not know if it could persist in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But it still needs a hundred years. What can happen in a hundred years? If it was destroyed in this timeframe, wouldn’t that be a pity? Qing Shui thought about it and came to a decision.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He must replant it in the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal. It should work!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I will take a bath first. Will you two be bathing?” Qing Shui asked the two ladies.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“To hell with it! Qing Shui!” Huoyun Liu-li spat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue gave Qing Shui a look of annoyance as she pulled Huoyun Liu-li away from the gorge.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could not do anything about it. The secret of the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal and his origin was something that he could not tell anyone. This would do them no good and only bring disasters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He did not want them to see. It would be very troublesome for him to come up with a lie and explain himself, so he would much rather find such an easy solution. Qing Shui scanned the area with his Spirtual Sense and confirmed that there were no demonic beast guarding the area.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui directly dug out the entire plot of land with the large Stonegold within it. In his previous world, this was not something that could be done in one day as a stone of that size and composition required a few men to carry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took the Stonegold, the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass, and at least 2 meters worth of soil located beneath the grass. He transfered it all into the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“It will depend on fate whether it can survive.” Qing Shui prayed silently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He dug a huge hole in the Realm and placed the piece of earth with the Stonegold into it. He did not even touch the Stonegold Phoenix Tail Grass, feeling that this was the best measure he could take.&nbsp;</p>
