 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"May I ask what the Chi Clan owes you?" Chi Clan frowned but still asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master's youngest disciple, our Youngest Martial Brother has been killed by your people. Therefore, we're here to ask for a head," The man on the left said slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't know who your Youngest Martial Brother is. The people we killed were all evil-doers and trash. We didn't kill your Youngest Martial Brother," At this moment, Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Qing Shui had spoken, Chi Yang didn't continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man on the left frowned but still said, "Wu Xingyun was our Youngest Martial Brother."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, so it was him. I was wondering who that was. A person of that capability didn't know any better and wanted to kill us. In the end, he got killed by us instead. People like him who come to seek trouble deserves to be killed. If someone were to head to the Divine Rain Sect to create trouble, how would they be punished?" Qing Shui said very smoothly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They would deserve to be killed!" The man on the right said outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after saying this, the man seemed to feel that something was off. At this moment, Qing Shui was clapping. "You're right. That's why we killed him. Heading to seek trouble with another party is an act of the strong bullying the weak. When faced against these kinds of people, one must give them a harsh beating."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By now, anyone could tell the intention hidden behind Qing Shui's words. It felt as though he was challenging them. It was hard for them not to notice it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, we won't say much. We've gotten our Master's orders to bring a head back," said the man on the left, clearly displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Taking someone's head? Coming to take someone's head? Whose head are you going to take?" Qing Shui asked nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're here to take the head of the perpetrator. Since this matter was done by the Chi Clan, then the clan head should bear the responsibility. You people should feel lucky. If it was in the past, the heads of everyone here would probably be taken," The man on the left said this as a matter of fact, as if this was something he was very familiar with. Both of them were wearing an expression as if the Chi Clan was the one who had benefited from this arrangement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang's countenance was very grim. He had sought his vengeance. If he were to die now as the price, the other members of the Chi Clan could live, it wouldn't be that bad of a deal...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Has the Divine Rain Sect always been like this, not caring what's right or wrong and making judgements based on their perspectives?" Qing Shui frowned, but his tone was still very calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you mean? Young man, who are you? Be careful of what you say. Is the Divine Rain Sect's actions something you can criticize?" The countenance of the man on the left appeared to be darker by the second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Qing Shui, if my death can ensure the safety of the entire Chi Clan, it's not bad. My only regret is that I've yet to see Ao`er and Feng`er," said Chi Yang bitterly, finding this a little hard to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, have you forgotten what I said earlier? You're already this strong, so how can you accept death so willingly? It's no wonder that it's hard for you to attain a breakthrough and advance further. You are the one who has restricted yourself." Qing Shui shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hahaha, young man, it seems that you don't wish to accept fate. Should we say that you're young and arrogant, or that you're young and ignorant, hmm?" The man seemed to find this very funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't care what the Divine Rain Sect is. If you insist on bringing back a head, I'll give you your wish. One of you can take the other man's head back." Qing Shui looked at the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lad, do you know that you're courting death?" The man on the left frowned like he never did before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget it. You've been flaunting a lot. I'll just take your head for you then," Qing Shui took action immediately after saying this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Confinement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Art of Pursuing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Berserk Dragon Fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui used te Berserk Dragon Fist to perform Combination Fist Technique. This meant that he could beat the opponent to the extent that they wouldn't be able to retaliate, aiming for their weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Vision Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui then continued to slow the man's speed down until it was equal to that of a snail's. The Heavenly Vision Technique reduced the opponent's speed to a terrifying extent. The person's speed had been weakened by half at the start of the battle; adding the Heavenly Vision Technique, it didn’t even need to be mentioned anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this, when he performed the Combination Fist Technique, it had been ineffective due to his low attacking prowess. But now, it was alright. He landed a punch onto that man's chest and then got close with the Windwhisk Willow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gouging Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kneeing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui kneed the opponent's lower body...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of something shattering rang out loud. Qing Shui didn't harbor any good will toward this man. And since he had decided to kill, he decided to be even more straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ahhh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying cry had just rung out when Qing Shui reached out his hand and locked the man's throat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kacha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything came to a standstill. Shockingly, the battle only took the time it needed for one to blink three times, for it to come to an end. Qing Shui waved his hand and the man's corpse landed next to the other man, saying, "Take him back to see your Master. Tell him that I welcome his arrival."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they were going to compare the strength of their fists, Qing Shui couldn't be bothered to say much. He merely asked the man to relay the message so that they could just go ahead and fight it out. He was obviously not scared of the Divine Rain Sect, as well as not having any good will towards them. They were overbearing and would bully the weak just because they were strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other guy was in a daze. They tended to be the side to take other people's lives without batting an eyelid. This was the first time they were on the losing side, almost getting wiped out in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, this man was not exactly the only one who was stunned; Chi Yang was so flabbergasted that he could only stare at him blankly. Earlier on, he could only see a series of afterimages from Qing Shui's actions. To think that with his current strength, he could only see afterimages. How strong was Qing Shui?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's Heavenly Vision Technique didn't actually reduce the opponent's speed, but instead, increased his own perception of speed. It was unlike the Art of Pursuing. Otherwise, the effects of the Heavenly Vision Technique could be shared with other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't that these two men were weak, only that Qing Shui's strength was too terrifying. Qing Shui was trying to help Chi Yang regain his confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang wasn't to blame. All the people from the Lower Three Regions would feel helpless before the members of the Divine Rain Sect. Only Qing Shui wouldn't feel fear toward this massive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang smiled bitterly. They had no way of retreating now. The other party would definitely not let this matter slide, as right now, the matter wouldn't be settled by just a single head. If they were to take any action next, the Chi Clan would be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man sighed, picked up that dead man whose eyes were wide open. The man who died probably didn't think that he would die in such a way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man left. Many people had seen the two men from the Divine Rain Sect entering, but now they saw one of them end up being carried out. A commotion broke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared with the commotion within the Chi Clan, the commotion outside was like an erupting volcano.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After knowing that the Chi Clan had killed a member of the Divine Rain Sect, no one else dared to visit the Chi Clan. It would only bring trouble their way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Chi Clan is too idiotic and arrogant this time around. To think that they're so overconfident to want to go up against the Divine Rain Sect. They really think of themselves as some kind of unmatchable force."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. They've become dizzy with success that they don't even see who they are up against."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How many years has it been? No one has dared to raise a hand against the Divine Rain Sect. I wonder how angry the Divine Rain Sect would be this time around?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What can happen? The Chi Clan will bleed rivers of blood, and they will be completely wiped out. We better stay far away from the Chi Clan in case we get implicated."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Divine Rain Sect has become accustomed to being domineering. I wonder if the Chi Clan has any ability to put up a fight."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shush, be careful; the Divine Rain Sect may hear you," said an old man</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When someone reaches that realm, the ones who are domineering are the people under them. The main people won't have the time to be domineering!" joked one of the men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's true. I wonder if the Chi Clan will be able to defeat those domineering people under them. If the people in charge took part in this, then the Divine Rain Sect might have to go through some reorganizing," The old man smiled and shook his head.</span></p>
