 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not like Qing Shui wasn’t satisfied with it. However, he could tell that these people must have a favor to ask from him. Besides, these people were all no ordinary people. The current Qing Shui was also able to figure out the origin of these people. They all possessed the Great Confucian Qi within their body. Also, the face of the young man was similar to the Little Prince and Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They all walked to the backyard. Qing Shui arrived at a pavilion and requested them to sit down. When he was passing by the main hall, he heard a few noises made by his family members. That was why he brought them to the backyard instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there anything you would like to ask me?” Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man saw the warm smile which Qing Shui had on his face, “Young man, this is my great-grandson. I came today with the hope that you may take him as your disciple.” The old man was very straightforward with his motive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing that, Qing Shui was in a great shock. He stared at the old man and didn’t know what to reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Patriarch… This….. This……” The young man was also greatly shocked by the old man’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thirteenth Prince, are you not convinced by it? Do you think that we will ever harm you? Besides, if you truly fail to see through our good intention, we will be greatly disappointed.” The old man immediately interrupted the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, you must be joking. I don’t have the slightest qualification to accept a disciple. It will be no problem if you want me to teach him some medical things here. However, I would like to avoid taking disciples at all cost.” Qing Shui waved his hand. This must be a joke. This kind of thing would not benefit him in the slightest. He would definitely not do something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qing Shui was able to tell that he was a Battle God Inheritor. Under normal circumstances, if he ran into a Battle God Inheritor, he would definitely try to get him to side with him. This also played a very huge part in it. Otherwise, Qing Shui would have definitely rejected it. However, he mustn’t give in so easily this time as he wasn’t sure of the person’s motive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, though I am a very old man with half-step into the grave, I will admit that I am not that bad at observing people. Please don’t act humbly and undervalue yourself. I can assure you that my visit today is absolutely not accompanied by even the slightest harmful intention. Judging by how smart you are, you should be able to figure out my motive.” The old man chuckled as he drank the tea which Qing Shui made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, though ten years of life isn’t really that long, but there is also no point rushing it.” Qing Shui looked at the old man. He was naturally able to tell about the old man’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the old man wasn’t old to the point that he was dying, a huge part of the reason still had to do with this. Even if Qing Shui was to help him, he would only be able to live for a few more years. Besides, taking the old man’s realm into consideration, it had no difference between living ten years or a bit more than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was stunned. Though he had heard that the young man possessed decent medical expertise, he was still shocked by the fact that Qing Shui could tell about his remaining lifespan in one glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truth be told, the Thirteenth Prince has been acknowledged to be the next Great Emperor of the Great Confucian Empire. You don’t need to worry about it. About the Barbaric Emperor, I will go look for that brat and talk to him about it. It is his fortune that you are able to cure him. This was all just a misunderstanding. Also, I also wouldn’t let your effort to take him as your disciple be for naught. There are some things I have which I think may pique your interest. At the very least, I will make sure that you don’t lose anything from this.” The old man made sure he keep the long story short.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, even without the old man’s money, Qing Shui would still interact with the Thirteenth Prince. It was all due to the fact that he was a Battle God Inheritor. However, if Qing Shui was to interact with him through that method, the Thirteenth Prince would naturally end up like Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong and became brothers with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man, let’s dismiss the idea of letting me take him as my disciple. I am not as old as him.” Qing Shui really didn’t feel like taking a disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When you are at our age, we can already ignore things like this. The one who discovers the truth should be the teacher. There are people who are a hundred years old but still possess the look of someone at their 20s. I want him to truly pay respect to you as his master and let him view you as a father figure. Thirteenth Prince!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the young man walked to him with a calm face, “It is a pleasure for the disciple to meet master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the young man actually kneeled down to greet Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s expression immediately became heavy. He extended his arm and pulled him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not in the least annoyed with the tough-looking man. He seemed to be a steady man who didn’t speak much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old man……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man swung his hand, “Consider it as me taking an unfair advantage out of you. Logically speaking, for someone at my level, I should have been able to see through things. That’s also what I have always thought prior to this. But I am still a bit uncomfortable with the current Great Confucian Empire. This is for you. It will definitely bring a lot of benefits to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man took out a crystal-like box. The box was about one cubic foot and transparent. Within it was a mysterious smoke-like substance. It has managed to condense into the shape of a miniature man. It was very stately and respectful. It seemed like the Qi of a God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Immortal Dao Divine Origin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui looked at the crystal box in disbelief. At the instant he spotted this, its name had already appeared within his mind. This was the memory given to him by the Golden Battle God. Of course, he was also aware of how precious it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was way too precious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Immortal Dao Divine Origin was born from the most powerful Divine Grade experts, and they might be even more powerful than that. They were known as the Immortal Dao and could be considered as a God-like treasure. After these people died, there would be a very, very tiny chance of their Origin Essence condensing into Divine Origin. This would then become the Immortal Dao Divine Origin. Once Qing Shui refined it, the benefits he could earn from it would be immeasurable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was one thing about the Immortal Dao Divine Origin, not just everyone could refine it. It could be said that only one genius out of millions could possibly use it. Only a person with unique body physique would be able to fuse with it. Furthermore, his strength mustn’t be below the Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So far, the Nine Yang Golden Body was the only known body physique which could withstand the domineering might of the Immortal Dao Divine Origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally, the Nine Yang Golden Body should be able to withstand it. But overall, it was still quite unpredictable whether this would really happen. In the history of the Nine Continents, it was said that people, who made it through the process successfully, were blessed with huge benefits. However, there had also been rumors which said that some people died as a result of their body bursting. The sight was unbearable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that the old man was aware of his Nine Yang Golden Body. Actually, to put it simply, only people with Extreme Yang Body could use the Immortal Dao Divine Origin. The more extreme their Yang Body was, the higher the chance of success was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn’t find it shocking that the old men knew he possessed such a physique. As long as a person was strong enough, he would be able to roughly sense the physique of someone. The reason, why the old men knew about it, was because Tianlong has mentioned it to him before. Besides, it was very easy for people with the Nine Yang Golden Body to become expert warriors. Hence, normally, people would try to make friends with him.</span></p>

I can’t take it.” After a moment of hesitation, Qing Shui still insisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t get a reward if it’s not well deserved”. Qing Shui rejected it.</span></p>

Though he had already promised to take the young man to be his disciple, the Immortal Path Divine Origin was still a very precious thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who said that you have done nothing? You accepted the Thirteenth Prince to be your disciple. Besides, this thing will surely benefit you. To the majority of people, including myself, this is only something which I can look at. Sword for heroes, gifts for beauties. If you continue to deny it, I will take it as you looking down on me. To be honest, I am already very satisfied to be able to meet someone who could truly use it in my entire lifetime.” The old man revealed a very warm smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, I will accept it.” Qing Shui extended his hand and accepted it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, you must be careful while using it. You mustn’t let your guard down even though you possess a formidable constitution. It’s best if you find a place where you will never be interrupted. Also, you must be in a very calm condition while using it.” The old man reminded Qing Shui in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s concern made Qing Shui very happy. He felt a sense of warmth in his heart. No matter what, he found this old man to be quite a decent person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you!” Qing Shui carefully took it over and immediately insert it into the realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well then, we will stop interrupting you. Thirteenth Prince, you should stay here. Remember, your master is like your father.” The old man said in a very serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep down, the old man was at ease thinking that the young generation in his clan could grasp an opportunity like this. In the future, he would definitely bring prosper to the Xia Clan. He hoped that one day, the Thirteenth Prince would give a lot of thought to the things which he had done for him.</span></p>
