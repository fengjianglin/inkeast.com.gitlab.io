  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 366 He Likes Mature Women... Recreating the Big Dipper Sword</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui now felt that love was in fact a feeling, an intricate feeling between men and women!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Humans tend to be contradicting creatures, and for many things, there is no absolute line of differentiation!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Then you must not like me for even a little bit." When Xiang Bao said this, she had on a grudging expression. She did not know when she had started to feel that Qing Shui was very special. And when she mentioned it to him the previous time, he had already soared to great heights.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, she was already rejected previously. Within a short three years, he once again appeared, bright as a shining star, an existence beyond her reach. She felt an intense sense of helplessness from deep within her.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I don't know how to say this. Towards you, I don't have the feelings of love between men and women. When I look at you, it's as if I'm looking at our Little Bei, understand?" Qing Shui smiled bitterly and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiang Bao long understood that Qing Shui did not like her. He liked Shi Clan's Shi Qingzhuang, Mingyue Gelou who was at Qing Clan, at that lady who was like a goddess.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"He likes elegant women with a mature disposition, dignified women, as well as those women with stories behind them... Not immature girls like myself..." Xiang Bao could not help but guess.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Can you accompany me for a walk?" Xiang Bao smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood there, hesitant. He now had no wish to get involved with women he had no relations with, although she was a beautiful girl!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"If Qing Bei asked you to accompany her for a walk, will you also be so hesitant?" Xiang Bao smiled and looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Having not met each other for three years, Qing Shui never would have thought that the little girl from back then had now become someone with feminine charms. Her teasing smile from earlier made him feel that the little girl had grown up.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Let's go. You can decide where to go, uncle will accompany you!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiang Bao felt gloomy for a moment before she once again broke into a smile, grabbing onto Qing Shui's arm naturally and said, “Uncle, let's go then!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, it was Qing Shui's turn to feel gloomy, but there was nothing he could do about it. She had already addressed him as uncle, so what else could he say? It was just that he had originally wanted to go to Shi Clan, but now, he would have to give that a miss.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When she was together with Qing Shui, Xiang Bao thought about a lot of things. How good would it be if this guy belonged to her? She even wanted to tell him that she did not mind how many women he had, as long as he was good to her. But no matter what, she could not make herself say this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most importantly, Xiang Bao knew that he did not like this side of her. Would he like her in another eight or ten years? But a woman's maturity was not dependent on her age, and a woman's disposition was not so easily built up either.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Uncle, how long would you be staying this time around?" Xiang Bao said softly. At this moment, Xiang Bao was planning to leave behind as many memories as she could. It was because she had this feeling that in the future, the number of times they would meet each other would be extremely few, or even none at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could only smile bitterly. To think that this lass was now calling him uncle so naturally. He had only intended to tease her at first, but to think that she had actually taken advantage of this and retaliated.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I don't know. Probably one year, or at most two!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hearing Qing Shui's words, Xiang Bao's expression became brighter than before. She lifted her head and looked at Qing Shui, "Then can I look for you when I miss you?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he was almost led by the nose by this little lass. However, he still smiled and said, "You can, but I'm usually very busy and don't have time at all."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Walking like this, strolling along the streets, Qing Shui knew that this lass was kindhearted and bright, and he really treated her as if he would Qing Bei.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very quickly!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Uncle, it's already late. Let's go get some food!" Xiang Bao had no idea how many times she had called him uncle today, but she had gotten over it. What was important that the two of them were very happy during this period of time. Why did she need to think so much about it? Moreover, this was all just a joke, and was for fun.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them entered a very normal looking restaurant in Hundred Miles City. The restaurant looked very clean, and was targeted towards commoners. They ordered some ordinary dishes commonly found in ordinary households.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They had a heartwarming meal with no weird atmosphere between them as there would be when a couple was together. After all, Qing Shui did not feel that way about her at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they eventually parted, Qing Shui noticed a hint of unwillingness in Xiang Bao's eyes. Qing Shui's interactions with her were extremely little and he did not understand why Xiang Bao was feeling this way towards him when they were meeting after three years. He shook his head, not willing to think too much about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The day passed by just like that. Qing Shui decided to make a trip to Shi Clan the next day to see if he would be able to bring Shi Qingzhuang through the doors of Xiantian. After all, she was now a cultivator at the pinnacle of Houtian as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Because of Qing He's achievements, everyone in Qing Clan was extremely excited. Mingyue Gelou's breakthrough was because of her monstrous talent and was something that was useless for them to feel jealous about. But it was not the same of Qing He's case. It was like the light of dawn on darkness, an inspiring vigority.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he went back, it was already dark and they were about to have dinner. Qing Shui did not want to dampen their mood and thus joined them for dinner. It was very lively, and there was also Little Yuchang.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui started his cultivation upon entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, only recalling his Big Dipper Sword when he was cultivating his Thousand Hammer Technique, that Big Dipper Sword which had no attributes at all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He could not help but recall that strong and mysterious divinity he felt back then. That strong and overwhelming divinity which he had taken the Big Dipper Sword from.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Could it be that this was a divine weapon left behind by gods? Could it be that this Big Dipper Sword is not as simple as it appears to be, an extremely heavy sword...?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui put down the Heaven Shaking Hammer in his hands and picked up the Big Dipper Sword. He planned to take time to go back to that place to see if he could have additional gains, but felt a great sense of helplessness when he thought about that strong and overwhelming pressure.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's good to take a look. I can at least take it as a chance to temper my muscles and bones with that pressure!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Sweeping his gaze towards the ten White Tiger Stones, Qing Shui thought of an idea. Maybe he should try applying "forging" on that Big Dipper Sword.There were two types of forging techniques in the Ancient Art of Forging.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The first one was to forge from the start, smelting, casting, tempering... It was the traditional way of forging!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Other than that, there was also another way of forging listed in the Ancient Art of Forging, which was to add on some other materials to the completed item, and then temper it with the Thousand Hammer Technique. It was like how he had done for the armors, battle boots, helmet and bangle to raise their grade to '2-color'.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This method did not exist in the world of the nine continents. There was only one forging opportunity for armors and weapons, and once completed, they could only be smelted and forged from the beginning in the future.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After thinking for a very long time, Qing Shui decided to try this out. In the worse case scenario, he would just have wasted those few pieces of White Tiger Stones. Qing Shui was not worried about damaging the Big Dipper Sword since the unique characteristic of this second method of forging would not damage the original object itself nor reduce their attributes or abilities.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was also why Qing Shui decided to give it a try. Another reason was because his forging level had already reached 2-color, and was almost reaching the great perfection stage for the 2-color grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Taking out ten pieces of White Tiger Stones, Qing Shui first tempered them with the primordial flames. The greyish white White Tiger Stones turned into a milky white color, looking especially nice, exuding a gentle white glow.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only now did Qing Shui feel that these were worthy to be called the White Tiger Stones, deserving of the spiritual Qi in them. Qing Shui lovingly played around with these White Tiger Stones which felt like white jade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As he did so, Qing Shui recalled a famous person from his previous life. That person's wife had extremely good skin, and the thing the person loved to do most was to undress his wife completely and placing a piece of white jade next to her. However, he could never make up his mind of which was superior, his wife's skin or the white jade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui returned the White Tiger Stones to their their original appearance which was like a piece of white jade, placing them in a row, looking at how they were emitting a soft glow. If it was in his previous life, he would be able to get an unimaginable sum of money from them if they were auctioned...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Creating another sword mold from the start, a mold that he could place the Big Dipper Sword in. He then tempered the Big Dipper Sword again with primordial flames. Qing Shui realized that the Big Dipper Sword could stand extremely high temperatures, but still, he did not dare to temper it for too long.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui placed the ten pieces of White Tiger Stones into the sword mold and then smelted them with primordial flames. It did not take long for all of the White Tiger Stones to become a milky white colored liquid.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then placed the Big Dipper Sword in the sword mold as well. The Big Dipper Sword was submerged in the liquid from the White Tiger Stones.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then started to smelt with primordial flames again. The liquid from the White Tiger Stones gradually came to a boil, and then worked its way into the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very slowly. And although Qing Shui was worried that even the Big Dipper Sword would be melted as well, he then noticed that his current primordial flames were not able to melt the Big Dipper Sword. Feeling relieved, he increased the primordial flames, and the liquid from the White Tiger Stone bubbled even more ferociously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the last drop of liquid from the White Tiger Stone fused together with the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui quickly stretched out his left hand, circulating his "Saintly Hands", and the almost transparent left hand grabbed the Big Dipper Sword as Qing Shui moved towards the forging platform.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Waving the Heaven Shaking Hammer with his right hand, he started forging this Big Dipper Sword which had now turned into a milky white color!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Ding ding ding...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Loud sounds of metals clashing together rang out. It was just that no one was able to see this scene. The ancient and unsophisticated feeling emitted by the Heaven Shaking Hammer was stronger than ever, and each hammer was extremely powerful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The color of the milky white Big Dipper Sword slowly dissipated together with Qing Shui's hammerings, returning to its formal color.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The speed at which Qing Shui was hammering was not fast, and the gap between each hammer was exactly the same. The Heaven Shaking Hammer would land on the Big Dipper Sword without any delay.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui did not know how many times he had hammered, nor did he know how many rounds of tempering he had gone through. This time, it was as if he had completely exceeded his knowledge of the Ancient Art of Forging completely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the radiant light glowed, Qing Shui squinted his eyes to look at the Big Dipper Sword which had resumed its original form. It looked exactly like before, but Qing Shui knew that the Big Dipper Sword had undergone an earth shattering transformation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It had become more dignified and magnificent than before...</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized that he was almost led by the nose by this little lass. However, he still smiled and said, "You can, but I'm usually very busy and don't have time at all."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Walking like this, strolling along the streets, Qing Shui knew that this lass was kindhearted and bright, and he really treated her as if he would Qing Bei.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very quickly!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Uncle, it's already late. Let's go get some food!" Xiang Bao had no idea how many times she had called him uncle today, but she had gotten over it. What was important that the two of them were very happy during this period of time. Why did she need to think so much about it? Moreover, this was all just a joke, and was for fun.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them entered a very normal looking restaurant in Hundred Miles City. The restaurant looked very clean, and was targeted towards commoners. They ordered some ordinary dishes commonly found in ordinary households.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They had a heartwarming meal with no weird atmosphere between them as there would be when a couple was together. After all, Qing Shui did not feel that way about her at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they eventually parted, Qing Shui noticed a hint of unwillingness in Xiang Bao's eyes. Qing Shui's interactions with her were extremely little and he did not understand why Xiang Bao was feeling this way towards him when they were meeting after three years. He shook his head, not willing to think too much about it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The day passed by just like that. Qing Shui decided to make a trip to Shi Clan the next day to see if he would be able to bring Shi Qingzhuang through the doors of Xiantian. After all, she was now a cultivator at the pinnacle of Houtian as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Because of Qing He's achievements, everyone in Qing Clan was extremely excited. Mingyue Gelou's breakthrough was because of her monstrous talent and was something that was useless for them to feel jealous about. But it was not the same of Qing He's case. It was like the light of dawn on darkness, an inspiring vigority.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he went back, it was already dark and they were about to have dinner. Qing Shui did not want to dampen their mood and thus joined them for dinner. It was very lively, and there was also Little Yuchang.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui started his cultivation upon entering the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, only recalling his Big Dipper Sword when he was cultivating his Thousand Hammer Technique, that Big Dipper Sword which had no attributes at all.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He could not help but recall that strong and mysterious divinity he felt back then. That strong and overwhelming divinity which he had taken the Big Dipper Sword from.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Could it be that this was a divine weapon left behind by gods? Could it be that this Big Dipper Sword is not as simple as it appears to be, an extremely heavy sword...?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui put down the Heaven Shaking Hammer in his hands and picked up the Big Dipper Sword. He planned to take time to go back to that place to see if he could have additional gains, but felt a great sense of helplessness when he thought about that strong and overwhelming pressure.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's good to take a look. I can at least take it as a chance to temper my muscles and bones with that pressure!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Sweeping his gaze towards the ten White Tiger Stones, Qing Shui thought of an idea. Maybe he should try applying "forging" on that Big Dipper Sword.There were two types of forging techniques in the Ancient Art of Forging.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The first one was to forge from the start, smelting, casting, tempering... It was the traditional way of forging!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Other than that, there was also another way of forging listed in the Ancient Art of Forging, which was to add on some other materials to the completed item, and then temper it with the Thousand Hammer Technique. It was like how he had done for the armors, battle boots, helmet and bangle to raise their grade to '2-color'.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This method did not exist in the world of the nine continents. There was only one forging opportunity for armors and weapons, and once completed, they could only be smelted and forged from the beginning in the future.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After thinking for a very long time, Qing Shui decided to try this out. In the worse case scenario, he would just have wasted those few pieces of White Tiger Stones. Qing Shui was not worried about damaging the Big Dipper Sword since the unique characteristic of this second method of forging would not damage the original object itself nor reduce their attributes or abilities.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was also why Qing Shui decided to give it a try. Another reason was because his forging level had already reached 2-color, and was almost reaching the great perfection stage for the 2-color grade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Taking out ten pieces of White Tiger Stones, Qing Shui first tempered them with the primordial flames. The greyish white White Tiger Stones turned into a milky white color, looking especially nice, exuding a gentle white glow.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Only now did Qing Shui feel that these were worthy to be called the White Tiger Stones, deserving of the spiritual Qi in them. Qing Shui lovingly played around with these White Tiger Stones which felt like white jade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As he did so, Qing Shui recalled a famous person from his previous life. That person's wife had extremely good skin, and the thing the person loved to do most was to undress his wife completely and placing a piece of white jade next to her. However, he could never make up his mind of which was superior, his wife's skin or the white jade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui returned the White Tiger Stones to their their original appearance which was like a piece of white jade, placing them in a row, looking at how they were emitting a soft glow. If it was in his previous life, he would be able to get an unimaginable sum of money from them if they were auctioned...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Creating another sword mold from the start, a mold that he could place the Big Dipper Sword in. He then tempered the Big Dipper Sword again with primordial flames. Qing Shui realized that the Big Dipper Sword could stand extremely high temperatures, but still, he did not dare to temper it for too long.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui placed the ten pieces of White Tiger Stones into the sword mold and then smelted them with primordial flames. It did not take long for all of the White Tiger Stones to become a milky white colored liquid.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then placed the Big Dipper Sword in the sword mold as well. The Big Dipper Sword was submerged in the liquid from the White Tiger Stones.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui then started to smelt with primordial flames again. The liquid from the White Tiger Stones gradually came to a boil, and then worked its way into the Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Time passed by very slowly. And although Qing Shui was worried that even the Big Dipper Sword would be melted as well, he then noticed that his current primordial flames were not able to melt the Big Dipper Sword. Feeling relieved, he increased the primordial flames, and the liquid from the White Tiger Stone bubbled even more ferociously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the last drop of liquid from the White Tiger Stone fused together with the Big Dipper Sword, Qing Shui quickly stretched out his left hand, circulating his "Saintly Hands", and the almost transparent left hand grabbed the Big Dipper Sword as Qing Shui moved towards the forging platform.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Waving the Heaven Shaking Hammer with his right hand, he started forging this Big Dipper Sword which had now turned into a milky white color!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Ding ding ding...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Loud sounds of metals clashing together rang out. It was just that no one was able to see this scene. The ancient and unsophisticated feeling emitted by the Heaven Shaking Hammer was stronger than ever, and each hammer was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The color of the milky white Big Dipper Sword slowly dissipated together with Qing Shui's hammerings, returning to its formal color.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The speed at which Qing Shui was hammering was not fast, and the gap between each hammer was exactly the same. The Heaven Shaking Hammer would land on the Big Dipper Sword without any delay.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This time around, Qing Shui did not know how many times he had hammered, nor did he know how many rounds of tempering he had gone through. This time, it was as if he had completely exceeded his knowledge of the Ancient Art of Forging completely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the radiant light glowed, Qing Shui squinted his eyes to look at the Big Dipper Sword which had resumed its original form. It looked exactly like before, but Qing Shui knew that the Big Dipper Sword had undergone an earth shattering transformation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It had become more dignified and magnificent than before...</p>
