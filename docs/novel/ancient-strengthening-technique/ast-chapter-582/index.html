 <p><strong>AST 582 - Nourishing the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb with poison! It really is the Demon Binding Ropes</strong></p>
 <p>“Why are you calling me master again? Do you really wish for me to get married so badly?” There was an indescribable emotion in Yiye Jiange’s eyes as she was looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“No no, I don’t want you to get married… Not that I want you…” This was the first time Qing Shui got stuck with his words. He felt really anxious, to the point he started sweating.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled when she saw Qing Shui’s reaction “I’m fine, you don’t have to feel so nervous. Just tell me whatever is on your mind. I know that you are doing this for my own good.”</p>
 <p>“I feel that master, deep down, you are a really lonely person. And I think that there are a lot of things that master has been keeping to herself not knowing who to talk to as well. That’s why I believe that master will feel a lot happier if you are in love with a person.” Qing Shui felt really exhausting when he said all of these, so much so that even the way he structured his sentence sounded really awkward. Despite that, he still managed to confess his feelings.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have anyone I like at the moment……” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui. Though there was a trace of joy across her face, her expression was somewhat indescribable.</p>
 <p>“Master, until you find yourself a man you like, why don’t you let me take care of you? You don’t have to treat me like a friend. You can treat me like your brother, just like I’m a part of your family. I can give you everything that I have.” Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange and said with a serious expression. Within his clear and tranquil eyes lay a kind of indescribable persistence.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled. Her smile looked really perfect as she extended her hand and rubbed Qing Shui’s head: “Alright! It’s a deal!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got infected by her smile and gave a simple and honest smile as well. At this moment, he felt unusually relaxed as if he just let go of an extremely heavy load.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw a glimmer of hope. As it turned out, the only thing left which he was unable to let go of was emotions. The only way for him to loosen up completely wasn’t to be cold and ruthless, but instead show more kindness and compassion. Just as if he possessed the heart of a newborn baby, pure and innocent.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After he returned to the Qing Clan, he immediately headed to the backyard. It was only noon. The two elderly men were drinking tea and talking to each other in the pavilion. Other than practicing the Taichi Fist, Qing Luo basically spent his remaining time on cultivating his ethics. He hardly cultivated physically. Since he didn’t really run into anything major throughout his life, his cultivation level stopped at Xiantian Realm.</p>
 <p>When Lin Zhanhan and Qing Luo saw Qing Shui came back, they both felt relieved, “You are back! Did everything go on smoothly?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it’s just as Grandpa Lin said. The Diamond Elephant managed to deal with them all alone.” Qing Shui smiled as he informed them about the good news.</p>
 <p>“How are the two little brats?” Qing Luo asked in concern. About Luan Luan, the entire Qing Clan basically thought that she was Qing Shui’s blood-related daughter. Besides, it was no longer of any importance whether she was blood-related or not. Most importantly, they cared for her a lot.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, they’re totally fine!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the news about Hundred Clan War Barracks being eliminated by Qing Shui of the Heavenly Palace spread around the entire Green Cloud Continent. Not only did he cripple the entire Hundred Clan War Barracks alone, he even managed to eliminate Zhan Clan. At the same time, everyone was also aware that Zhan Clan had Martial Saint grade warriors. Despite that, Qing Shui still managed to eliminate them.</p>
 <p>Then, for quite a while, the entire continent was abuzz with these kinds of news. Word of, Qing Shui’s Demonic Beasts, that Qing Shui was a Martial Saint warrior, and also whether there were anymore Martial Saint warriors hiding within the Green Cloud Continent.</p>
 <p>The World of the Nine Continents put a lot of emphasis on one’s capability to fight. Hence, people would often be more concerned of who survived, who died, and what kind of strength the warriors possessed. They wouldn’t really care much about who was right and who was wrong. This time however, the Hundred Clan War Barracks was in the wrong. Not only did they deserve this kind of fate, they were still accused by thousands of people even after their demise.</p>
 <p>The winner always had the freedom of speech. They could say whatever they want without anyone’s interruption. Besides, not only was everything regarding the incident this time the truth, it was even from Four Seas Country. Even the people who survived too didn’t dare to talk nonsense.</p>
 <p>For a moment, all of the well-known sects and clans in Green Cloud Continent finally acknowledged the Heavenly Palace to be the strongest sect in Green Cloud Continent. At the the same time, Qing Clan was also considered to have squeezed into one of the top clans in Green Cloud Continents.</p>
 <p>All because Qing Shui was from Qing Clan. It’s just as one said “once a man gets a government position, all his cronies will get in too.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At night, Qing Shui quietly left after Canghai Mingyue fell asleep. It’s just that every time he left, Canghai Mingyue would open her eyes and smile watching him leaving carefully.</p>
 <p>Inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He has already wasted two days time to go into the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Sacrificing two days time for the two little brats were nothing to him. But if there wasn’t anything important, Qing Shui would feel really reluctant to let even one day slip.</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, he cultivated a cycle of Ancient Strengthening Technique. His injuries were also almost recovered. He picked up the Demonic Beast’s tendon which looked a lot like a Demon Binding Rope.</p>
 <p>Refine it and nourish it!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t add in any other things because this was undoubtedly a strong Demonic Beast’s tendon. In fact, he even felt that it was too good for the Demonic Beast’s ingredients which he had at the moment.</p>
 <p>That was why Qing Shui eventually made up his mind to refine this Beast’s tendon with his own qi. He wanted to see if it really was the Demon Binding Rope.</p>
 <p>He constantly channelled in his Nature Energy and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique only to find that it was quickly blocked. However, with his Nature Energy around, it was still able to move forward but at a significantly reduced speed. Despite that, he could still clearly feel it gradually moving forward.</p>
 <p>Diamond Qi!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui strengthened his Qi to get it to flow a bit faster. As he looked at the length of this Beast’s tendon, he knew that it wasn’t something which would be done within a day. But with the heaven defying Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it could be said that the most precious time itself had become a very normal thing.</p>
 <p>The length of this Beast’s tendon was about twenty meters. It was as thick as a baby’s arm. As he examined it, he felt that it was average in size. After about half a day, he managed to get access to about two metres of it. Qing Shui was quite satisfied with it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stopped and practiced his Back Connecting Fist and the Thousand Hammer Technique which was almost at the state of One with Heaven. After that, he strolled around the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>There were already almost ten thousand Rainbow Trout Fish even though ninety nine percent of them was still immature. Despite that, they were already the size which was edible. The Crystal Lions were also swimming happily inside the pond. The little animals looked really delicate and valiant. Even the Rainbow Trout Fish didn’t dare to pick on them.</p>
 <p>During this time, Qing Shui collected yet another two crystals meaning he possessed four of it in total. It could be said that they were already worth a fortune. However, since there were yet to be any suitable medicinal pills to match it, he could only keep these expensive stuffs for now.</p>
 <p>“Huh? The Triple-Eyed Grass Green Frog has already laid eggs?” Qing Shui saw two Triple-eyed Grass Green Frogs protecting an egg. He felt really agitated because the egg which it laid had a really similar effect to the crystal which the Crystal Lions laid. It’s just that it wasn’t as strong as the crystal. However, it had the upper hand in terms of quantity.</p>
 <p>He looked around and noticed the fiery seed which he got from the Wolf King Hall in Flowerfruit Mountain. He was shocked to find out that the fiery grass which was originally the size of a finger had grown from the original one inch to the current two inches after a long time. It looked even more fiery red and was exuding an extremely hot aura. There was a layer of weak, red light surrounding it. It looked even more like a layer of flame.</p>
 <p>“Just what is this?” At present, Qing Shui could tell that it was a kind of grass. But it was totally different from all the plants Qing Shui previously came across. Furthermore, the powerful spiritual fluctuation that was emitting out of it also made him aware that it was something with considerable value.</p>
 <p>“I have time to wait!” Qing Shui looked at the small grass and was filled with hope.</p>
 <p>The 1000-year Gloomy Wood still looked the same except it now had even thicker branches and leaves. Qing Shui was really curious to know what this was.</p>
 <p>Just like usual, everyday only one Peach of Immortality could be produced. But since the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal upgraded, the time needed for it would also be considerably shorter. The Flower of Life still looked the same as well. It would need a bit of time for it to blossom, but now it could help save thirty percent of the time for the medicinal herbs and plants to grow.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui looked at all of these, he felt really satisfied. It wouldn’t really make sense if he gave these precious things to other people because it was impossible for the others to have the insane Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>He also collected quite a lot of Plum Blossoms. He had been leaving it be ever since he used all of it to replace the Snow Melted Wood. As for other things such as the Vermillion Fruits, Qing Shui brought all of them together. It was really hard for him to make anymore improvements since he had reached a state of saturation. The only thing he could do was to wait for himself to break through to the Sixth Heavenly Layer.</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui walked towards the small pond far away. That place was completely filled with poisonous things such as the Poisonous Mamba, Scarlet Turtle, Tricolor Toads and Poisonous Jellyfish.</p>
 <p>There was a Bloody Lotus floating on the surface of the water and Heartbroken Grass growing at the corner of the pond.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui glanced towards the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb in the distance. After that, he looked at the poisonous substances in the water. Since he had nothing to do, he decided to refine the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb with poison.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of ways to refine poisonous substances recorded inside the . The best method was to refine the entire toxic substance in order to extract the essence within it. This could help raise the toxicity to the extreme. It’s just that due to the rarity of some of the poisonous objects, people would normally choose to not use a method which was like killing chickens to get their eggs.</p>
 <p>For poisonous animals like scorpions and wasps, their poisons were all collected from their tails. Whereas for toads and turtles, it was collected from their mouth. The method recorded in the was really unique. Normally, it would take about a month for them to recover the poison which was collected from them.</p>
 <p>The Scarlet Turtle, Poisonous Mamba and Tricolor Toads were more commonly encountered in the Stellar Horse Lake. There were very few of these poisonous creatures in other places. Luckily, Qing Shui managed to catch quite a lot of them. For now, they had even reproduced quite a lot in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>These things were still a bit inferior to the poisonous substances with more than five colors. Adding on that there was quite a huge amount of it now, Qing Shui decided to use the most straightforward way to extract the poisons.</p>
 <p>Refine!</p>
 <p>The toxicity of the substances also put a lot of emphasis on its allocation. Otherwise, a situation of fighting fire with fire would occur and the toxicity would be cancelled out. Hence, matching poisons was also something which needed to be given particular attention to. If it properly succeeded, the toxicity would increase significantly.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Qing Shui settled down with the Bloody Lotus, Scarlet Turtle, Poisonous Jellyfish. He took out twenty of each except for Bloody Lotus. He got fifty of them. He used the Primordial Refining Furnace for the refining process. By relying on a Divine Artifact, the toxicity should also be able to be strengthened further.</p>
 <p>He refined the outer shell, the muscles, and the bones while keeping the poisonous sack. After that, he fused them.</p>
 <p>Since it was his first time refining it, Qing Shui followed each steps stated in the carefully. After all, the things he used were all in top quality. Primal Chaotic Flame, Primal Chaotic Primordial Refining Furnace. Qing Shui also only noticed later on when he was at the Stellar Horse Lake that it was quite easy for him to refine materials. Even though he didn’t believe in things like recognizing owners from dropping blood. However, ever since he dropped his blood in the Primordial Refining Furnace, he felt that the link established between him and it became a lot stronger.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Qing Shui slowly opened up both of his eyes only to be pleasantly surprised. To think that his first time would go on so smoothly! He hurriedly looked towards the Primal Chaotic Primordial Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>There was a dark black liquid at the bottom of the furnace which was around one metre wide. It looked slightly denser than water and didn’t smell as bad as he thought it would. However, it would give people goosebumps.</p>
 <p>On the surface of the black liquid, there was a layer of substance which looked like a kind of vapor.</p>
 <p>He ate some food and rested for a while. After he recovered his qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, he proceeded to refine the Beast’s tendon. This was because once the venom was successfully refined, it would need to be cooled down in order to make the toxicity more stable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took out the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb after a day in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and walked to the side of the Primordial Refining Furnace.</p>
 <p>Chi-chi…...</p>
 <p>A noise which sounded like fire getting splashed by water rang. Qing Shui saw the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb collecting the poisonous fluid in the Primordial Refining Furnace like a greedy child.</p>
 <p>The spiderweb of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb slowly turned even darker and glossy while the poisonous fluid became less and less. Qing Shui extended his hand and pressed against the Primordial Refining Furnace. After that, he slowly channelled in his Nature Energy and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique.</p>
 <p>Chi-chi…..</p>
 <p>The Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb which had initially slowed down its absorption speed once again gave out a kind of noise. At the same time, the poisonous fluid was also becoming more and more little.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only stopped when there wasn’t any poisonous fluid left in the Primordial Refining Furnace. He took up the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb which looked even darker and brighter than before and couldn’t wait to try it out against a Demonic Beast.</p>
 <p>Refine!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui toughened the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb with his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, it started giving out bright light. Furthermore, a faint coldness also started spreading out into the surrounding.</p>
 <p>After getting everything done, Qing Shui couldn’t find any Demonic Beasts to try the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb on. Hence, he could only wait until next time to try it out. These kind of poisonous substances had to be nourished with poison. Normally, it was done once a year. Or else, it would be a waste of poison if they failed to absorb it.</p>
 <p>The huge improvement in strength, the powerful Diamond Gigantic Elephant along with Qing Shui’s Tiger Form and Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint which have reached a frightening level. This was the first time in life when Qing Shui felt really secured. He slowly felt more and more relaxed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui spent most of his remaining time in the realm toughening the Beast’s tendon . The more he progressed, the more he felt its speed getting slower and slower. What made Qing Shui felt relieved was that despite being slow, it was still advancing forward. At present, there were only three meters left.</p>
 <p>“Fuck, it still came……”</p>
 <p>When there were only two meters remaining, Qing Shui surged it forward three times in a row only to fail again and again.</p>
 <p>As he once again attempted to surge forward a few times, he spotted the Violet Gold Divine Shield by accident. He thought to himself: “How could I have forgotten about it!”</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>Pu!</p>
 <p>A loud and clear explosive sound rang out. After that, Qing Shui had a feeling which resembled the great rivers flowing into the sea with his Divine Force. The last meter was exactly like a bottomless pit.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Qing Shui’s Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique was strong and solid. He adjusted its speed to an optimum rate to make sure that the qi which was revolving on its own could replenish constantly because he felt that it would be inappropriate to give up halfway.</p>
 <p>Qianggg!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the “Beast’s tendon” gave out a bright and dazzling golden light. It was accompanied by a dragon roaring noise. At the same time when Qing Shui felt astonished, he spotted the Jade Emperor Bees returning to their nest on the Hundred Blossom Tree.</p>
 <p>Ming!</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>At the same time, both the Fire Bird and Diamond Gigantic Elephant also gave out a loud and clear scream as they seemingly tried to withstand the formidable pressure.</p>
