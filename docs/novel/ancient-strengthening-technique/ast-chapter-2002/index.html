 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui returned to the Imperial Cuisine Hall, it was already noon. Everyone saw Qing Shui and the others came back. In fact, many people had no idea what was going on. When the Jade Fragrant Restaurant's owner told Qing Shui about the matter, Qing Shui didn’t tell the others as he didn't want them to worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the others had no idea of what had just happened. However, they'd already found out that something big had happened in the Great Shang City—the Sacred Medicine Palace—had been wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there were only rumors outside that the Sacred Medicine Palace was wiped out, but no one said who had done it. However, Qing Shui knew that it wouldn't be long before the news would be spread out. It was because forces at the level of the Shang Clan and Lang Clan would definitely know how the Sacred Medicine Palace had been wiped out. Moreover, there was another person who knew the most about this matter, and was also the first to find out about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jade Fragrant Restaurant's owner!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, it hadn't been long before that woman came. When she saw Qing Shui, her beautiful eyes shone in great surprise, but she still smiled. It was as if she felt relieved to see him. She nodded toward Qing Shui, "You're back!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt very comfortable to know that she was worried about him. He smiled and walked over, "I have to thank you this time around."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister Qing is standing on ceremony. When the Imperial Cuisine Hall first opened, I had the great fortune to eat such delicious foods. I have a great liking toward good foods. When will the Imperial Cuisine Hall start to sell such delicacies to the public? Will I be able to buy them in the future?" The lady asked happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled. He knew that the lady was interested in those foods of his. He smiled and said, "As of now, I don't know when I can start selling them. Those foods rely on a certain type of spice. I can only tell you that this spice can only be grown in a unique place and such places aren't easy to find. I'll give you some of these spices. If you keep them for your own use, they'll last you for very long. They can last you for eight to ten years, or even several decades. However, if there are more people having them, then I won't be able to give any assurance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had quite a lot of these spices piled up in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He didn't wish to sell them and thus, only gave them to his friends and family. Moreover, these spices continued to mature and there was no need to worry that there wasn't enough supply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister QIng, I have a suggestion. I wonder if you'll be interested to hear it?" the lady smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh? What suggestion? Could it be that you want us to set up a restaurant together?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ah? You even know about this?" the lady said, a little embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qing Shui saw the lady's astonished expression, he felt a little happy. This lady was really beautiful. Although her disposition wasn't very seductive, it had a little innocence and a type of pure air to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her snow-white skin was like jade, smooth and flawless. She had a long and slender figure and was well-embodied. In addition to not having even a bit of excess fats, her chest was very well-rounded and so was her butt. It made her waist appear increasingly slender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an independent and mature lady who had a different charm. There was a hint of charm in her disposition. There was also a little arrogance as well as a bit of weakness and sluggishness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It can be done, but there's something I'm curious about and I am not sure if I can ask about it. After all, you've helped me and if I were to ask, it would seem a little..." Qing Shui said hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady was stunned for a moment. From Qing Shui's expression, it didn't seem as if he was trying to suggest something. She smiled and said, "That's not a problem. Go ahead and ask!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's go over there, shall we take a seat and have a chat?" Qing Shui pointed to a pavilion in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them sat in the pavilion. Qing Ci and Little Mo had returned. Qing Shui felt very relaxed; he personally made a pot of tea. This type of tea was also something which Qing Shui had planted in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and there was nothing to complain about its taste. Of course, it would be especially enjoyable for tea connoisseurs to drink it, but even people who didn't know how to appreciate tea would feel refreshed after drinking it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, anyone who drank this tea would like it. People said that good tea could make one feel refreshed and enlightened, awake, and more alert. Ordinary people could feel more energized and this feeling was very close to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady fell in love with the tea after a sip. She complimented the tea while looking at it. This man had too many surprises. Not only did he have great medical skills, but he was also very strong and had wiped out the Sacred Medicine Palace single-handedly. The Sacred Medicine Palace was a great sect, but it fell within half a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also had great delicacies and amazing tea. She wondered what else did he know? What was his identity? and what was his purpose of coming to the Great Shang City? His purpose shouldn't be to set up a medical hall. After all, someone of his cultivation would definitely be one of the tops in the Great Shang City. He shouldn't be lacking in money and thus, shouldn't be eyeing for something here. What was his reason to come here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Miss, your Jade Fragrant Restaurant should be a force that gathers information, or rather, probes for information, right?" Qing Shui finally asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I knew that you'd ask about this. You've already found out." The lady wasn't surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Is our cooperation just to set up a restaurant?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lady now knew why this man had stayed here. She knew that some of the young men in his Imperial Cuisine Hall had been cultivating incessantly. This man was one with an ambition. He seemed to be lying low and developing now. This was a chance. Thinking to this, the lady was overjoyed, but she didn't show anything on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then what else does Mister Qing wish to work together on?" The lady looked at Qing Shui and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sigh, I'm not afraid to let you know, but my goal isn't this place. My goal is in the True Nine Continents World. You should know about it, but I have no idea how much understanding you have toward the Nine Continents World. Or rather, do you have the intentions of entering the True Nine Continents World?" Qing Shui didn't hide this. It wasn't a secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I do know a little about the Nine Continents World. Moreover, I also wished to let the Jade Fragrant Restaurant enter the Nine Continents World. Oh right, my intelligence network doesn't have an owner yet. We don't report to anyone at the moment." The lady smiled and looked at Qing Shui, blinking her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's heart kept beating quicker and he almost couldn't hold the urge to hug her. When a mature lady with some charm, sexiness, arrogance, sluggishness, and fragile feelings revealed such a cute and sexy expression, wasn't it a bait for one to commit a crime?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled awkwardly as the lady's expression went back to normal. However, she was still maintaining a slight smile. Earlier on, she could also tell that Qing Shui's expression was a little scoundrelly, and she could also see the greed that Qing Shui had toward her at that moment. This greed didn't seem to be a blatant one. His gaze was very clear, full of admiration and like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn't feel repulsed toward him. Or rather, it was because her opinion of him was already different, to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's great. I wonder if you're willing to work together with me alone." Qing Shui quickly asked.</span></p>

Do you have to be so direct? How do you expect me to reply you like this? If I were to ask you to give me three days to consider, will you be angry?" The lady smiled and asked.</span></p>

I'm called Yu Xixuan." She reached out her tender hand as she said this.</span></p>

There should have been some forces who would want to work together with you." Qing Shui asked, puzzled.</span></p>

Would you believe me if I was to say that I'm not interested in these forces in the Great Shang City and don't wish to work together with them?"</span></p>

Seems like Xixuan's eyes are very bright and have a good judgment. You can tell that I'm a person with great qualities." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>

Yu Xixuan looked at Qing Shui who seemed a little smug at the moment and smiled. “It seemed that this guy was also quite humorous.” thought Xixuan.</span></p>
