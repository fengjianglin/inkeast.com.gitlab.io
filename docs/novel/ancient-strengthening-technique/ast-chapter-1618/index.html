 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yin did not suffer much injuries, but she appeared a little disheartened when she walked up to Qing Shui. No matter what, one wouldn't feel happy over a loss. Her eyes appeared a little red when she looked at Qing Shui, "Father, am I a disappointment?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled and took his daughter's hand, "Foolish lass. Your father's greatest pride is this family. All of you are my pride."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But I lost!" Although Qing Yin was a little aloof from worldly affairs, she was still eager to do well. This was also what that set the difference between her and Qing Yan. Other than some martial techniques that Qing Shui had made it compulsory for her to learn, Qing Yan would spend all of her free time on drawing, music, and other activities. She was very happy. Qing Shui did not force any one of his children. Qing Yan's character was not suited for battle and he only made her cultivate the necessary techniques in order to strengthen her body and increase her lifespan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yin smiled and hugged Qing Shui. She had a strong attachment to her father. Although they had not spent a lot of time together when she was young, his presence as her father had always been very clear. Her father doted on daughters over sons as he said that it was good to pamper on daughters more and to beat sons up more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had not actually beaten up these kids before, but when he was talking sense into them, he would also give them some benefits, especially when it was to his daughters. As long as they bring things up and he was able to satisfy them, he would do it. As the saying went, sons should be bred up with a poor lifestyle and daughters with a rich lifestyle. He inculcated in his children the viewpoint of life and of the world that was most suitable to the general masses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, all of his children had grown up. Qing Shui would occasionally feel as if he was in a dream. He was still considered to be very young in this world and other people of his age tend to not have set up their own family yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not have any regrets. It did not matter whether he started one early or later. He felt that this was the best way to do things. He held onto one of his daughter's hand. Qing Yu also came over and took Qing Shui's other hand, smiling like a little fox.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass, what's the matter? Why are you smiling like that?" When Qing Shui saw Qing Yu's smile, it was as if he saw Huoyun Liu-Li instead. Qing Yu was very alike to Huoyun Liu-Li, both in appearance and in character as well, full of funny ideas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father, look. That's Baima Clan. That girl is Baima Clan's Young Miss. Your son has already gotten into her good books." Qing Yu smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt very helpless. He followed Qing Yu's gaze to Baima Clan and saw that girl as well. she was a girl that was like snow, appearing to be very quiet. She seemed to be more mature than other kids her age. Her gaze was clear and serene, with a hint of indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui's first impression of this girl was good. It was no wonder that his son likes her. Right now, Qing Shui was feeling doubtful if Qing Ming had intentionally wanted to make the Nalan Clan feel repulse. From the past, this son of his would do similar things, but it was when his character had not taken any shape yet. Although his character was not completely formed, at the very least, it was much better than before, having developed a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father, Qing Ming lied. He really likes that Young Miss from Baima Clan."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ming wasn't there. He had returned to his room to rest, Otherwise, he would definitely be anxious and stop Qing Yu. When Qing Shui heard this, he laughed, "He seems to often like other people!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Father's clever. It's really the case. However, this time around, it's the longest thus far. It seems to be for real this time." Qing Yu chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By this time, the battle on the arena had already started. However, there was nothing to watch, because Luan Luan had already struck Nalan Chi off the arena with a single blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't surprised at all. Luan Luan's abilities weren’t something that people of her generation could hope to be a match for. Then, three others went up consecutively. They were all amongst the strongest amongst Nalan Clan's younger generation. However, there was still no suspense. Not a single one of them could hold off more than three moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one else from the Nalan Clan went up anymore. They would be putting themselves through humiliation. Nalan Clan's elders could tell that this young girl from the Qing Clan was not only powerful but also had plenty of battle experience as well. She was not someone others from her generation could go up against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Clan could not accept this outcome. They knew that this girl from the Qing Clan was their last representative. There was one last person from the Nalan Clan who was suitable for this fight. It was the youngest brother of their clan's head. He was close to 70 years old. Although he seemed very young, he was also very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this guy went up, many people gasped. It was because Nalan Zhengming was widely known. He was not from the younger generation and instead, was eight to ten years older than those of this generation. He looked just like how people from Qing Shui's previous life would be at the age of 27 or 28 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nalan Clan is really shameless. To think that they sent someone of higher seniority to participate in a battle amongst the younger generation. If they can't afford to lose, then they shouldn't be participating."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do they really think that just because he looks younger, he is considered to be one of the younger generations? I've seen a lot of shameless people, but I haven't seen any who are this shameless."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This Nalan Zhengming is also considered to be one of the younger generations. He is the youngest amongst the Nalan clan head's and is only three years older than the eldest in Nalan Clan's younger generation."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If your uncle isn't older than you, are you planning on getting him to address you as uncle?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who spoke up previously was forced to eat up his words and kept quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm Nalan Zhengming. Can I take part?" Nalan Zhengming smiled and said to Luan Luan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan looked at Nalan Zhengming, "There aren't any other people from the Nalan Clan. Don't you think that it's even more humiliating for you to be stepping out?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan was also a little devil herself when she was young. Qing Shui knew that she wouldn't lose out. Therefore, he had not made any move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Although I'm not from the Nalan Clan's younger generation, my age isn't that much older compared to them. When I'm outside, I also hang out with people of your generation as well." Nalan Zhengming was not infuriated, but instead, spoke with great demeanour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm actually not too willing to be with others from my generation. It's because they're a little young." What Luan Luan said seemed a little like a slap in the face, but Nalan Zhengming was caught off guard and wasn't sure what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If you really wish to have a fight, I'll give it to you. If you were to lose, Nalan Clan would be completely humiliated." Luan Luan kept on giving Nalan Zhengming pressure. Under great pressure, most people would perform poorly and only a small minority would explode under pressure and unleash extraordinary abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Nalan Clan can afford to lose. Moreover, the younger generation's abilities can't be a representative of the clan's abilities. What do you think? " Nalan Zhengming tried to change the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What does it mean for the clan's future if there aren't any successors? If there isn’t anyone to succeed the Nalan Clan, who would view the Nalan Clan in high regard?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan was a little too vicious with this statement. What did she mean by there being no successors? It was not as if the Nalan Clan did not have any descendants. To a cultivator, for the juniors to be useless, it would mean that they did not have any successors. Luan Luan's words essentially labelled the juniors from the Nalan Clan as being useless. Moreover, they had been badly beaten up by Qing Clan's juniors. It would be very hard for them to get rid of this label within a short period of time.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luan Luan smiled and nodded. A token that was like a sword appeared in her hand. Qing Shui took a look and saw that it was the Beast King Medallion which he had given to her in the past. He hadn't expected that it would become Luan Luan's weapon now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nalan Zhengming wasn't someone those from the younger generation could compare with. He was considered very strong. It was a pity that he met Luan Luan. Luan Luan didn't wish to waste her time with him and immediately called out her many demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Earth Devouring Mice, Mystic-Armored Ice Ox, Spirit Deer, Heavenly Fire-Armored Rock Bear, and many others appeared. They then charged out toward Nalan Zhengming under everyone's astonished gazes. Luan Luan wasn't only a powerful cultivator but was also a powerful Beast Tamer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The demonic beasts that Luan Luan called out were very powerful. After all, over these years, these demonic beasts had grown to a terrifying level from the many medicinal pills and their own progress. However, Luan Luan didn't call out her strongest demonic beast. She felt that Nalan Zhengming was not worthy of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really wasn't. By the time one could drink half a cup of tea, Nalan Zhengming had already lost. Nalan Clan was truly humiliated thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lass, that's enough. You can come down now. If the elders from the Nalan Clan wish to spar, I'll take them on." Qing Shui spoke out softly, but his voice rang out for very far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Luan Luan heard Qing Shui's words, she came down happily. She had already grown up and was close to 30 years of age. However, before Qing Shui, she was still the young lass from back then. She walked up to Qing Shui and called out, "Father!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only one change from before. Luan Luan now had her own blood-related father and mother, and they were together. However, in her heart, Qing Shui would forever be her father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui pat her on the head out of habit. Luan Luan smiled happily, "I really missed my childhood days when Father would bring me around, carry me, and play with me."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You aren't allowed to go back on your words."</span></p>

The sounds of discussions in the surroundings turned softer. The elderly man looked around and said, smiling, "Everyone knows that our Nalan Clan and the Baima Clan are becoming in-laws, but someone from the Qing Clan went to harass the fiancee of a member of our Nalan Clan. They even beat up our people. If our Nalan Clan let this through, how would people see our Nalan Clan? Even though the Qing Clan's younger generation is outstanding, they shouldn't be bullying others."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way the elderly man put it, it wasn't slandering the Qing Clan. What he said made sense. He knew that Qing Clan would definitely not say that someone from the Nalan Clan had slandered Qing Yin, and thus he put things this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Toward vile people, as well as people who were not brought up well, giving them a beating is for their own good. Not only are you guys not thankful that someone else has helped you to teach them, but instead, stood up for them. Don't you know that this will make them lose the desire to improve themselves? It's fine for kids to be beaten up. They just need to put in effort and return the favor. It might not be a bad thing for them. You guys are already getting on in age, are you able to take of them forever? If you have the time, you should be teaching them good stuff and not just teach them how to slander people behind their backs and spread rumors." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elderly man's face flushed a little, but he quickly regained his composure. "I'm issuing a challenge to the Qing Clan. If someone from the Qing Clan is able to defeat me, I'll apologize and admit my mistake. If Qing Clan loses, I hope that the Qing Clan will apologize as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could tell the elderly man's abilities. He wasn't weak. How weak could he be when he had managed to force the Phoenix Dance Amalgamation to disband? However, to Qing Shui, it was very easy for him to defeat the elderly man. After all, the elderly man was still a far cry from Peak False God cultivators like those from the Sea Dragon Palace and the Sunset Palace. They weren't at the same level at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can promise you that. However, regardless who turns out to be the winner, the loser must agree to one condition that the winner raises." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Could it be any condition?" the elderly man also smiled and asked.</span></p>
