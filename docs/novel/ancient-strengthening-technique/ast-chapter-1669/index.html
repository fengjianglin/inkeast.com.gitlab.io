 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them hugged each other for very long. They said that when God created humans, one man and one woman would make up a whole. When they were reborn, they would split apart. Then, each pair which made up one whole would slowly comb through the crowd for each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Qing Shui seemed to feel as if he had found his other half. This was an indescribable feeling and the strangest thing was that he seemed to sense that Tantai Lingyan was also feeling the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very long later, Tantai Lingyan slowly pushed away Qing Shui, wearing a slight smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Did I go too far? You won't be blaming me after this, right?" Qing Shui smiled and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What would I blame you for?" Tantai Lingyan seemed to not have understood Qing Shui's words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Blame me for not kissing you and things like that..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan quickly turned and left while Qing Shui hastily followed after her. He noticed that she wasn't angry but only a little embarrassed. Tantai Lingyan knew that things would turn out this way. The more this man was more relaxed around her, the more audacious he would become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she still didn't feel really angry and felt that it was very normal, with no repulsive feelings. On the contrary, she felt that it was very endearing. Tantai Lingyan shook her head. There was only one explanation for why she would feel like this. Her heart had already accepted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old turtle came back very soon. Earlier on, he had said that he'd go and make some preparations. However, it seemed as if he hadn't prepared anything at all. Qing Shui smiled, "Let's head back. I'm very hungry. We'll return and make some good food to enjoy together."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They went directly back to the Linhai City's Imperial Cuisine Hall. Both Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng hadn't come out from their seclusion. Most people would train in seclusion in order to attain a breakthrough at their current level. Therefore, it usually wouldn't take too long unless there was some kind of special circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qin Qing saw Tantai Lingyan, she was clearly stunned. Her spiritual sense was very amazing and she could tell that Tantai Lingyan had undergone a tremendous change. She smiled and first looked at Qing Shui then at Tantai Lingyan, "Sister Lingyan, you've attained a breakthrough."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan took Qin Qing's hand and nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing felt very happy. She wasn't a narrow-minded person and she enjoyed seeing Tantai Lingyan getting stronger. After all, when Tantai Lingyan got more powerful, it would also be very beneficial to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ziche Sha and Ling Fei were a far cry in comparison. They couldn't tell that Tantai Lingyan had already attained a breakthrough. However, the sudden appearance of the old turtle who had undergone a Form Transformation had caused everyone to be greatly astonished once again. After all, there was already the case of Long Zhu`er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, with the first case with Long Zhu`er, the old turtle undergoing the Form Transformation wasn't as great of a blow. Despite so, everyone was still taken aback quite considerably. They knew that the old turtle was now also a Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the old turtle now being a Divinity, Ziche Sha and Ling Fei could both try to guess Tantai Lingyan's cultivation. However, neither of them had asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had lunch together. There were clearly more ladies than men at the table. There was originally Lan Lingfeng and Yin Tong, but now, there was only Qing Shui and the old turtle. The old turtle was a senior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn't a need to hide the matters concerning Tantai Lingyan. Therefore, Qing Shui told them Tantai Lingyan's current abilities and helped her to tell everyone that the Demon Lord Palace would be shifted to the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This decision had already been made. Although it might not be that the entire Demon Lord Palace would be shifted here, since there were so many people, at least a small group or even half of them would shift over. This would need to take some time. They would first need to select a location and get some construction and stuff settled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days later, both Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng came out from their seclusion. They were both now at Peak False God level. They had improved tremendously. They were naturally very happy to see Qing Shui and gave him a great hug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng had the Battle God Inheritance, but it was a pity that they were both still a little weak at the current moment. They would still need some more time before they could catch up, though their progress was slowly getting faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three men also had a lot to say and prepared a table of food, chatting as they ate. Their relationship had gotten a lot closer with the test of time. It was all because of the Battle God Inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng knew that Tantai Lingyan and the old turtle were both Divinities, they were both shocked and pleasantly surprised. This time around, they had gotten a lot of benefits from going into training in seclusion. However, they were still a far cry from Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui gave each of them a Diamond Fruit, not in the hope that it would give them more power. The benefits of Sacred Fruits were not just limited to increasing one's strength, but also improving their physique, as well as the flexibility and other aspects of their meridian channels and internal organs. It could help them improve their foundations even further and it would be even easier for them to tide through the False God Tribulation and Divine Tribulation in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't have enough Diamond Fruits on him at the moment. Otherwise, he would give one each to the people around him. Right now, he could only give them to people who needed them at the current moment. As time passed, they would all get one each.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them couldn't wait and consumed the Diamond Fruit directly, putting aside the wine. Neither of them attained a breakthrough to the Divine Grade. This was within Qing Shui's expectation. If they were to attain a breakthrough, then Qing Shui would feel that it's not normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The matter with the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider was already a huge surprise and Qing Shui couldn't explain this. A situation like this was extremely rare and there might not even be another occurrence in 100 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, both of them improved tremendously. However, compared to Qin Qing, they were still slightly weaker. It wasn't a lot but they still had gotten a lot stronger. This time around, the improvement they had received were more in the area of their meridian channels and internal organs, having their bodies tempered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Yin Tong and Lan Lingfeng were very surprised. They were now considered to be only steps away from the Divine Grade. Of course, this was a very difficult section and was hard to cross if they didn't come across any fortunate encounters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The days went by peacefully as Qing Shui continued to temper his body relentlessly. Amongst his demonic beasts, the Dark Phoenix and Long Zhu`er were the strongest and they were still stabilizing their powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast was still the same with terrifying abilities. However, it had a restriction and if it was alone, it wouldn't be able to unleash too great of a damaging prowess. In the future, it might be able to create one that would bring about absolute massacres.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Dragon Slaying Beasts, speed was absolute power. WIth absolute speed, everything else wouldn’t be a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was a Heaven and Earth Battle Beast. However, it had now been overtaken by both the Hellfire Phoenix and the Nine-Headed Demonic Dragon Spider. Even so, Qing Shui still held the greatest hope for the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. It would just be a matter of time before it reached the Divine Grade.</span></p>

It was able to instantly turn the tables around in certain situations and it wasn't weak either.</span></p>

These two were a great surprise. Furthermore, Tantai Lingyan and the old turtle had also attained a breakthrough. Tantai Lingyan was inseparable from Qin Qing and could help to take care of this place. Very soon, the Demon Lord Palace would be moved here too.</span></p>

Qing Shui was now less worried about the Sunset Palace. The people around Qing Shui were slowly rising up. This was a beginning.</span></p>

After all, it was a very long journey from the False God level to the Divine level. Of course, the ladies around him weren't ordinary existences either.</span></p>
