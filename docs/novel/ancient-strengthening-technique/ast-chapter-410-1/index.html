 <p><strong>Chapter 410 Because you are my sister, the old man from the Qing Clan’s hidden library.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 410 - Because you are my sister, the old man from the Qing Clan’s hidden library</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Guo Yanglong’s wife, who was Guo Polu’s mother, was an attractive woman for her age. She had a full figure and no young lass could compete with the gracefulness in her face. Her beauty could rival that of the woman from Xiao Clan whom he killed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No wonder Guo Yanglong only had one wife. She must have a way with her hands,” Qing Shui thought to himself as he could not help but wonder about the woman’s charm.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui chatted and drank. There was a big drinking party as they discussed the massacres on the Central continent or about demonic beasts. The conversations were mostly of a violent variety.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, on Qing Yi’s side, Madam Guo was talking to her about her son, Qing Qing and Qing Shui. She told Qing Yi that she was fortunate to have a good son and daughter.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Most of the time, however, she was talking about Qing Qing and Guo PoLu. Apparently, Guo PoLu did not hide his feelings from his mother as she was able to easily see how he felt. After all, what he did for Qing Qing made it very obvious.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Previously, there was no way to bring that up. &nbsp;Actually, talking about it now will also bring controversies. Things have already changed for Qing Clan and Qing Qing was no longer that girl who was abandoned by the Yan Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you must stay longer this time. Yourself, Qing Qing, Qingyou and PoLu are all young people. Everyone should gather around more,” Guo Yanglong said lightheartedly as he drank another cup of wine.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We can’t stay for a few days longer. We will be travelling, but the Qing residence will always welcome members of the Guo Clan.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only stayed a day at Guo Clan. His main motive was to improve the relationship between the two clans. After the interactions between both families, Qing Shui had quite a good impression of Guo PoLu, so he tried to create more opportunities for him and Qing Qing to be together.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Regarding Yan City and even Yan Jiang Country, Qing Shui did not have the least amount of interest who would take over. It was easy to guess. Since Xiao Clan had been eradicated and Yan Clan had been defeated, if the authority was no longer under the remaining Yan Clan, it will be under families like Guo Clan, Lai Clan or Luo Clan.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and the others prepared to make their way back to Hundred Miles City. It was the first time in her life that Qing Qing was leaving Yan City and her first time riding on a flying beast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Standing on the back of the Firebird, she viewed the surroundings with amazement. She looked around at the clouds, at the boundless skies that stretched out to the distance, the large rivers and mountains under her feet and there was a yearning in her eyes, but, it was only for a brief moment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, who was standing beside her, was observing his sister’s reaction. He could vaguely guess her thoughts, especially that last bit of yearning in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What are you thinking about?” Qing Shui asked smilingly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Nothing. Hehe. I was thinking that my brother is actually so powerful.” Qing Qing laughed gently as she replied.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Big sister, you should laugh more in the future. This is the first time I’ve seen you laugh. My sister is so good looking, no wonder Guo PoLu is infatuated with you.” Qing Shui laughed with the same warmth as he teased his sister.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He noticed that her gaze had turned slightly cold and complicated. Qing Qing did not laugh but looked at him seriously. He felt slightly anxious. With a sympathetic expression and eyes filled with care and concern, he looked towards Qing Qing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you want me to be with Guo PoLu to build the relationship between Qing Clan and Guo Clan?” Qing Qing asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When she said this, Qing Shui felt relieved. He knew why she just had that sort of reaction. After all, she fell to such a dire situation only because of such practices of marriage for connections. Therefore, she hated that from the bottom of her heart….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, one Guo Clan cannot even compare to a strand of your hair. You and mother are the most important people to me and as long as your brother is here, no one will ever bully you. Nobody will ever force you to do what you don’t want to.” Qing Shui assured Qing Qing sincerely.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing looked at how Qing Shui responded and felt a special warmth in her heart. Ever since their father died, no one had ever said anything like that to her. For a person who lost all sense of security since she was ten, this moment with her blood-related brother, such a strong martial artist, she felt his care, concern and familial love from his words…&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing felt an impulse to cry as these emotions overwhelmed her. She just felt like crying, not because she was sad, but it was the realization that this was the feeling of happiness…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui, the corners of her eyes turning red, as tears welled up in her eyes, but there was a smile on her face. Like raindrops on a pear blossom, tears fell down her beautiful face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why are you so good to me?” Qing Qing hugged Qing Shui as she repeated that a few times.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Because you are my sister. We are related by blood and share the same mother. We are siblings,” Qing Shui said gently as he patted her back.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just like that, Qing Shui and his group reached Hundred Miles City uneventfully within a month.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they reached the Qing residence, all the other members of the Qing Clan were relieved. Qing Bei was so happy that she even cried.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After she saw Qing Qing, she ran over calling her happily, “Sister Qing!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You must be Little Bei!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes! Now I won’t be the only girl in Qing Clan. Yay!” Qing Bei pulled Qing Qing’s hand affectionately as she exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the day that they returned, Qing Luo went back to the Qing Clan village.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the second day, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li left for Canglang country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Because of Qing Qing, Qing Shui decided not to leave at this time. Furthermore, they would be celebrating the new year soon. Qing Shui decided to think about other things after the new year.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Luo returned to the now quiet Qing Clan village, he saw a man with a head of grizzled hair waiting for him at the Qing residence entrance. This man was often seen at the library and Qing Shui called him Grandfather Lin.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lin!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo shouted out when he saw the old man.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You’re back. So things went well.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Great. Great!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two elderly men held their hands together. With their many years of friendship, they were even closer than brothers.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go in to talk!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Both of them entered the now empty Qing residence.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Luo, tell me about Qing Shui’s progress. I really look forward to that,” The old man said to Qing Luo with a complicated expression in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo narrated the details of what Qing Shui did in Yan City. The old man listened carefully to what Qing Luo said. On his calm face, the turbid complication in his eyes slowly turned to a clear brightness.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Younger Brother Luo!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo looked at Lin Zhanhan quizzically.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I want to pass down the things I know to Qing Shui,” Lin Zhanhan responded with a short hesitation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You have really decided?” Qing Luo asked with astonishment. He was mostly pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“After we celebrate the new year, I will teach Qing Shui some remaining things. I am old and useless now. Otherwise, I would have stopped the mere clan from another city from bullying Qing Clan village to his extent. And it must be hard for that girl, Yi…” There was a quiet desolation in the old man’s voice, as if one who had reached the last leg of his life.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Qing, have you thought of starting your cultivation? Do you still want to?” Qing Shui asked Qing Qing the next morning when he spotted her looking intently at the other members of the Qing Clan practicing.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I am so much older than them, but my cultivation level is so low. I have not practiced for so many years.” Qing Qing shook her head and looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“As long as you wish to cultivate, there won’t be any problems. Brother can guarantee that you will reach Xiantian level within five years. We still have so much time to travel around the world of Nine continents.” Qing Shui replied good-naturedly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Can I?” Qingqing asked hopefully with some self doubt.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes. Come. I will give you some things.” Qing Shui laughed heartily.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing smiled and followed Qing Shui to the large hall on the third floor. Qing Shui had Qing Qing wait for him as he entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He took out two of each Energy enhancing Fruit, Stamina Enhancing Fruit, Endurance Enhancing Fruit and Agility Enhancing Fruit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing gained 1,000 jin of strength and 1,000 jin of defence. Her speed doubled and there was some increase in her vital energy. This made Qing Qing’s eyes sparkle with happiness as she looked at Qing Shui. Everyone hoped to be stronger and of course Qing Qing was elated with this sudden huge increase in her abilities.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Older sister, let’s go do our morning practice together. I will teach you some skills.” Qing Shui smiled as he said that to his happy sister. He found that she looked more like a normal young lady now. She was too empty in the past. He will always remember the feeling he had when he first saw her. Then, he told himself that he would definitely make her happy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he had almost succeeded. Seeing her so happy, Qing Shui felt even more joy than when he was happy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Deer Cantering!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui first let Qing Qing get accustomed to her current speed, as her speed had increased in such a short time. After she was familiar with her own speed, he let her train with Deer Cantering first.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Qing was tired of Deer Cantering, Qing shui taught her Taichi Fists. Back Connecting Fist was still not suitable for her. Combining Taichi Fist with Deer Cantering can already be considered a proper set. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui taught Qing Qing Taichi Fists, he also practiced at the same time. Before long, it was time for breakfast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was very lively during breakfast. Qing Qing had already gradually adapted to this as it had already been a month.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister Qing, I will bring you around Hundred Miles City and I will tell you about stories from when Brother Shui was young.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“...” Qing Shui was silent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang had returned to the Shi Clan when they were back. Basically, there were only members of the Qing Clan in the residence now. The Qing Clan had already reached a legendary status in Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Somehow everyone in Hundred Miles City had come to know that Qing Shui went to Yan City and eliminated Yan Clan and Xiao Clan. Though Qing Shui was bewildered by this, he had to recognize how widespread news that come from such grapevine sources can be.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yanjiang Country was much stronger than Canglang Country. Yan City was the capital of Yanjiang and was controlled by Yan Clan and Xiao Clan. The clans were actually eliminated by a young martial artist from Hundred Miles City, the worst city in Canglang Country. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">How would this not be shocking to everyone? Such a small insignificant Hundred Miles City was now well-known in the world. This was because of Qing Shui. Qing Shui’s name was now totally associated with Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The residents of Hundred Miles City were very happy. As the existence of a “Guardian” like Qing Shui lessened the worries of many, worries like occurrence of massacred cities in the Central Continent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In the world of the Nine continents, there were many bloodthirsty bandits everywhere. There was an abundance of them. Their numbers are so large that they can compete with the largest sect in a continent or compete with a city the size of Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr">Previously, there was no way to bring that up. &nbsp;Actually, talking about it now will also bring controversies. Things have already changed for Qing Clan and Qing Qing was no longer that girl who was abandoned by the Yan Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, you must stay longer this time. Yourself, Qing Qing, Qingyou and PoLu are all young people. Everyone should gather around more,” Guo Yanglong said lightheartedly as he drank another cup of wine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We can’t stay for a few days longer. We will be travelling, but the Qing residence will always welcome members of the Guo Clan.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only stayed a day at Guo Clan. His main motive was to improve the relationship between the two clans. After the interactions between both families, Qing Shui had quite a good impression of Guo PoLu, so he tried to create more opportunities for him and Qing Qing to be together.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Regarding Yan City and even Yan Jiang Country, Qing Shui did not have the least amount of interest who would take over. It was easy to guess. Since Xiao Clan had been eradicated and Yan Clan had been defeated, if the authority was no longer under the remaining Yan Clan, it will be under families like Guo Clan, Lai Clan or Luo Clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and the others prepared to make their way back to Hundred Miles City. It was the first time in her life that Qing Qing was leaving Yan City and her first time riding on a flying beast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Standing on the back of the Firebird, she viewed the surroundings with amazement. She looked around at the clouds, at the boundless skies that stretched out to the distance, the large rivers and mountains under her feet and there was a yearning in her eyes, but, it was only for a brief moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, who was standing beside her, was observing his sister’s reaction. He could vaguely guess her thoughts, especially that last bit of yearning in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are you thinking about?” Qing Shui asked smilingly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Nothing. Hehe. I was thinking that my brother is actually so powerful.” Qing Qing laughed gently as she replied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Big sister, you should laugh more in the future. This is the first time I’ve seen you laugh. My sister is so good looking, no wonder Guo PoLu is infatuated with you.” Qing Shui laughed with the same warmth as he teased his sister.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He noticed that her gaze had turned slightly cold and complicated. Qing Qing did not laugh but looked at him seriously. He felt slightly anxious. With a sympathetic expression and eyes filled with care and concern, he looked towards Qing Qing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you want me to be with Guo PoLu to build the relationship between Qing Clan and Guo Clan?” Qing Qing asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When she said this, Qing Shui felt relieved. He knew why she just had that sort of reaction. After all, she fell to such a dire situation only because of such practices of marriage for connections. Therefore, she hated that from the bottom of her heart….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, one Guo Clan cannot even compare to a strand of your hair. You and mother are the most important people to me and as long as your brother is here, no one will ever bully you. Nobody will ever force you to do what you don’t want to.” Qing Shui assured Qing Qing sincerely.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing looked at how Qing Shui responded and felt a special warmth in her heart. Ever since their father died, no one had ever said anything like that to her. For a person who lost all sense of security since she was ten, this moment with her blood-related brother, such a strong martial artist, she felt his care, concern and familial love from his words…&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing felt an impulse to cry as these emotions overwhelmed her. She just felt like crying, not because she was sad, but it was the realization that this was the feeling of happiness…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui, the corners of her eyes turning red, as tears welled up in her eyes, but there was a smile on her face. Like raindrops on a pear blossom, tears fell down her beautiful face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why are you so good to me?” Qing Qing hugged Qing Shui as she repeated that a few times.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Because you are my sister. We are related by blood and share the same mother. We are siblings,” Qing Shui said gently as he patted her back.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just like that, Qing Shui and his group reached Hundred Miles City uneventfully within a month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they reached the Qing residence, all the other members of the Qing Clan were relieved. Qing Bei was so happy that she even cried.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After she saw Qing Qing, she ran over calling her happily, “Sister Qing!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You must be Little Bei!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes! Now I won’t be the only girl in Qing Clan. Yay!” Qing Bei pulled Qing Qing’s hand affectionately as she exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the day that they returned, Qing Luo went back to the Qing Clan village.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the second day, Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-li left for Canglang country.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Because of Qing Qing, Qing Shui decided not to leave at this time. Furthermore, they would be celebrating the new year soon. Qing Shui decided to think about other things after the new year.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Luo returned to the now quiet Qing Clan village, he saw a man with a head of grizzled hair waiting for him at the Qing residence entrance. This man was often seen at the library and Qing Shui called him Grandfather Lin.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Lin!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo shouted out when he saw the old man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You’re back. So things went well.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Great. Great!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two elderly men held their hands together. With their many years of friendship, they were even closer than brothers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go in to talk!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Both of them entered the now empty Qing residence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Luo, tell me about Qing Shui’s progress. I really look forward to that,” The old man said to Qing Luo with a complicated expression in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo narrated the details of what Qing Shui did in Yan City. The old man listened carefully to what Qing Luo said. On his calm face, the turbid complication in his eyes slowly turned to a clear brightness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Younger Brother Luo!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo looked at Lin Zhanhan quizzically.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I want to pass down the things I know to Qing Shui,” Lin Zhanhan responded with a short hesitation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You have really decided?” Qing Luo asked with astonishment. He was mostly pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“After we celebrate the new year, I will teach Qing Shui some remaining things. I am old and useless now. Otherwise, I would have stopped the mere clan from another city from bullying Qing Clan village to his extent. And it must be hard for that girl, Yi…” There was a quiet desolation in the old man’s voice, as if one who had reached the last leg of his life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Qing, have you thought of starting your cultivation? Do you still want to?” Qing Shui asked Qing Qing the next morning when he spotted her looking intently at the other members of the Qing Clan practicing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I am so much older than them, but my cultivation level is so low. I have not practiced for so many years.” Qing Qing shook her head and looked at Qing Shui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“As long as you wish to cultivate, there won’t be any problems. Brother can guarantee that you will reach Xiantian level within five years. We still have so much time to travel around the world of Nine continents.” Qing Shui replied good-naturedly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can I?” Qingqing asked hopefully with some self doubt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes. Come. I will give you some things.” Qing Shui laughed heartily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing smiled and followed Qing Shui to the large hall on the third floor. Qing Shui had Qing Qing wait for him as he entered the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He took out two of each Energy enhancing Fruit, Stamina Enhancing Fruit, Endurance Enhancing Fruit and Agility Enhancing Fruit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing gained 1,000 jin of strength and 1,000 jin of defence. Her speed doubled and there was some increase in her vital energy. This made Qing Qing’s eyes sparkle with happiness as she looked at Qing Shui. Everyone hoped to be stronger and of course Qing Qing was elated with this sudden huge increase in her abilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Older sister, let’s go do our morning practice together. I will teach you some skills.” Qing Shui smiled as he said that to his happy sister. He found that she looked more like a normal young lady now. She was too empty in the past. He will always remember the feeling he had when he first saw her. Then, he told himself that he would definitely make her happy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui felt that he had almost succeeded. Seeing her so happy, Qing Shui felt even more joy than when he was happy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Deer Cantering!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui first let Qing Qing get accustomed to her current speed, as her speed had increased in such a short time. After she was familiar with her own speed, he let her train with Deer Cantering first.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Qing was tired of Deer Cantering, Qing shui taught her Taichi Fists. Back Connecting Fist was still not suitable for her. Combining Taichi Fist with Deer Cantering can already be considered a proper set. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As Qing Shui taught Qing Qing Taichi Fists, he also practiced at the same time. Before long, it was time for breakfast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was very lively during breakfast. Qing Qing had already gradually adapted to this as it had already been a month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister Qing, I will bring you around Hundred Miles City and I will tell you about stories from when Brother Shui was young.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“...” Qing Shui was silent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Shi Qingzhuang had returned to the Shi Clan when they were back. Basically, there were only members of the Qing Clan in the residence now. The Qing Clan had already reached a legendary status in Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Somehow everyone in Hundred Miles City had come to know that Qing Shui went to Yan City and eliminated Yan Clan and Xiao Clan. Though Qing Shui was bewildered by this, he had to recognize how widespread news that come from such grapevine sources can be.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yanjiang Country was much stronger than Canglang Country. Yan City was the capital of Yanjiang and was controlled by Yan Clan and Xiao Clan. The clans were actually eliminated by a young martial artist from Hundred Miles City, the worst city in Canglang Country. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">How would this not be shocking to everyone? Such a small insignificant Hundred Miles City was now well-known in the world. This was because of Qing Shui. Qing Shui’s name was now totally associated with Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The residents of Hundred Miles City were very happy. As the existence of a “Guardian” like Qing Shui lessened the worries of many, worries like occurrence of massacred cities in the Central Continent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the world of the Nine continents, there were many bloodthirsty bandits everywhere. There was an abundance of them. Their numbers are so large that they can compete with the largest sect in a continent or compete with a city the size of Hundred Miles City.&nbsp;</p>
