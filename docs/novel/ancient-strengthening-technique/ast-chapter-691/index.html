 <p><strong>AST 691 - Yearning</strong></p>
 <p>After spending some time with Hai Dongqing, Qing Shui realized that she was actually quite agreeable. Meeting her here made him feel as if he had reunited with an old friend he hadn't seen in a very long time.</p>
 <p>"Auntie!"</p>
 <p>At that moment, a sharp voice suddenly rang out. Qing Shui could tell that it was Hai Shiya, that lady who had once been very close with Tan Yang.</p>
 <p>Hai Shiya walked in and saw Qing Shui who was with Hai Dongqing. She was first alarmed before she broke into a smile and said, "Oh, Auntie is together with someone?"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this lady who was tall, had a beautiful face, and was quite curvy. Her face was filled with a feminine charm and she gave off a blissful feeling.</p>
 <p>With one look, Qing Shui could sense that she should be someone who had just gotten married. She was at the stage where the love between the couple was the strongest and there was also physical satisfaction.</p>
 <p>"Hello. I've heard from Auntie that you're someone she thinks very well of." Hai Shiya smiled and greeted Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"You horrible lass, what are you talking about." Hai Dongqing scolded Hai Shiya in an irritated tone.</p>
 <p>"Hello!" Qing Shui smiled and replied. Previously, both Hai Dongqing and himself had stood up. Now, all three of them sat down around the table.</p>
 <p>They had a few polite exchanges. After all, Qing Shui wasn’t familiar with either Hai Dongqing or Hai Shiya. However, as they chatted, they seemed to gradually know each other better.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui was around, Hai Shiya left after a short while. However, before she did, she blinked her beautiful eyes at Qing Shui, and said, "Recently, my Aunt hasn't been very happy. However, she seems to be very happy today. Thank you."</p>
 <p>She left behind these words that puzzled Qing Shui and made him not know how to respond.</p>
 <p>"Don't listen to her gibberish. You must be tired as well, I'll bring you to your room." Hai Dongqing said casually.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui agreed and followed her. The snow outside had already stopped, even though it was still a cloudy day. This was how the weather here was usually like. Normally, there would be a full sunny day once in a week.</p>
 <p>Plowing through the thick layers of snow, they headed for the pavilion building.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Greencloud Continent!</p>
 <p>Qing Clan!</p>
 <p>"Sister, you're already Misty Hall's Palace Mistress and Sister Jiange is also Heavenly Palace's Guardian." Huoyun Liu-Li chuckled and said to Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>"I'm merely standing in for now. When Sister Chen comes back, I'll pass back the position to her. Elder Ge promised me that." Canghai Mingyue's beautiful eyes were full of smiles as she looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>"Each time he leaves, it's for a long period of time..." Huoyun Liu-Li sighed unconsciously.</p>
 <p>"Why, Liu-Li, do you missing him?" Canghai Mingyue smiled and looked at Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>Being stared at by Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li's blushed. "Doesn't elder sister miss him? Zun`er and Yin`er are both starting to recognize people. When that rascal comes back, the two of them won't be able to recognize him."</p>
 <p>Saying this, Huoyun Liu-Li smiled.</p>
 <p>At the mention of her two kids, a blissful smiled appeared on Canghai Mingyue's face. "Liu-Li, we must learn to be more considerate of him. He has gone through more sufferings than anyone else for so many years. Even if he doesn't mention it, even if other people are not aware, aren't we aware of it?"</p>
 <p>Hearing Canghai Mingyue's words, a slight sparkle appeared in Huoyun Liu-Li's eyes. "Mmm, I know. Sister, that's why I'm very happy. The fact that we can all be together is better than anything else. We've seen a lot of what he had put in and experienced, but it's also possibly that there's much more that we've not seen. Everything will turn out fine for us in the future."</p>
 <p>"Mommy!"</p>
 <p>"Mommy!"</p>
 <p>"Aunty!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Zun and Qing Yin ran over towards Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li. The two kids were around two years old and could already run around. It's about the time when they would start to remember what was happening around them.</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue felt very satisfied looking at her son and daughter. She reached out to carry Qing Zun while Huoyun Liu-Li carried Qin Yin.</p>
 <p>The two of them were extremely good-looking, as if they were carefully carved from jade. Qin Yin looked very similar to Canghai Mingyue. Although she was still very young, her brows and eyes were just like Canghai Mingyue. As for Qing Zun, his brows were like Canghai Mingyue's but his eyes and nose were closer to Qing Shui's. For the other areas, they didn't particularly look like their parents.</p>
 <p>"You rascal, look at how dirty you've gotten yourself." Canghai Mingyue smiled as she pinched Qing Zun's cheek.</p>
 <p>Qin Yin was not much better. Canghai Mingyue smiled as she rubbed Qin Yin's head and spoke to her. The two kids replied with their loud laughter and reached out for Canghai Mingyue's face.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li appeared to be very happy as well. It was just that she had an indescribable feeling!</p>
 <p>It was actually not very lively in Qing Clan anymore. Yiye Jiange and Luan Luan were in the Heavenly Palace. Huoyun Liu-Li would be there most of the time too, but she would come back to stay in the Qing Clan once every few days.</p>
 <p>Wenren Wu-shuang was also in the Heavenly Palace now and was an Elder of Misty Hall. Shi Qingzhuang was together with Wenren Wu-shuang while Canghai Mingyue stayed in Qing Clan to take care of her two kids. Mingyue Gelou and Yuchang also stayed at Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>With the support of a Martial Saint cultivator, the Qing Clan was like the rising sun in Greencloud Continent. On the surface, there were no other clans who could stand up to them.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Palace's Patriarch was from Qing Clan, and there were also multiple Martial Saint level cultivators in Qing Clan. Moreover, there were also budding hopes in Qing Clan, as the abilities of the younger generation's were soaring at a rapid speed.</p>
 <p>This was especially so for Luan Luan, Qing Bei and Qing You. As the Qing Clan's younger generation, they were already starting to show their shine. If other people knew of Luan Luan's actual cultivation level, they might not just feel that she was just beginning to shine.</p>
 <p>"Granny!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>After they saw Qing Yi, the two kids ran over happily. After taking the Xiantian Golden Pellet, Qing Yi didn't appear to age. She was already a grandmother now. Although Luan Luan and Yuchang also called her granny, they weren't the same as Qing Zun and Qin Yin.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that Yuchang wasn’t Qing Shui's kid. Even though Qing Shui treated her as his own family, and Qing Yi did the same. Despite this, she still hoped that Qing Shui could have a child of his own.</p>
 <p>Everyone in Qing Clan felt that Luan Luan was Qing Shui's own kid, but she was unlike Qing Zun and Qin Yin whom everyone had seen growing up bit by bit. The feelings spent on them were different. Luan Luan had only come to Qing Clan after she was a bit older.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi carried the two of them, one in each hand.</p>
 <p>Just then, Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang came and called out everyone to that it was meal time. It was rarer now for everyone in Qing Clan to have their meals together. However, sometimes, Qing Luo, Lin Zhanhan and the other members of Qing Clan would come over for a meal.</p>
 <p>Qing Yi's place was now also considered a small branch of its own, with quite a number of people when everyone was present.</p>
 <p>After the few Martial Saints &nbsp;from the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord submitted to Qing Shui, they had also started to live here. Everyone lived together harmoniously.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Hundred Miles City!</p>
 <p>Everything in Hundred Miles City remained the same. It wouldn't be changing just because a certain person was not around. It continued to grow as usual. Without the Night Fragrance Court, 花月楼 appeared; without Situ Clan, Zheng Clan appeared.</p>
 <p>The Shi Clan was still the biggest clan and the Yu Clan was also a reputable clan. Due to Qing Shui's reputation, Hundred Miles City had now become a special existence in Cang Lang Country.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui wasn’t in Hundred Miles City, everyone knew that a lady from the Shi Clan was his fiancee. This condition alone was sufficient to make the Shi Clan a special existence. Moreover, Shi Clan was Hundred Miles City's strongest pillar.</p>
 <p>Yu Clan!</p>
 <p>"Lass, it's been so long... You still can't get over him?" Yu Donghao walked up to Yu He who was standing next to the pond.</p>
 <p>"I want to forget him, but I can't. Grandfather, what do you think I should do?" Yu He replied dejectedly.</p>
 <p>"Lass, your cultivation level is quite good now. Why don't you go out for a walk? Maybe you'll be able to forget him and find the one that is right for you." Yu Donghao gave it some thought and advised.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, I'm thinking of going to the ‘Hundred Flowers Garden’. Back then, Granny Hundred Flowers said that I'm more suited to cultivate the Hundred Flower Secret Arts and said that if I've thought it through, I can look for her in Hundred Flowers Valley." Yu He looked at this old man who had treated her the best... her closest kin.</p>
 <p>"Are you sure you want to go?"</p>
 <p>"I'm sure!"</p>
 <p>"Lass, actually, you can go look for him. I've lived for so many years and I have seen a lot. Qing Shui definitely feels something for you." Yu Donghao sighed and said.</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, no need to say anymore. A love that comes from pity and charity... I'd rather not have it." Yu He frowned, feeling pained.</p>
 <p>"Lass, you're overthinking things. Why can't you get over this point? You're stubborn, but so is Qing Shui. If neither of you take the first step forward, you won't be able to get together. Lass, have you thought about this before?" Yu Donghao felt pained when he saw Yu He like this.</p>
 <p>"I can't do this yet. In the future, maybe I can. Even if I were to appear before him, I can't do so like this." Yu He mumbled.</p>
 <p>"No matter what you want to do, grandfather will support you. You must take care of yourself.” Yu Donghao let out a long sigh."</p>
 <p>"Grandfather, I will. Don't worry." Yu He clenched her teeth and said.</p>
 <p>"When are you setting off?" Yu Donghao knew that he wouldn’t be able to stop this stubborn lass.</p>
 <p>"Tomorrow. Grandfather, you'll have to take care too!"</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui followed Hai Dongqing to the pavilion and saw that it was very clean here. It hadn’t been treated as a storage place and was only treated as a backup home.</p>
 <p>The hall was very big but just empty. Other than a few paintings of mountains and rivers on the walls, there were nothing else.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing led Qing Shui up to the 2nd floor and stopped before a room next to the staircase. She then reached out with her hand and gently pushed open the door.</p>
 <p>This was a small bedroom with a double bed which was two meters in both length and width. There were bedsheets, but no blankets.</p>
 <p>There was a window at the back with a purple colored standing shelf made from altar wood. Hai Dongqing smiled as she walked up to it, taking out a thin pink-colored blanket and placinh it on the bed.</p>
 <p>"You'll have to put up with it and stay here for now." Hai Dongqing said, feeling bad.</p>
 <p>"Thank you. It's very good here." replied Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Then have a good rest. I'll be heading back as well." After saying this, Hai Dongqing felt a bit weird but she smiled and turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui sent her out. The sky had just started to turn dark. Darkness falls earlier and the sun rises later here than in other places. Nightfall and daylight was split 50-50. However, there were still light stones, so there wasn’t much difference between night and day. After all, the Cold Ice City was a city that never slept.</p>
 <p>Returning to the room, Qing Shui laid down on the bed. It wasn’t the time to enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal yet. After everything turned quiet, Qing Clan realized that it had been about a year since he had left Greencloud Continent. He couldn’t help but think of his mother, Canghai Mingyue, and the other ladies, as well as the kids, especially those two children of his.</p>
