 <p><strong>AST 1086 - Lion King's Li Fire Formation, Killing with Great Power</strong></p>
 <p>Wuwu!</p>
 <p>Beitang Lie’s eyes popped out and he took great effort to swallowed down the Coldsteel Bead which was the size of an egg. His eyes were bloodshot and filled with tears.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui killed three people in the time he took to swing his hand. One of them wasn’t even able to say a single word. If not for the fact that Beitang Lie was considered quite powerful, he wouldn’t be able to withstand this Coldsteel Bead. Of course, Qing Shui had intentionally left him alive. It was because Qing Shui judged from his clothes and skills that this man should be an important character in Lion King’s Ridge.</p>
 <p>However, just swallowing a Coldsteel Bead was sufficient to make him feel awful for a while. Moreover, the guy basically ended up losing every single one of his teeth. When Qing Shui saw that Yiye Jiange was hurt, he had wanted to kill this guy immediately. However, Qing Shui now felt that it would be going too easy on him to let him die.</p>
 <p>This sudden change caused everyone to stop. However, a few demonic beasts once again pounced towards Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>With a soft bellow, the Nine Continents Mountain in the air pushed forth and collided against the huge demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>This was what it meant to be easily destroyed!</p>
 <p>Tremendous and terrifying roars rang out as the demonic beasts collided with the Nine Continents Mountain, many of them turning into a pile of ground meat.</p>
 <p>In the time it took for Qing Shui to snap his fingers, over ten demonic beasts were blasted off. Qing Shui landed next to Yiye Jiange. He looked at her arm which had been dyed red by blood and asked, “Who did that?”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui!” Yiye Jiange looked at Qing Shui and smiled, her eyes filled with tears. It was impossible to know if these tears were of sadness or of joy. It could be half of each!</p>
 <p>“Alright, I won’t ask who did it. I won’t let a single one of them leave this place alive.” Qing Shui said in a soft to the people on the other side but there was powerful killing intent in his voice.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange smiled and looked at Qing Shui. She had never felt so calm in his arms before. Earlier, when she saw him killing in fury, she felt very warm inside. When she felt the most desperate, this person had appeared…</p>
 <p>“Little Fattie, are you alright?” Qing Shui looked at Little Fattie who also seemed a little dejected.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qing Shui, I’m fine. Sorry.” Little Fattie was also despondent to see Yiye Jiange get hurt. He had given his word to Qing Shui but now…</p>
 <p>“Little Fattie, I don’t blame you. I hadn’t expected to encounter them either.” Qing Shui smiled and interrupted Little Fattie who was blaming himself.</p>
 <p>“Sister Yu, Sister Qing, Sister Yan…” Qing Shui greeted them.</p>
 <p>Yiye Jiange pushed both her hands against Qing Shui’s chest and said, “I’m fine now. You can put me down.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had actually been healing her injuries all along. He gradually put her down and took her hands. It was only after seeing that her arm injury wasn’t very serious that he felt relieved.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, that Beitang Lie is Lion King's Ridge's young lord."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at that middle-aged man dressed in golden-colored clothes. That man still seemed to be in agony. Right now, that man was being surrounded by many others and his expression was painful and twisted. Many of the others were looking at Qing Shui in astonishment. To them, Qing Shui was a demon.</p>
 <p>In the Five Continents, they held tremendous power. With their abilities, other than Northern Sacred Lu Continent, they were invincible in any other places within the Five Continents. This time around, they had come to the Ancient Ruins, hoping to try out their luck. As long as they encountered good things, it wouldn't matter even if it belonged to someone else. As long as they were still within the Ancient Ruins, they would be able to snatch the items openly. This has always been a world where it was survival of the fittest.</p>
 <p>However, to think that this young man who had suddenly appeared could do this to them and to even be able to kill them instantly in this Ancient Ruins... How could they not be afraid?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gradually walked over to the opposite side. Beitang Lie finally felt a little bit better, but he was now looking at Qing Shui, feeling horrified. He knew that there was no way that things could end in their favor.</p>
 <p>"Set up the formation!"</p>
 <p>Lion King's Li Fire Formation!</p>
 <p>Everyone quickly took action, each of them holding a formation flag which was three feet long. These flags had the drawing of a fire lion on it. They surrounded Beitang Lie and three old men who were wearing fiery red clothes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui walked until he was about 50 meters away from them before he came to a stop. There were demonic beasts on each of the opponents' side while the Nine Continents Mountain was on top of Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>"Who are you? Why are you getting involved with matters concerning our Lion King's Ridge?"</p>
 <p>When Beitang Lie spoke, he was in agony. He no longer had any teeth and air was flowing out as he spoke. However, even at this point, he still hoped to settle the matter peacefully.</p>
 <p>"Who am I? Why am I getting involved with matters involving Lion King's Ridge? You've injured my woman. Don't you think that's enough reason for me to tear you into pieces?" Qing Shui said, wearing a false smile.</p>
 <p>"Yiye Jiange is your woman?" Beitang Lie held back the pain he felt while speaking and when he looked at Qing Shui, it was unclear whether his expression was that of astonishment or fury...</p>
 <p>"Is there a need to doubt this? Since you've injured my woman, I shall give you two options." Qing Shui spoke once again. After all, it was not a bad idea to spite him before he was to die.</p>
 <p>"What are the options?"</p>
 <p>Frightened by that small mountain above Qing Shui, Beitang Lie knew that things wouldn't end so simply. However, he had to force himself to ask. As long as he could survive this episode, there would be plenty of ways for him to take revenge after they've left the Ancient Ruins.</p>
 <p>"You can take your own life or I can do it for you." Qing Shui looked straight at Beitang Lie who was in a pitiful state.</p>
 <p>"I've also gotten injured today and you've killed a number of our people from Lion King's Ridge. If enmity is not settled amicably there is no end to it. Why don't we both take a step back and I'll make it up for you through other means?" Despite never having been on the losing end before, Beitang Lie had no choice but to keep his temper in check.</p>
 <p>"You guys had shamelessly bullied a few ladies with your numbers and yet you still dare to say something like this. If you're a man, you should just step forward and don't continue hiding behind them." Qing Shui let out a light bellow and waved his hand, sending his Nine Continents Mountain to attack.</p>
 <p>The huge Nine Continents Mountain tore through the air. The twisted air could be seen by the naked eye. The currents on both sides of the Nine Continents Mountain gushed forth as it smashed toward those large demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Sand flew about and the air was filled with the smell of smoke. There were also the terrified cries from their demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Since he had taken action, Qing Shui didn't plan on stopping. The Nine Continents Mountain smashed out with a violent strength and would kill two huge demonic beasts each time.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, tens of demonic beasts disappeared under Qing Shui's Nine Continents Mountain. The prowess of the Nine Continents Mountain made Qing Shui feel exhilarated. There was an indescribable sense of enjoyment to be able to go through such violent massacre.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a roar rang out. It was only that Qing Shui looked towards his opponents' formation. The formation had been activated and the faint red colored glow from the formation fluctuated with a powerful aura. The glow from this formation was in the shape of a huge fire lion which was about 100 meters in size. With a low howl, all the air before it went through major explosions.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, this formation isn't bad."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this huge lion before him. There weren't any world's regulations in the Ancient Ruins like there were in the Five Continents. To think that it had the strength of 1.5 million stars.</p>
 <p>This formation was very practical. To think that it could connect so many people. As expected of the strongest formation of the Lion King's Ridge. This was the Li Fire formation in the Lion King's Formation. It was said that the Lion King's Ridge still had other formations. This particular formation was good when multiple people worked together and as long as they could cooperate well, there were no limits to the number of people who could be included. However, the more people, the more energy required, and the stronger the prowess.</p>
 <p>The formation's prowess was related to the strength of those people. Although Qing Shui had killed a few of them earlier, there were still over 40 of them. Each of the remaining ones had a strength of 100,000 stars, with a few who were even at 300,000 stars. Right now, this formation could unleash a prowess of 1.5 million stars and was definitely terrifying.</p>
 <p>It could only be said that the people from the Lion King's Ridge were very unlucky or that Qing Shui was very lucky. If it wasn't because he had gotten his hands on a Sacred Spirit Grade treasure, he would be helpless in this situation.</p>
 <p>The Lion King's Li Fire Formation was the final trump card for the people from the Lion King's Ridge. This was why earlier if they could come to an agreement, they wouldn't want to take the risk. The Nine Continents Mountain from earlier had already terrified them and if this final trump of theirs didn't work, what awaited them would only be death.</p>
 <p>And right now, they had no other choice but to fight to a bitter death.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The huge red lion opened its mouth and the surroundings were engulfed by a sea of flames.</p>
 <p>Li Fire!</p>
 <p>The most powerful fire in the five elements. This fire was similar to the flames that the Fire Bird used to spew out.</p>
 <p>Flame Lightning!</p>
 <p>A stream of pure red-colored flames appeared, seemingly covered with something that resembled sizzling electricity.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Armor Manifestation!</p>
 <p>With a wave of his hand, a Primordial Flame Ball flew out toward that electrifying fire!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The Primordial Flame Ball was destroyed and the electrifying fire once again attacked towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Nine Continents Mountain!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain could be used for both attack and defense. This was why Qing Shui let it block the middle. When the electrifying fire landed on the Nine Continents Mountain, a sizzling sound rang out. However, there was no damage done to the Nine Continents Mountain at all.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wore a faint smile. This Nine Continents Mountain was really powerful. To think that it could even fend off such a powerful attack. Moreover, the Nine Continents Mountain was too heavy. After receiving such a powerful attack, not only did it not receive any damages, it didn't even move an inch.</p>
 <p>Go!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slapped his hand on the Nine Continents Mountain and it flew toward the huge ‘fire lion’.</p>
 <p>Its speed was extraordinarily fast and in an instant, the two collided!</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The huge lion was sent flying. When the Nine Continents Mountain attacked, it would have the pushing back impact that the Shield Attack had. Moreover, the Nine Continents Mountain's attack was slightly more powerful than the huge lion's prowess. Two times that of Qing Shui's speed was already quite terrifying.</p>
 <p>Next, the Nine Continents Mountain continued to smashed against the huge lion again and again. Putting aside the fact that this ‘lion’ was not as strong as Qing Shui, even if it was slightly more powerful than Qing Shui, it wouldn't be able to take such an attack. Each attack reduced the endurance prowess of both sides and in terms of endurance, those who would dare to compete with Qing Shui would die a terrible death.</p>
 <p>Boom boom...</p>
 <p>Consecutive explosive sounds rang out. It was like the Lion King's Li Fire Formation set up by the Lion King's Li Fire Formation was blocked by a sandbag. All the powerful flame attacks it had released were blocked by the Nine Continents Mountain and each smash from the Nine Continents Mountain would reduce quite a lot of their endurance. Although the prowess of such a formation was very great, so was the depletion. Its fatal flaw was that it could not last long.</p>
 <p>In less than 15 minutes, the fiery red glow started to flicker. After all, during this period of time, the Nine Continents Mountain had collided against the Lion King's Li Fire Formation countless times from different directions. It was already quite good that they could hang on for so long.</p>
 <p>Pa!</p>
 <p>Finally, the Lion King's Li Fire Formation couldn't hold on anymore and just scattered. The Nine Continents Mountain smashed toward them and even if the people from the Lion King's Ridge were quick to dodge, half of them were sent flying from the collision, turning into blood-colored lumps before disappearing into the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the people from Lion King's Ridge. They were very pale and had blood trickling down from the corner of their lips. They weren't wearing any expressions at all!</p>
 <p>The Nine Continents Mountain smashed down once again. This time around, its target was the horrified Beitang Lie.</p>
