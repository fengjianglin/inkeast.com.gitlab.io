 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2315 - Three Treasure Pagodas, Divine Rain Sect Comes Knocking</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was a little agitated now. He had already reached the ninth level of the Cave Realm and had achieved the Gold Refinement for seven of his caves. He hadn't made any breakthroughs since then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he yearned to reach the tenth level of the Cave Realm, it was a legendary realm after all; it wasn't something that could be forced. He also hadn't heard that the peak was absolutely at the tenth level of the Cave Realm. Qing Shui only wished to wait for all of his nine caves to turn into gold before obtaining the last crucial breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Divine Buddha Portrait was useful, or rather, very useful to Qing Shui. However, it didn't mean that this Divine Buddha Portrait would be able to let Qing Shui attain a breakthrough to achieve ten caves. However, it could help to raise Qing Shui's realm. As for the actual effects, it would be a test of Qing Shui's comprehension.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Yang gave every treasure for Qing Shui to look at, letting him take whatever he wished. However, there weren't many things that could pique his interest. Although this was the Lower Three Regions, Qing Shui would hardly care about their treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qing Shui looked over the things, he helped Hao Tian and the others choose some stuff. Some of the items were veritable treasures, and ordinary people wouldn't know how to use them. They would mostly be collected as strange items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, there were actually three Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagodas. All of them hadn't been unsealed before; they seemed old and rustic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were good items and the three of them looked exactly the same. They were all Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagodas. The two ladies and himself, each already had a set. Qing Shui gave it some thought, and after some consideration, he let Chi Yang, the Mighty Strength Battle God, and Hao Tian to bind each of the Pagodas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the two ladies didn't have the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, he would naturally give the chance to the two ladies. If there were good things, they would naturally have the priority. Other people wouldn't be able to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mighty Strength Battle God and the Beast King Battle God joined his Divine Palace at the same time. The same went for Hao Tian and Zi Ye. Therefore, when Qing Shui got his hands on good stuff, he would try his best to distribute it fairly. As for the Chi Clan, he naturally had to give them a share, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was still wondering about how he should make the Chi Clan stronger. Thankfully, the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagodas came up at the right time. It would actually be even better if they came up earlier, as the earlier battle would have been won even more easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mighty Strength Battle God was like a tiger that had gained wings; his might increased a lot after he got the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda. This ability to fend off attacks was too terrifying. Even attacks that ignored one's defenses could be blocked off. This wasn't a form of defense, but negation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui always had a Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagoda, but he knew that it was a waste for him since his attacking prowess was too weak. At the very least, at his current level, he didn’t feel content with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they felt the powerful ability of the pagoda, the three of them almost couldn't believe it. Those small pagodas were definitely Divine Artifacts. Chi Yang could block off an attack of over 1.6 trillion Dao Force. What kind of concept was this? Even if he were to fight against that old monk again, even without Qing Shui's support, the old monk would not be able to do anything to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as they couldn't do anything to Chi Yang, then there wouldn't be any problems for the Chi Clan to establish their standing in the Eight Desolates City. No one would go and create trouble for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Mighty Strength Battle God and Hao Tian were very agitated as well. The Mighty Strength Battle God had always admired Qing Shui. Qing Shui had cured him of his condition, allowing his awakened powers to increase from 20% to the current 80%. The medicinal pills and other things thereafter, allowed his strength to increase by many a fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, with this little pagoda, he could become an unrivaled existence amongst people of strength similar to his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't that Hao Tian couldn't accept Qing Shui; otherwise, he wouldn't have joined the Divine Palace. During this period of time, he knew that the difference between himself and Qing Shui was inestimable. Jealousy was something that would only exist between two people who didn't have too vast of a gap, but one party had a lot more luck. An ordinary family would be envious of a millionaire, but they wouldn't harbor much thoughts toward a billionaire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their gap was too big and therefore they didn't have the luxury of feeling jealousy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said that Qing Shui had given him a great gift that day, making him develop a feeling of worship toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others also had a share of good stuff, but there weren't any more of such small pagodas. The effect of the small pagodas wasn't made known to irrelevant people. Nothing good would arise from having this fact revealed to others. Only the three, who had gotten the pagodas to recognize them as their owners, knew about their effects. None of them would tell to other people. After all, there would be no benefits if this were made known, except to bring about jealousy in others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the battle earlier on, the two ladies' battle prowess had already been very terrifying. They seemed to have handled the battle with ease. It was because their attacking prowess wasn't bad and thus the Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagodas had blocked almost all of their opponents' attacks. Therefore, the enemies hadn't been able to deal much damage to the two ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Parry Heavenly Fate Treasure Pagodas allowed the battle prowess of this group to increase by a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they had only returned to the Chi Clan's manor for a few days, things were slowly recovering. Many people from the Chi Clan's side branches had gathered around the manor and things started to slowly get back on track.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This situation continued on for slightly more than a week before two people arrived at the Chi Clan manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were two middle-aged men who appeared poised and dignified, both wearing a snow-white Cloudrain attire. They gave off a great feeling of tranquility and wouldn't be taken lightly no matter where they went. They said outright that they were looking for the Chi Clan's head the moment they arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snow-white Cloudrain attire was the typical clothing that the people from the Divine Rain Sect wore. Many bystanders were especially curious to see the people from the Divine Rain Sect visiting the Chi Clan. The Divine Rain Sect was the dominator over the Lower Three Regions; a super existence, an absolutely massive force. Just an Elder from the Divine Rain Sect would be able to wipe out a great clan like the Chi Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dominating force of the Lower Three Regions had a long standing legacy, and it was said that they had already existed since ancient times. They were an unrivaled existence in the Lower Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chi Yang knew that people from the Divine Rain Sect had come, his heart let out a thud. What would come would eventually come. He had no idea if this was considered fast or slow. Just then, Qing Shui coincidentally arrived and Chi Yang told him that people from the Divine Rain Sect had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since they're here, then let's go have a look. Come, I'll go with you." Qing Shui was slightly stunned but still remained calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui felt very stuffy. He had already come to the Eight Desolates Region for a while yet was still unaware of how strong the forces in Eight Desolates City were. Other than in the Eight Desolates City, what other powerful cities were there? Were there any Divine Palaces or Demon Gates? Was Tantai Lingyan in the Lower Three Regions...?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was good as well. Qing Shui had initially wanted to skip the Lower Three Regions and head to the fourth region directly. The Sky-Obstructing Crow had told him that with his abilities, he could head to the fourth or even the fifth region directly. Therefore, Qing Shui had planned on heading to the Middle Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't know how strong the Divine Rain Sect was, but he knew that an existence that dominated over the Lower Three Regions would still be a powerful existence even in the Middle Three Regions. They might not even be weak when compared to those at the top of the Middle Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they entered the hall, they saw two poised and dignified middle-aged men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"May I ask what's the reason the Divine Rain Sect has come to visit the Chi Clan?" Chi Yang asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Rain Sect would usually not appear. When they did, it would definitely not be for anything good. The Divine Rain Sect was like a great sect that was in seclusion, the god in the Lower Three Regions. They usually wouldn't have any liaison with other forces and the reason they appeared would be to punish the force concerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're here to settle a debt on behalf of our Master. We seek the cooperation of the Chi Clan's head." The man on the left said softly, giving off a feeling of confidence and superiority. He gave off the feeling that he was above all others, like what he was doing now. Although he addressed Chi Yang as the Chi Clan's head, he probably viewed this position as worthless and didn't give a damn about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"May I ask what the Chi Clan owes you?" Chi Clan frowned but still asked calmly.</span></p>
