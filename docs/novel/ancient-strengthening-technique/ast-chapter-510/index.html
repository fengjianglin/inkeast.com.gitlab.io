  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 510 Fickleness of Human Relationships, Who Is the Wastrel?</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">"The heaven is jealous of geniuses. Such circumstances are not rare. It's just that such an outstanding person like him is too much of a surprise. He's really monstrous. No matter where in the World of the Nine Continents he goes, he would still be at a monstrous level."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's right. There would probably only be one such character every few hundred years in the World of the Nine Continents!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hai Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Aunt, is what you said the true?" In a room in the Hai Clan, Hai Shiya looked toward Hai Dongqing and asked.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It doesn't matter if it's true or not. Maybe everyone only saw the exterior appearances." Hai Dongqing smiled and said, her lightly curled lips were beautiful and intoxicating. Her beauty was such an intellectual and elegant one that it would sap one's soul. Her pretty eyes had a keen sense of observation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Aunt, you're really beautiful. I wonder which lucky guy will be able to have the good fortune of bringing you home." Hai Shiya looked at Hai Dongqing in a daze and smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Lass, are you looking for a beating?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upon saying this, Hai Dongqing raised her hand very quickly, her pretty hand had the feeling of a ‘flying phoenix,’ slapping down on Hai Shiya's well-rounded and perky butt.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Slap!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The crisp and loud sound caused Hai Shiya to blush from her face to her neck!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Aunt, you're so bad!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hoho!" A crisp and magnetic laughter rang out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Elder brother, everything is good now. Now, you won't have to feel down anymore. Look at how happy both father and grandfather are." Jin Guyao looked towards Jin Changzheng and said.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Sigh, I wonder if I should be feeling happy or not."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"If they’re not a friend, the worse the plight they land in, the better!" Jin Guyao smiled brightly like a bloomed flower and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Yaoyao!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just then, a loud voice came from outside. It sounded young and full of vigor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother, Martial Brother Luo is here to look for me. I'll be heading out!" Jin Guyao laughed and went out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A strong young man stood outside the door, a faint smile hanging on his face. When he saw Jin Guyao coming out, his smile grew even stronger!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother Luo!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao ran over happily and grabbed onto the young man's hand, calling his name affectionately.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Let's go. I'll bring you to meet that person today!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui?" Jin Guyao looked at the young man weirdly and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Hehe, he's now a cripple. aren't you happy?" The young man held onto Jin Guyao with one hand and said as they walked out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Happy, of course, I am happy." Jin Guyao eyes narrowed into a crescent and looked at the young man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You demoness, what, are you craving for it again?" The strong young man's hand slipped down Jin Guyao's waist and landed on her perky butt. He grabbed it, fingers sinking down into her soft flesh.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was tender and bouncy, and even through the clothes, he could feel its smoothness. The other hand also reached out to grasp that pair of mountain peaks.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother, there are other people around!" Jin Guyao spoke in a coquettish voice to the young man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"There's a forest over there!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pulling Jin Guyao, he dashed into the forest!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother, why are you being in such a hurry..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"You demoness, your Martial Brother will be sapped dry by you sooner or later!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall's Palace Mistress and Di Qing did not follow Qing Shui to head to Cang Wuya's place. She knew that Qing Shui had something to speak to Cang Wuya. Therefore, they only watched as Qing Shui disappeared around the corner.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Upon turning around, Qing Shui saw the few people standing at the door. It was Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They were all looking at him. At this moment, Qing Shui felt both forlorn and gratified!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui, she could no longer control her tears as she ran up to him. She knew everything about Qing Shui, and now, looking at Qing Shui's figure, she felt extremely pained and sad.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She hugged Qing Shui and uncontrollably sobbed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Alright, Liu-Li, stop crying. Aren't I alright now? Don't cry!" Qing Shui lightly patted Huoyun Liu-Li's tender back. Suddenly he felt as if a very far gap had appeared between himself and many other people. However, he was pulled in closer by this lady who was hugging him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Having lost my abilities, I've lost even this little confidence!" Qing Shui could not help but say bitterly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, it's alright even if you've lost your cultivation. We'll go back, we'll go back to Hundred Miles City. Don't feel sad. We won't get involved in anything here anymore. We won't get involved anymore..."</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lightly hugged her, hugged this kind-hearted girl. Other than his mother, she was the one closest to himr. With such a lady by his side, what more could he ask for?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Suddenly Qing Shui recalled of the term 'friend’!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was his friend, his close friend, and an intimate one at that!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Wasn't what she said earlier the same as what he was thinking? Suddenly, Qing Shui felt that some warmth was quickly spreading out in his body.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li only got up after a long while, her eyes red. Hugging Qing Shui's arm, when she saw Qing Shui's light smile, she smiled as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It felt very calming, and there was also another feeling which Qing Shui liked a lot but found it hard to describe.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Old Master!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li walked up to the others and he called out to Cang Wuya.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"It's good that you're fine, it's good that you're fine!" Cang Wuya smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Martial Uncle Fei!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, Gelou!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried Little Yuchang and smiled at the two ladies. His smile could not hide the pain and disappointment he was feeling.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Daddy!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Come, let's all go in!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone headed indoors. However, they had not spoken much when the sound of footsteps came!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"We heard that Elder Qing Shui is back and have specially come to visit!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sound was oddly shrilling, especially to the people in the house. The few ladies all frowned and Huoyun Liu-Li was even about to stand up with her sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Liu-Li, be good!" Qing Shui pulled back Huoyun Liu-Li and headed outside after smiling bitterly at Cang Wuya and the others.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">People from the Feng Clan, Starday Hall's Feng Clan, the Wolf Clan, the Song Clan, the Starday Hall's Chief Disciple who had been humilated before by him before, the Gongsun Clan,the Jin Clan, Yan Ling`er, Xi Ri...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that there were many people, some who he had bad blood with, some who he had none with, and also those who came to watch the show!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling`er ran up to Qing Shui, her exquisite little face filled with worry!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Why did you come?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at Yan Ling`er. After almost losing his life, and having yet to step out from his trauma, Qing Shui was able to treat many things with great calm.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I heard many people talking about you. I was worried." Yan Ling`er said softly. Her usual persistence made Qing Shui felt touched. Maybe this was also kinship.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, how are you now?" Xi Ri walked up to Qing Shui, his face without any expression, but a hint of worry was reflected in his eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Brother Xi, for your concern. I'm fine!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, do you, still recognize me?"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Jin Guyao walked up with a strong young man. She spoke out as she looked at Qing Shui with a sweet smile. She appeared to be very intimate with that young man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Who wouldn't know Second Miss Jin?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I wonder how Brother Qing Shui's cultivation level is now?" Jin Guyao asked teasingly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Many people had wanted to ask this question and wanted to see how Qing Shui would reply. However, they reckoned that there was still someone behind Cang Wuya and Qing Shui, and thus did not dare to step out.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Cultivation level? There should be no problem for me to defeat you." Qing Shui chuckled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Haha, so what if you can defeat a lady? You're a genius. I wonder if this genius dares to have a battle with me?" The young man next to Jin Guyao said teasingly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Are you sure you want to have a battle with me?" Qing Shui did not panic at all, and neither was there any changes to his expression. He just looked, with a pair of clear eyes, at this young man who seemed to be considered quite good amongst the Heavenly Palace's younger generation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He did not have to guess to know why these people had come. Since there was no way he could get out of it, Qing Shui decided to go the extreme. There was no way that he would shrink out of this.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was now without any cultivation and one would be able to sense that all his meridian channels had broke by just using the Spiritual Sense. How serious were his injuries? &nbsp;Even if he was still alive, he was now a cripple.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If he did not dare to challenge a cripple, how could he, a Martial King level expert, be able to face up to the others?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'm sure!" The young man gritted his teeth. Back then, Qing Shui's reputation had spread very far throughout the Heavenly Palace. Even though everyone knew that he had lost all his cultivation, the name 'Qing Shui' was still one which they were a bit fearful of.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Where should we do it? Should we head to the arena?" The young man asked Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"That's going to waste too much time. Since there're so many people here, we can make it a fair battle to the death." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, don't battle with him. You're already in such a condition... I don't care, you're not allowed to accept it." Huoyun Liu-Li held onto Qing Shui tightly, not agreeing to this arrangement.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li's action caused everyone to believe even stronger that Qing Shui was left with no cultivation at all. Although they could sense that his meridian channels had broke, they were still worried that he had other trumps up his sleeves.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Be good, it'll be fine!" Qing Shui patted Liu-Li's hand and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I hope you're not doing this on purpose, letting a woman stop you. If you don't dare to take up the challenge, just say it straight. No one will blame you. You're just a wastrel, everyone would be able to understand." Jin Guyao, hugging onto the young man's arm, looked and said viciously toward Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, Huoyun Liu-Li let go of Qing Shui and said, "I'll take you on on his behalf!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Liu-Li!" Qing Shui spoke softly, but everyone could tell the firmness his calm tone hid.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui!" Huoyun Liu-Li immediately teared up. Many people would be able to guess how the outcome would be, but when facing it, it was still extremely hard.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Trust me. I will not joke with my life on the line. I haven't married you yet!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, look after Liu-Li, don't let her be reckless!" Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue and said.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue had grown up in a family which cultivated martial arts. Moreover, she had also traveled a lot in Greencloud Continent. She knew well of a man's pride. It was just like how it was now. Even if he was in the wrong, he would still need to persist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had yet to say anything before a soft figure went into his arms. This was the first time Canghai Mingyue did this. Qing Shui hugged her, not thinking of any evil thoughts at all, only having feelings of grief.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother Luo, bring him down!" Jin Guyao looked toward the young man and said. She was furious just looking at the few ladies around Qing Shui. She still bore a grudge toward how Qing Shui had treated her previously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"I'm going to make my move! Get ready!"</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded, not replying.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The young man stomped down fiercely, shooting towards Qing Shui at great speed. He headed towards Qing Shui who was neither holding anything nor wearing any armor.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could see that this sword attack was very slow. Although he was crippled, his mental state was still there. It was just that although his opponent appeared to be very slow, his own body was moving even slower.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sword pierced into him!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only activated the Minute Subtlety. To others, he seemed to have stood there without moving at all, allowing the longsword to pierce into his chest.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The young man smiled slyly. However, before he stopped smiling...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui right hand suddenly reached out. Even without his cultivation, with his Divine Arm Clearing, as well as the Solitary Rapid Fist he had practiced no less than a million times in his earlier days, Qing Shui's arms had already reached an unbelievable level of flexibility. Even without his cultivation and powers, this was sufficient!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The sharp gold needles pierced into his opponent's temple...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The young many found it unbelievable, and could only feel something had pierced into his head before everything turned black and he gradually fell down next to Qing Shui.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's expression did not change at all. He held onto a gold needle which was covered in blood. When the longsword pierced into him, he had not even cried out in pain, nor did his expression change in any bit.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">"A wastrel would always be a wastrel!" Qing Shui looked toward Jin Guyao who was standing there in a daze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was making his stand firm, letting people know that they should be wary when challenging him! Even if he was crippled, he was not a pushover. Moreover, with the "Stone of Life", he would be fine as long as his head was not chopped off, he was not slashed into two at the waist, or if his body was not torn into pieces.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 510 Fickleness of Human Relationships, Who Is the Wastrel?</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">"The heaven is jealous of geniuses. Such circumstances are not rare. It's just that such an outstanding person like him is too much of a surprise. He's really monstrous. No matter where in the World of the Nine Continents he goes, he would still be at a monstrous level."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's right. There would probably only be one such character every few hundred years in the World of the Nine Continents!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hai Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Aunt, is what you said the true?" In a room in the Hai Clan, Hai Shiya looked toward Hai Dongqing and asked.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It doesn't matter if it's true or not. Maybe everyone only saw the exterior appearances." Hai Dongqing smiled and said, her lightly curled lips were beautiful and intoxicating. Her beauty was such an intellectual and elegant one that it would sap one's soul. Her pretty eyes had a keen sense of observation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Aunt, you're really beautiful. I wonder which lucky guy will be able to have the good fortune of bringing you home." Hai Shiya looked at Hai Dongqing in a daze and smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Lass, are you looking for a beating?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Upon saying this, Hai Dongqing raised her hand very quickly, her pretty hand had the feeling of a ‘flying phoenix,’ slapping down on Hai Shiya's well-rounded and perky butt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Slap!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The crisp and loud sound caused Hai Shiya to blush from her face to her neck!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Aunt, you're so bad!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hoho!" A crisp and magnetic laughter rang out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jin Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Elder brother, everything is good now. Now, you won't have to feel down anymore. Look at how happy both father and grandfather are." Jin Guyao looked towards Jin Changzheng and said.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Sigh, I wonder if I should be feeling happy or not."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"If they’re not a friend, the worse the plight they land in, the better!" Jin Guyao smiled brightly like a bloomed flower and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Yaoyao!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just then, a loud voice came from outside. It sounded young and full of vigor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother, Martial Brother Luo is here to look for me. I'll be heading out!" Jin Guyao laughed and went out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A strong young man stood outside the door, a faint smile hanging on his face. When he saw Jin Guyao coming out, his smile grew even stronger!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother Luo!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jin Guyao ran over happily and grabbed onto the young man's hand, calling his name affectionately.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Let's go. I'll bring you to meet that person today!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui?" Jin Guyao looked at the young man weirdly and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Hehe, he's now a cripple. aren't you happy?" The young man held onto Jin Guyao with one hand and said as they walked out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Happy, of course, I am happy." Jin Guyao eyes narrowed into a crescent and looked at the young man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You demoness, what, are you craving for it again?" The strong young man's hand slipped down Jin Guyao's waist and landed on her perky butt. He grabbed it, fingers sinking down into her soft flesh.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was tender and bouncy, and even through the clothes, he could feel its smoothness. The other hand also reached out to grasp that pair of mountain peaks.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother, there are other people around!" Jin Guyao spoke in a coquettish voice to the young man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"There's a forest over there!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pulling Jin Guyao, he dashed into the forest!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother, why are you being in such a hurry..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"You demoness, your Martial Brother will be sapped dry by you sooner or later!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Misty Hall's Palace Mistress and Di Qing did not follow Qing Shui to head to Cang Wuya's place. She knew that Qing Shui had something to speak to Cang Wuya. Therefore, they only watched as Qing Shui disappeared around the corner.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Upon turning around, Qing Shui saw the few people standing at the door. It was Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji, Canghai Mingyue, Huoyun Liu-Li, Mingyue Gelou and Little Yuchang!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They were all looking at him. At this moment, Qing Shui felt both forlorn and gratified!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Huoyun Liu-Li saw Qing Shui, she could no longer control her tears as she ran up to him. She knew everything about Qing Shui, and now, looking at Qing Shui's figure, she felt extremely pained and sad.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She hugged Qing Shui and uncontrollably sobbed!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Alright, Liu-Li, stop crying. Aren't I alright now? Don't cry!" Qing Shui lightly patted Huoyun Liu-Li's tender back. Suddenly he felt as if a very far gap had appeared between himself and many other people. However, he was pulled in closer by this lady who was hugging him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Having lost my abilities, I've lost even this little confidence!" Qing Shui could not help but say bitterly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, it's alright even if you've lost your cultivation. We'll go back, we'll go back to Hundred Miles City. Don't feel sad. We won't get involved in anything here anymore. We won't get involved anymore..."</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui lightly hugged her, hugged this kind-hearted girl. Other than his mother, she was the one closest to himr. With such a lady by his side, what more could he ask for?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Suddenly Qing Shui recalled of the term 'friend’!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was his friend, his close friend, and an intimate one at that!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Wasn't what she said earlier the same as what he was thinking? Suddenly, Qing Shui felt that some warmth was quickly spreading out in his body.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li only got up after a long while, her eyes red. Hugging Qing Shui's arm, when she saw Qing Shui's light smile, she smiled as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It felt very calming, and there was also another feeling which Qing Shui liked a lot but found it hard to describe.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Old Master!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li walked up to the others and he called out to Cang Wuya.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"It's good that you're fine, it's good that you're fine!" Cang Wuya smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Martial Uncle Fei!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, Gelou!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui carried Little Yuchang and smiled at the two ladies. His smile could not hide the pain and disappointment he was feeling.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Daddy!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Come, let's all go in!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone headed indoors. However, they had not spoken much when the sound of footsteps came!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"We heard that Elder Qing Shui is back and have specially come to visit!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sound was oddly shrilling, especially to the people in the house. The few ladies all frowned and Huoyun Liu-Li was even about to stand up with her sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Liu-Li, be good!" Qing Shui pulled back Huoyun Liu-Li and headed outside after smiling bitterly at Cang Wuya and the others.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">People from the Feng Clan, Starday Hall's Feng Clan, the Wolf Clan, the Song Clan, the Starday Hall's Chief Disciple who had been humilated before by him before, the Gongsun Clan,the Jin Clan, Yan Ling`er, Xi Ri...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui noticed that there were many people, some who he had bad blood with, some who he had none with, and also those who came to watch the show!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Brother Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yan Ling`er ran up to Qing Shui, her exquisite little face filled with worry!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Why did you come?" Qing Shui smiled and looked at Yan Ling`er. After almost losing his life, and having yet to step out from his trauma, Qing Shui was able to treat many things with great calm.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I heard many people talking about you. I was worried." Yan Ling`er said softly. Her usual persistence made Qing Shui felt touched. Maybe this was also kinship.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, how are you now?" Xi Ri walked up to Qing Shui, his face without any expression, but a hint of worry was reflected in his eyes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Brother Xi, for your concern. I'm fine!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, do you, still recognize me?"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At that moment, Jin Guyao walked up with a strong young man. She spoke out as she looked at Qing Shui with a sweet smile. She appeared to be very intimate with that young man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Who wouldn't know Second Miss Jin?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I wonder how Brother Qing Shui's cultivation level is now?" Jin Guyao asked teasingly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Many people had wanted to ask this question and wanted to see how Qing Shui would reply. However, they reckoned that there was still someone behind Cang Wuya and Qing Shui, and thus did not dare to step out.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Cultivation level? There should be no problem for me to defeat you." Qing Shui chuckled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Haha, so what if you can defeat a lady? You're a genius. I wonder if this genius dares to have a battle with me?" The young man next to Jin Guyao said teasingly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Are you sure you want to have a battle with me?" Qing Shui did not panic at all, and neither was there any changes to his expression. He just looked, with a pair of clear eyes, at this young man who seemed to be considered quite good amongst the Heavenly Palace's younger generation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He did not have to guess to know why these people had come. Since there was no way he could get out of it, Qing Shui decided to go the extreme. There was no way that he would shrink out of this.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was now without any cultivation and one would be able to sense that all his meridian channels had broke by just using the Spiritual Sense. How serious were his injuries? &nbsp;Even if he was still alive, he was now a cripple.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If he did not dare to challenge a cripple, how could he, a Martial King level expert, be able to face up to the others?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'm sure!" The young man gritted his teeth. Back then, Qing Shui's reputation had spread very far throughout the Heavenly Palace. Even though everyone knew that he had lost all his cultivation, the name 'Qing Shui' was still one which they were a bit fearful of.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Where should we do it? Should we head to the arena?" The young man asked Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"That's going to waste too much time. Since there're so many people here, we can make it a fair battle to the death." Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui, don't battle with him. You're already in such a condition... I don't care, you're not allowed to accept it." Huoyun Liu-Li held onto Qing Shui tightly, not agreeing to this arrangement.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li's action caused everyone to believe even stronger that Qing Shui was left with no cultivation at all. Although they could sense that his meridian channels had broke, they were still worried that he had other trumps up his sleeves.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Be good, it'll be fine!" Qing Shui patted Liu-Li's hand and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I hope you're not doing this on purpose, letting a woman stop you. If you don't dare to take up the challenge, just say it straight. No one will blame you. You're just a wastrel, everyone would be able to understand." Jin Guyao, hugging onto the young man's arm, looked and said viciously toward Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, Huoyun Liu-Li let go of Qing Shui and said, "I'll take you on on his behalf!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Liu-Li!" Qing Shui spoke softly, but everyone could tell the firmness his calm tone hid.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui!" Huoyun Liu-Li immediately teared up. Many people would be able to guess how the outcome would be, but when facing it, it was still extremely hard.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Trust me. I will not joke with my life on the line. I haven't married you yet!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Mingyue, look after Liu-Li, don't let her be reckless!" Qing Shui looked at Canghai Mingyue and said.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Canghai Mingyue had grown up in a family which cultivated martial arts. Moreover, she had also traveled a lot in Greencloud Continent. She knew well of a man's pride. It was just like how it was now. Even if he was in the wrong, he would still need to persist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Qing Shui!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had yet to say anything before a soft figure went into his arms. This was the first time Canghai Mingyue did this. Qing Shui hugged her, not thinking of any evil thoughts at all, only having feelings of grief.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"Martial Brother Luo, bring him down!" Jin Guyao looked toward the young man and said. She was furious just looking at the few ladies around Qing Shui. She still bore a grudge toward how Qing Shui had treated her previously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"I'm going to make my move! Get ready!"</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui nodded, not replying.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Boom!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The young man stomped down fiercely, shooting towards Qing Shui at great speed. He headed towards Qing Shui who was neither holding anything nor wearing any armor.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could see that this sword attack was very slow. Although he was crippled, his mental state was still there. It was just that although his opponent appeared to be very slow, his own body was moving even slower.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sword pierced into him!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui only activated the Minute Subtlety. To others, he seemed to have stood there without moving at all, allowing the longsword to pierce into his chest.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The young man smiled slyly. However, before he stopped smiling...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui right hand suddenly reached out. Even without his cultivation, with his Divine Arm Clearing, as well as the Solitary Rapid Fist he had practiced no less than a million times in his earlier days, Qing Shui's arms had already reached an unbelievable level of flexibility. Even without his cultivation and powers, this was sufficient!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The sharp gold needles pierced into his opponent's temple...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The young many found it unbelievable, and could only feel something had pierced into his head before everything turned black and he gradually fell down next to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui's expression did not change at all. He held onto a gold needle which was covered in blood. When the longsword pierced into him, he had not even cried out in pain, nor did his expression change in any bit.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">"A wastrel would always be a wastrel!" Qing Shui looked toward Jin Guyao who was standing there in a daze.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was making his stand firm, letting people know that they should be wary when challenging him! Even if he was crippled, he was not a pushover. Moreover, with the "Stone of Life", he would be fine as long as his head was not chopped off, he was not slashed into two at the waist, or if his body was not torn into pieces.</p>
