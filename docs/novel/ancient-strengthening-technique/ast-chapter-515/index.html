 <p><strong>Chapter 515 Qing Shui, You Have To Be My Man… Walking Along the Blades and Swords To Trigger The Innate Skills!.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p></p>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 515 - Qing Shui, You Have To Be My Man… Walking Along the Blades and Swords To Trigger The Innate Skills!</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">The water streamed down from the top of the mountain and drizzled on Qing Shui. The spring air still had a touch of chill as the weather was still making its final transition from winter. Qing Shui was crouching down under the waterfall, taking on the immense pressure.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Clenching his teeth while holding on to the fusion of the Qi, Spirit, and Essence wouldn’t actually get Qing Shui to the point of forgetting himself, nor would it make Qing Shui forget about the pain. Instead, it could trigger Qing Shui’s potential and enable him to hold himself up against a pressure that he wouldn’t be able to take under normal circumstances.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If one was to see carefully, they would notice a faint gas drifting in circles around him. It revolved around him like many bits of stars, exuding an abundant amount of powerful Vital Energy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Six hours, half a day, one whole day, and more, Qing Shui’s body was continuously trembling. However, despite his trembling body , he was persistent and insisted on doing it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Within half a year’s time, not only had Qing Shui made the fusion of his Spirit, Qi, and Essence more powerful. He had also cultivated the Vital Energy that emerged from every part of his body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this was the “Qi of Life” shown in the ancient book of “Rebirth”. He knew that it had advanced into a brand new stage. At that time when the Old Ancestor of Heavenly Palace made his move, Qing Shui saw him controlling his strength to the “Realm of Iota“. It was more powerful than his own “Minute Subtlety”. Only until now did Qing Shui find out that it was the result of fusing Spirit, Essence, and Qi.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even the Martial Saint expert in the “Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord”. In between the moment he waved his hands, he too fused his Essence, Qi and Spirit perfectly to a terrifying level and from there, he drew out powerful strength. It’s just like cones and cylinders, it could focus all the strength to a very high degree.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The reason why Qing Shui could stand up against the force of the waterfall was exactly because of the use of his Essence, Spirit, and Qi. And now, what Qing Shui felt happy about was that he had already cultivated the “Qi of Life” in the ancient book of “Rebirth”. What gave Qing Shui hope was that this “Qi of Life” could slowly recover the originally incurable wounds of his body. However, there was still no way of recovering the injuries of his organs. This might be because his “Qi of Life” was still weak.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Three years, it would be equivalent to Qing Shui staying a hundred years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. For now, as long as he could cultivate the ancient book of “Rebirth” and use the Qi of Life to continuously nourish his body, recovering wouldn’t be impossible. Not to mention &nbsp;Qing Shui felt that the “Qi of Life” could still become even stronger. As long as his body recovered, his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique would recover. After that, recovering his strength by relying on himself wouldn’t be entirely impossible as well.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Also considering Lin Zhanhan had mentioned before that he could still recover completely by relying on just the ancient book of “Rebirth”. However, it wasn’t such an easy task to hold on to it. Qing Shui was aware of what kind of bitterness he had been through in the past six months. And this was just the easiest part of the ancient book of “Rebirth”.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“A while longer… Just a little while longer…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crouched down below the enormous waterfall like he was doing a martial art squat, bearing the risk of him breaking his bones just by one slight mistake.Telling himself in his mind to hold on for a little while longer.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">His body has already reached its limit. Qing Shui clenched his teeth and held onto it bitterly. Even though he was in the water and also under a very cold waterfall, Qing Shui was still drenched in sweat. He was sweating head through his soles, it’s just that it’s not visible since he was in the water.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stood on the surface of the rock bare-footed, with his toes grasping to the ground. A trace of dark red bloodstain spread out from the bottom of his feet. But very quickly, it was washed away by the water current.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was about to stop, the “Qi of Life” abruptly rose up. He was getting ready to leave the waterfall, but at that instant, he felt that his body has gotten a lot lighter. Even though his body didn’t move, he felt like he just took a step. It was as if he entered an unusual state.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">That was a very strange feeling. The Qi of Life in his body has suddenly increased by one-fold. Originally when he was under the waterfall, he had already reached his limit, to the point when he couldn’t hold on even if he had wanted to. But now, he suddenly felt incomparably relaxed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The ancient book of “Rebirth” has finally advanced into its next stage. Qing Shui has no idea what Realm he was in at the moment. All he knew was that it had gotten stronger by one-fold compared to before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The “Qi of Life” was also considered to be a kind of qi. It could trigger the most hidden skills in one’s body. It drifted around in one’s body and would stay there for eternity. Unless its essence dispersed and it lost its shape, it would never disappear.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked out of the waterfall casually. Despite how tough the cultivation method was, Qing Shui didn’t end up having curling and strong muscles. However, his muscles had started to look like they were made of steel.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The current Qing Shui looked as sharp as a dashing leopard. However, that indifferent expression added on with the “Life of Qi” that was spreading out from him, they happened to cancel out the sharpness shown from him.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The breakthrough this time has saved up six months of tough training!” Qing Shui laid down on a large and smooth stone in joy, pondering over the breakthrough he had just had.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During these past few months, Qing Shui would lay down on the stone board for a while every day. During these times, Qing Shui would think about a lot of things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was getting ready to rest for today and start the next step of cultivation to challenge himself to his limit tomorrow to tap into the most hidden innate skills in his body.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girls looked on as Qing Shui laid on the stone board. They were all speechless about it. Previously, they saw Qing Shui almost pulling one huge stone up the mountain. Judging by how steep the slope was, they all thought that he would never be able to pull it up the mountain with his condition.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">But when they saw the scene, they couldn’t help but feel tears streaming down across their faces. His speed was even slower than that of snails. He was no longer the person who once possessed ten countries worth of strength. He was just a normal person. By the time he pulled the enormous stone up the mountain, it had already been one week. He looked as if he was washed with blood. Again and again, frazzling the skin off the bottom of his legs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had also fell down countless times and as a result, the skin of his body was also rubbed against the ground.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girls had already known that Qing Shui was trying to trigger the innate skills of his body. However, that scene still made them feel so depressed that they couldn’t bear to look at it. Even though this man had given them quite a lot of shock, but this time, he had really made them feel sorry for him down to their very bones.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Behind a magnificent person was countless sadness, blood, and sweat!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The girls were the ones who could feel the meaning of the words the most. Di Chen could even guess how it felt. Both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li have experienced it more than once, so much so that occasionally, he would have to put everything at stake in order to protect them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they were in South City, when they were in Heavenly Palace.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for Qing Qing, in her eyes, Qing Shui was her hero, forever her hero. He was a tall and omnipotent human. However, during these past six months, she was finally aware that behind her brother’s bright and neat back lied too many stories and encounters.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui who was a year younger than her. Originally, she thought that she was the only one who was unfortunate, the one who suffered the most. But now, she knew that she was wrong.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">She didn’t regret suffering in Yan Jiang Country. This was because her brother who stayed behind in Qing Clan suffered even more than herself. No matter what, he was still the one who had suffered the most.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui who had loosened up his mind immediately fell into a slumber. By the time he woke up, he realized that half a day has already passed. He turned around and looked towards the girls around him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already used to it. It had been three months since he started camping at the waterfall. Basically, the girls would come here to accompany him for a while every day.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go back, Grandpa wants you to go home to eat today.” said Qing Qing as she looked at Qing Shui’s slightly thin face.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For the past few months, the dining table had been really lively. Normally, there would only be Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan. All of a sudden, five more people had popped up. When a person got old, they would enjoy this kind of lively atmosphere the most.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo who had had a lot of experience in life knew that other than Qing Qing, the other three girls had definitely shared an extraordinary relationship with Qing Shui. Furthermore, Lin Zhanhan whose strength recovered had also told Qing Luo about the ability of the girls. Di Chen’s ability in particular, which even Lin Zhanhan was uncertain of, caused Qing Luo to freeze in shock for quite a long time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan felt rueful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">During these past six months, Shi Qingzhuang came by once. She stayed for half a month. Unfortunately, she hadn’t had the chances to be alone with Qing Shui. At the time she was about to leave, she got carried by Qing Shui to a remote place. They once again made love between the earth and sky. The fire that Qing Shui has been accumulating for a long time was all released in one go.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui and Shi Qingzhuang came out, they realized that Huoyun Liu-Li was at a nearby spot outside.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Even though it was between “Heaven and Earth”, Qing Shui would still think about the time when he embraced Shi Qingzhuang’s waist while thrusting into her beautiful and round butt. The resounding and clear noises from their activities could make someone’s blood vessels burst…</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t dare to lock gaze with Huoyun Liu-Li’s resentful eyes. As for Shi Qingzhuang, she embarrassingly greeted Huoyun Liu-Li and left.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are you disgusted with me?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui. Qing Shui didn’t notice the amusing look in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Why would I be disgusted with you? Who would dislike a demoness like you…” Said Qing Shui while forcing a smile.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li also knew what Qing Shui was thinking. She squinted her sexy pupils as she looked at Qing Shui: “I don’t care. This year, Qing Shui, you have to be mine…”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned completely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li on the other hand, blushed. Her charming face got so red that after glancing at Qing Shui once, she immediately ran away.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was something that had happened two months ago. Everytime Qing Shui thought about it, he would be at a loss. Was what he held on to right or wrong?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At night, Qing Shui would still enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. At present, Qing Shui had found something for himself to do in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Forging ironware!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could take up the Heaven Shaking Hammer, he could also swing it around. Hence, Qing Shui would basically spend most of his time to practice forging ironware.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The things he’d forged were the two pieces of ores that he had gotten from the treasures in Flowerfruit Mountain. Even though Qing Shui didn’t have enough strength, the level of this task was still something that he could manage.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As long as one had the form, he or she would be able to capture the essence of forging ironware. Unfortunately, he was lacking in strength.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every time he forged the ironware, he would end up really exhausted, so much so that he would faint towards the end. Every day, he would take out a bit of spare time to practice his Taichi Fist and Back Connecting Fist.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">As for the others, without the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, there would be no point cultivating them. Hence, Qing Shui too stopped wasting time on them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">On the second day, Qing Shui woke up early in the morning. Once again, he ran towards the waterfall which he had been staying at alone for a few months.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had no idea about his current condition. He didn’t know how much longer he could live. But he felt that his body was definitely better compared to how it was half a year ago.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he arrived at the waterfall, Qing Shui pondered for a while before letting out a sigh. He took out a sword that he prepared from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He swung his hand and let it go.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Each of the swords and knives was facing upwards. Cold lights flickered at the point of the blades and swords. Under the sunlight, the vast and expansive cold light made people scalp pins and needles. Qing Shui recalled the critical phase of this stage in the ancient book of “Rebirth”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He revolved the “Qi of Life” and walked past the blade and sword.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">If it was before, Qing Shui wouldn’t have been bothered by this blade and sword. However, for now, it was definitely a sharp tool. One slight mistake and he would be crippled completely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a deep breath. After that, he slowly walked towards the blades and swords bare-footed. He thought about the times he experienced life and death situations, the sufferings he felt in his heart and the things that he hadn’t done.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A lot of scenes flashed across Qing Shui’s mind. An extremely beautiful Yiye Jiange in white clothes, and Luan Luan who should have grown even taller by now. They still wanted him to bring them to the Lion King's Ridge to uphold justice for Yiye Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan’s lifespan hasn’t been solved completely. Not to mention that he had made a promise to Yiye Jiange before. Besides, Luan Luan called him father too.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A sharp pain was felt on the soles of his feet. The “Qi of Life” was revolving turbulently. Qing Shui saw a trace of dark red bloodstain flowing out of his feet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He stepped forward with his other foot. Before the extreme pain from before disappeared, another heart-piercing pain arose once again.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After all, it was the first time he did it. The blades and swords were only the heights of the fingers. After taking three steps,&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, his face turned extremely pale. The excruciating pain made Qing Shui feel dizzy.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He gritted his teeth and bore the pain. Even his lips were torn by himself. After that, he moved forward by one step once more.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The moment Qing Shui stepped out of the Land of “Blades and Sword” that was only a few meters long, he immediately collapsed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the girls rushed here, they blankly stared at the things in front of their eyes. Even Di Chen felt that her eyes were sore. They fed Qing Shui some water while Di Chen gave him a Blood Replenishing Pellet. Qing Shui has lost too much blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">By the time Qing Shui woke up, it had been more than half a day. After he woke up, he immediately felt that the “Qi of Life” in his body has become much finer.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For an instant, he felt that the sacrifices he made were all worth it. It might be because this was how Qing Shui spent his day during this past six months, the girls didn’t say anything. It was just that their caring eyes were still filled with worries.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui grudgingly forced a smile at the girls.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let’s stop cultivating alright? Why don’t we just live our life like how ordinary people does?” Qing Qing, with her eyes red, pulled Qing Shui’s hands.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui maintained his forceful smile. Even if he were to not cultivate for now, the gods wouldn’t let him live his life peacefully. If it weren’t because he wanted to fight the gods for a chance to live, Qing Shui too had wished that he would be able to spend the rest of his life peacefully.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sister, I have been able to bear through it for such a long time. I will not die. I am worried about you and mother. I have said before that I won’t let anyone bully you. I won’t be like this forever, I’m scared that one day, you will get bullied by other people,” Qing Shui said unenthusiastically. These words of his were also his heartfelt words.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;……</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At a blink of an eye, it has been one month.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Every day, Qing Shui would visit the Land of Blades and Swords at least once. Now, this area of blades and swords haD already achieved a height of fifty meters.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The blood that flowed out of Qing Shui condensed into a thick blood layer on the ground. If it was before, Qing Shui would never believe that a person could actually bleed out so much blood.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Only after walking past it did he know about its difficulty. Only if one made sacrifices for something would he or she feel the joy when they succeed. Qing Shui felt that the progress that he made within this month could be compared to the progress he made during the past few months under the waterfall.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At present, Qing Shui looked even more fragile. He was a lot thinner than before. As a man, he gave people a feeling that he was thin to the bone. His bright and clear eyes were really good-looking. The cinnabar in between his eyebrows also looked particularly fresh during this time. Compared to before, it somewhat looked more bewitching.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui looked at his own reflection in the water, he couldn’t help but laugh at himself. But now, the only thing he could do was to let himself recover back to how he was in the past. Hence, Qing Shui didn’t bother much about it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">In a flash, yet another two months had passed. The Blades and Swords that Qing Shui walked along had grown almost one inch tall and a hundred meters long.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui once again walked there, a dazzling halo suddenly showed up on his body. Qing Shui stood there in a daze. At this moment, he felt as if he was about to soar up high into the sky.&nbsp;</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>AST 515 - Qing Shui, You Have To Be My Man… Walking Along the Blades and Swords To Trigger The Innate Skills!</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">The water streamed down from the top of the mountain and drizzled on Qing Shui. The spring air still had a touch of chill as the weather was still making its final transition from winter. Qing Shui was crouching down under the waterfall, taking on the immense pressure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Clenching his teeth while holding on to the fusion of the Qi, Spirit, and Essence wouldn’t actually get Qing Shui to the point of forgetting himself, nor would it make Qing Shui forget about the pain. Instead, it could trigger Qing Shui’s potential and enable him to hold himself up against a pressure that he wouldn’t be able to take under normal circumstances.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If one was to see carefully, they would notice a faint gas drifting in circles around him. It revolved around him like many bits of stars, exuding an abundant amount of powerful Vital Energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Six hours, half a day, one whole day, and more, Qing Shui’s body was continuously trembling. However, despite his trembling body , he was persistent and insisted on doing it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Within half a year’s time, not only had Qing Shui made the fusion of his Spirit, Qi, and Essence more powerful. He had also cultivated the Vital Energy that emerged from every part of his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui knew that this was the “Qi of Life” shown in the ancient book of “Rebirth”. He knew that it had advanced into a brand new stage. At that time when the Old Ancestor of Heavenly Palace made his move, Qing Shui saw him controlling his strength to the “Realm of Iota“. It was more powerful than his own “Minute Subtlety”. Only until now did Qing Shui find out that it was the result of fusing Spirit, Essence, and Qi.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even the Martial Saint expert in the “Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord”. In between the moment he waved his hands, he too fused his Essence, Qi and Spirit perfectly to a terrifying level and from there, he drew out powerful strength. It’s just like cones and cylinders, it could focus all the strength to a very high degree.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The reason why Qing Shui could stand up against the force of the waterfall was exactly because of the use of his Essence, Spirit, and Qi. And now, what Qing Shui felt happy about was that he had already cultivated the “Qi of Life” in the ancient book of “Rebirth”. What gave Qing Shui hope was that this “Qi of Life” could slowly recover the originally incurable wounds of his body. However, there was still no way of recovering the injuries of his organs. This might be because his “Qi of Life” was still weak.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Three years, it would be equivalent to Qing Shui staying a hundred years in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. For now, as long as he could cultivate the ancient book of “Rebirth” and use the Qi of Life to continuously nourish his body, recovering wouldn’t be impossible. Not to mention &nbsp;Qing Shui felt that the “Qi of Life” could still become even stronger. As long as his body recovered, his Qi of Ancient Strengthening Technique would recover. After that, recovering his strength by relying on himself wouldn’t be entirely impossible as well.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Also considering Lin Zhanhan had mentioned before that he could still recover completely by relying on just the ancient book of “Rebirth”. However, it wasn’t such an easy task to hold on to it. Qing Shui was aware of what kind of bitterness he had been through in the past six months. And this was just the easiest part of the ancient book of “Rebirth”.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“A while longer… Just a little while longer…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui crouched down below the enormous waterfall like he was doing a martial art squat, bearing the risk of him breaking his bones just by one slight mistake.Telling himself in his mind to hold on for a little while longer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">His body has already reached its limit. Qing Shui clenched his teeth and held onto it bitterly. Even though he was in the water and also under a very cold waterfall, Qing Shui was still drenched in sweat. He was sweating head through his soles, it’s just that it’s not visible since he was in the water.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stood on the surface of the rock bare-footed, with his toes grasping to the ground. A trace of dark red bloodstain spread out from the bottom of his feet. But very quickly, it was washed away by the water current.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui was about to stop, the “Qi of Life” abruptly rose up. He was getting ready to leave the waterfall, but at that instant, he felt that his body has gotten a lot lighter. Even though his body didn’t move, he felt like he just took a step. It was as if he entered an unusual state.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">That was a very strange feeling. The Qi of Life in his body has suddenly increased by one-fold. Originally when he was under the waterfall, he had already reached his limit, to the point when he couldn’t hold on even if he had wanted to. But now, he suddenly felt incomparably relaxed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The ancient book of “Rebirth” has finally advanced into its next stage. Qing Shui has no idea what Realm he was in at the moment. All he knew was that it had gotten stronger by one-fold compared to before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The “Qi of Life” was also considered to be a kind of qi. It could trigger the most hidden skills in one’s body. It drifted around in one’s body and would stay there for eternity. Unless its essence dispersed and it lost its shape, it would never disappear.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui walked out of the waterfall casually. Despite how tough the cultivation method was, Qing Shui didn’t end up having curling and strong muscles. However, his muscles had started to look like they were made of steel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The current Qing Shui looked as sharp as a dashing leopard. However, that indifferent expression added on with the “Life of Qi” that was spreading out from him, they happened to cancel out the sharpness shown from him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The breakthrough this time has saved up six months of tough training!” Qing Shui laid down on a large and smooth stone in joy, pondering over the breakthrough he had just had.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During these past few months, Qing Shui would lay down on the stone board for a while every day. During these times, Qing Shui would think about a lot of things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was getting ready to rest for today and start the next step of cultivation to challenge himself to his limit tomorrow to tap into the most hidden innate skills in his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The girls looked on as Qing Shui laid on the stone board. They were all speechless about it. Previously, they saw Qing Shui almost pulling one huge stone up the mountain. Judging by how steep the slope was, they all thought that he would never be able to pull it up the mountain with his condition.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">But when they saw the scene, they couldn’t help but feel tears streaming down across their faces. His speed was even slower than that of snails. He was no longer the person who once possessed ten countries worth of strength. He was just a normal person. By the time he pulled the enormous stone up the mountain, it had already been one week. He looked as if he was washed with blood. Again and again, frazzling the skin off the bottom of his legs.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had also fell down countless times and as a result, the skin of his body was also rubbed against the ground.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The girls had already known that Qing Shui was trying to trigger the innate skills of his body. However, that scene still made them feel so depressed that they couldn’t bear to look at it. Even though this man had given them quite a lot of shock, but this time, he had really made them feel sorry for him down to their very bones.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Behind a magnificent person was countless sadness, blood, and sweat!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The girls were the ones who could feel the meaning of the words the most. Di Chen could even guess how it felt. Both Canghai Mingyue and Huoyun Liu-Li have experienced it more than once, so much so that occasionally, he would have to put everything at stake in order to protect them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they were in South City, when they were in Heavenly Palace.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for Qing Qing, in her eyes, Qing Shui was her hero, forever her hero. He was a tall and omnipotent human. However, during these past six months, she was finally aware that behind her brother’s bright and neat back lied too many stories and encounters.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing looked at Qing Shui who was a year younger than her. Originally, she thought that she was the only one who was unfortunate, the one who suffered the most. But now, she knew that she was wrong.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">She didn’t regret suffering in Yan Jiang Country. This was because her brother who stayed behind in Qing Clan suffered even more than herself. No matter what, he was still the one who had suffered the most.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui who had loosened up his mind immediately fell into a slumber. By the time he woke up, he realized that half a day has already passed. He turned around and looked towards the girls around him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was already used to it. It had been three months since he started camping at the waterfall. Basically, the girls would come here to accompany him for a while every day.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Let’s go back, Grandpa wants you to go home to eat today.” said Qing Qing as she looked at Qing Shui’s slightly thin face.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For the past few months, the dining table had been really lively. Normally, there would only be Qing Luo and Lin Zhanhan. All of a sudden, five more people had popped up. When a person got old, they would enjoy this kind of lively atmosphere the most.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Luo who had had a lot of experience in life knew that other than Qing Qing, the other three girls had definitely shared an extraordinary relationship with Qing Shui. Furthermore, Lin Zhanhan whose strength recovered had also told Qing Luo about the ability of the girls. Di Chen’s ability in particular, which even Lin Zhanhan was uncertain of, caused Qing Luo to freeze in shock for quite a long time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Lin Zhanhan felt rueful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">During these past six months, Shi Qingzhuang came by once. She stayed for half a month. Unfortunately, she hadn’t had the chances to be alone with Qing Shui. At the time she was about to leave, she got carried by Qing Shui to a remote place. They once again made love between the earth and sky. The fire that Qing Shui has been accumulating for a long time was all released in one go.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui and Shi Qingzhuang came out, they realized that Huoyun Liu-Li was at a nearby spot outside.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Even though it was between “Heaven and Earth”, Qing Shui would still think about the time when he embraced Shi Qingzhuang’s waist while thrusting into her beautiful and round butt. The resounding and clear noises from their activities could make someone’s blood vessels burst…</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t dare to lock gaze with Huoyun Liu-Li’s resentful eyes. As for Shi Qingzhuang, she embarrassingly greeted Huoyun Liu-Li and left.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are you disgusted with me?” Huoyun Liu-Li looked at Qing Shui. Qing Shui didn’t notice the amusing look in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Why would I be disgusted with you? Who would dislike a demoness like you…” Said Qing Shui while forcing a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li also knew what Qing Shui was thinking. She squinted her sexy pupils as she looked at Qing Shui: “I don’t care. This year, Qing Shui, you have to be mine…”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was stunned completely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Huoyun Liu-Li on the other hand, blushed. Her charming face got so red that after glancing at Qing Shui once, she immediately ran away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was something that had happened two months ago. Everytime Qing Shui thought about it, he would be at a loss. Was what he held on to right or wrong?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At night, Qing Shui would still enter the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. At present, Qing Shui had found something for himself to do in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Forging ironware!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui could take up the Heaven Shaking Hammer, he could also swing it around. Hence, Qing Shui would basically spend most of his time to practice forging ironware.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The things he’d forged were the two pieces of ores that he had gotten from the treasures in Flowerfruit Mountain. Even though Qing Shui didn’t have enough strength, the level of this task was still something that he could manage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As long as one had the form, he or she would be able to capture the essence of forging ironware. Unfortunately, he was lacking in strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Every time he forged the ironware, he would end up really exhausted, so much so that he would faint towards the end. Every day, he would take out a bit of spare time to practice his Taichi Fist and Back Connecting Fist.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">As for the others, without the Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, there would be no point cultivating them. Hence, Qing Shui too stopped wasting time on them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">On the second day, Qing Shui woke up early in the morning. Once again, he ran towards the waterfall which he had been staying at alone for a few months.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had no idea about his current condition. He didn’t know how much longer he could live. But he felt that his body was definitely better compared to how it was half a year ago.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he arrived at the waterfall, Qing Shui pondered for a while before letting out a sigh. He took out a sword that he prepared from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He swung his hand and let it go.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Each of the swords and knives was facing upwards. Cold lights flickered at the point of the blades and swords. Under the sunlight, the vast and expansive cold light made people scalp pins and needles. Qing Shui recalled the critical phase of this stage in the ancient book of “Rebirth”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He revolved the “Qi of Life” and walked past the blade and sword.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">If it was before, Qing Shui wouldn’t have been bothered by this blade and sword. However, for now, it was definitely a sharp tool. One slight mistake and he would be crippled completely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a deep breath. After that, he slowly walked towards the blades and swords bare-footed. He thought about the times he experienced life and death situations, the sufferings he felt in his heart and the things that he hadn’t done.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A lot of scenes flashed across Qing Shui’s mind. An extremely beautiful Yiye Jiange in white clothes, and Luan Luan who should have grown even taller by now. They still wanted him to bring them to the Lion King's Ridge to uphold justice for Yiye Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Luan Luan’s lifespan hasn’t been solved completely. Not to mention that he had made a promise to Yiye Jiange before. Besides, Luan Luan called him father too.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A sharp pain was felt on the soles of his feet. The “Qi of Life” was revolving turbulently. Qing Shui saw a trace of dark red bloodstain flowing out of his feet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He stepped forward with his other foot. Before the extreme pain from before disappeared, another heart-piercing pain arose once again.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After all, it was the first time he did it. The blades and swords were only the heights of the fingers. After taking three steps,&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Very quickly, his face turned extremely pale. The excruciating pain made Qing Shui feel dizzy.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He gritted his teeth and bore the pain. Even his lips were torn by himself. After that, he moved forward by one step once more.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The moment Qing Shui stepped out of the Land of “Blades and Sword” that was only a few meters long, he immediately collapsed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the girls rushed here, they blankly stared at the things in front of their eyes. Even Di Chen felt that her eyes were sore. They fed Qing Shui some water while Di Chen gave him a Blood Replenishing Pellet. Qing Shui has lost too much blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">By the time Qing Shui woke up, it had been more than half a day. After he woke up, he immediately felt that the “Qi of Life” in his body has become much finer.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For an instant, he felt that the sacrifices he made were all worth it. It might be because this was how Qing Shui spent his day during this past six months, the girls didn’t say anything. It was just that their caring eyes were still filled with worries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui grudgingly forced a smile at the girls.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, let’s stop cultivating alright? Why don’t we just live our life like how ordinary people does?” Qing Qing, with her eyes red, pulled Qing Shui’s hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui maintained his forceful smile. Even if he were to not cultivate for now, the gods wouldn’t let him live his life peacefully. If it weren’t because he wanted to fight the gods for a chance to live, Qing Shui too had wished that he would be able to spend the rest of his life peacefully.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sister, I have been able to bear through it for such a long time. I will not die. I am worried about you and mother. I have said before that I won’t let anyone bully you. I won’t be like this forever, I’m scared that one day, you will get bullied by other people,” Qing Shui said unenthusiastically. These words of his were also his heartfelt words.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;……</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At a blink of an eye, it has been one month.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">In a flash, yet another two months had passed. The Blades and Swords that Qing Shui walked along had grown almost one inch tall and a hundred meters long.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Qing Shui once again walked there, a dazzling halo suddenly showed up on his body. Qing Shui stood there in a daze. At this moment, he felt as if he was about to soar up high into the sky.&nbsp;</p>
