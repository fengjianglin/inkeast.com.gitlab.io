 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elite man left. Qing Shui didn’t ask him about his name. With the Divine Square Cauldron in his hand, Qing Shui proceeded to examine it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s this?” Nuo Lan approached Qing Shui. Everything at the Imperial Cuisine Hall was sold out. There were very few people who came every day to cure their terminal illnesses. On some days, there might not even be a single person turning up. The reason was that not everyone could afford the price for the treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be more precise, it was not that they couldn’t afford it but instead, it was because they were unwilling to do so. Qing Shui wouldn’t just blindly help them for free, unless the person truly had nothing on him. It was as said, one must sacrifice something to get another thing in return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui felt that he did nothing wrong. This was a kind of threshold. If Qing Shui were to attend to every patient for free, he would tire himself to death. He never viewed himself as some kind of savior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. For the time being, I am unable to confirm it just yet. But since I can feel decent Spiritual Qi from it, it should be something quite useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Qing Shui still noticed it. He only had to mix the cauldron into the Divine Weapon and everything would have been fine. However, he didn’t try it right away. Instead, he tossed it into the Treasure Basins in the realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the Treasure Basins had also ascended by a lot of levels. It seemed to have reached its maximum state. For the time being, it was able to increase the quality of the objects twice. Unless it went through some mutated changes, it was not likely that there would be any more improvements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three times, one would turn into three, two would multiply into six. This was natural. There was no doubt in how powerful the Treasure Basin was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s plan was to first increase the quality of the Divine Directional Cauldron by a few times. By then, if he were to use it to upgrade his Flying Weapon, it would receive a larger boost from it than from an ordinary cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no longer necessary for Qing Shui to remain in the hall. There were professional staffs in charge of it at the moment. Even if some people came asking for treatments, the illnesses they got were unlikely to kill them immediately. Hence, Qing Shui could get someone to reserve their names and inform them when he was free to get on with their treatments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for those dishes, Qing Shui handed over his ingredients to the chefs in the Imperial Cuisine Hall. Other than Nuo Lan, there were two other people assisting her in selling them. For the time being, a system ran by him had already been formed. Though it was not that huge, the volume of work was also not that high either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the start, Qing Shui had already thought that he mustn’t stay here for too long. Thus, for the time being, even without a physician, the business of the Imperial Cuisine Hall wouldn’t be halted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big sister, there are some things which I may need to settle in Northern King Domain. Please help me look after this place for a while.” Qing Shui requested of Nuo Lan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Northern King Domain? Qing Shui, the Northern King Domain is on hostile term with the Northern Emperor Domain. Considering that you have the aura of a Battle God, you will very easily be targeted by other people while you are there.” Nuo Lan said after a moment of thought. Her eyes were filled with worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know. I will be careful. Considering how big the Northern King Domain is, I may not necessarily run into them. The chance of it happening is too small. Besides, my ability to escape is not to be made light of.” Qing Shui was telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan still seemed worried. Her eyes then sparkled, “I assume it’s about the Five Tigers Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui never expected for her to know about it. Yu Wenda must have been the one who told her about it. Since she already knew, Qing Shui felt that he might as well just admit it and nodded, “Yes, the main reason I am going there this time is to gather some information which Five Tigers Immortal Sect may know about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have underestimated the Five Tigers Immortal Sect. It, along with the Demon Gate, was an existence that could rival against the Divine Palace, as well as Taiyi Immortal Palace. The fact that these forces could balance out with each other had said everything. There might be Immortal Sects Aristocratic Clans that were under the Immortal Sects, but acting like this now might alert the enemies instead.” Nuo Lan said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui hesitated for a while. Nuo Lan was right. There was a high chance that he might end up inadvertently alerting the enemies. But at the same time, he also couldn’t just sit still and do nothing. It took him so much effort to find some evidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nuo Lan noticed Qing Shui’s hesitant expression and proceeded to say, “Don’t worry. Leave it to me. I will help you gather information regarding the Five Tigers Immortal Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure you can do it?” Qing Shui asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course! I have all the information provided by the Divine Palace. Me helping you may be even better than you trying to look for the information yourself.” Nuo Lan lifted up her chin and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then. Sorry for troubling you, Big sister.” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Call me Sister Nuo Lan.” Nuo Lan clenched her teeth and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? Don’t you like it when I call you big sister?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are doing it on purpose, aren’t you? Call me Sister Nuo Lan in the future. I will continue to call you little brother.” Nuo Lan said in joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui rubbed his forehead and said seriously, “Do you know what little brother mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes I do. It means a very, very young boy.” Nuo Lan said, thinking that she understood it perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, back in where I am from, it is also a word that’s used to cuss other people.” Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah? I don’t mean to offend you.” Nuo Lan felt a bit embarrassed seeing Qing Shui being that serious. She was aware that after so many days of being together, they should already be considered great friends with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course I know that. It’s just that I don’t feel good hearing it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Erm, isn’t it normal if I don’t know how you guys address that thing on the lower part of your body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was often said that curiosity could kill a cat. Women were the most curious animal. Qing Shui had expected her to ask that. To stop her permanently from calling him her little brother, he clenched his teeth and said, “We men often call the thing below as our ‘little brother’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qing Shui finished speaking, both of them went blank. After quite a while, Nuo Lan laughed. Her laughter was charming. But right after that, her expression changed immediately. She shot a glare at Qing Shui before leaving the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her face flushed red as soon as she left. It was very red and she looked tender and beautiful like that. She immediately went up the stairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui thought that Nuo Lan was angry. That made sense. Even though he was only trying to explain things before when he said that, but she was still a woman in her prime youth. Saying that would certainly put her in an awkward situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui sat there, not knowing what to say. After a while, when it was about time for dinner, he went up to call her down. He believed that she would have calmed down by now. Even though he might have been a bit impolite earlier on, it wasn’t too excessive.</span></p>

At one time, there was a foolish person who said some vulgar words to her. Without any hesitations, Nuo Lan immediately made him ran around the city naked for three consecutive days.</span></p>

She had many ways to make you feel embarrassed to the point you would feel like burying your head into the ground.</span></p>

Qing Shui then nodded, “Alright then, we will wait for a little while longer. For now, let’s just focus on making the hall successful first.”</span></p>

It was only when half of the time had passed that he walked to the place where the Treasure Basin was located at.</span></p>

Throughout the time of being inside the basin, the quality, as well as spiritual qi of the cauldron, had reached its maximum level. By now, the Divine Square Cauldron Qing Shui had was enough to compare to three normal ones at once.</span></p>
