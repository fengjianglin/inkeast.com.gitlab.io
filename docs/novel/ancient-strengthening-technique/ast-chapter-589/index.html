 <p><strong><strong>589 - Kill, Ending the grudge of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord</strong></strong></p>
 <p>“Alright, all of you, come at me together, that would save me the trouble of dealing with you all one by one.” Qing Shui took out the Violet Gold Divine Shield, the Big Dipper Sword, and a big stack of talismans. The talismans were all grade four talismans drawn using the level of drawing flesh and blood.</p>
 <p>“Kid, this kind of reverse psychology is lame. However, I shall oblige you and play along with you.”</p>
 <p>“Elder Yong, go test that kid out!” said Ba Donghe, without even turning his head.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>An old man, who held a black chain and wore silk garments, walked slowly towards Qing Shui. His expression was incomparably calm as he gazed at Qing Shui with resolution.</p>
 <p>Grade Three Martial Saint!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could feel the strength of the old man, it seemed that these people were really the leading powers of the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. There were ten of them, a significant number and for every one he killed, it was one more enemy dead. He needed to quickly kill one then summon out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had already circulated the vigor in his whole body to its peak earlier. The Godly Force Talisman and Divine Shield Talisman were also used earlier. His hands tightly grasped a stack of other talismans.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the old man’s body rushed at Qing Shui, the black chains in his hands sent a black flame tornado at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Damn, what an incredible speed, such a sinister old man.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare to be careless, that black chain seemed to have poison on it. If it caused him to be paralyzed, then he was basically finished. His hands flickered.</p>
 <p>There were a few Coldsteel Needles hidden among the Heavenly Talisman!</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Violet Gold Divine Shield also rapidly smashed forward!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>What caused Qing Shui to feel surprised was that with the increase in his skills in hidden weapons, he actually struck the arms of his target. Originally, he aimed for the eyes, but the opponent blocked them with his arms. However, it had bought some time for the Shield Attack.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>He spat a mouthful of fresh blood, Qing Shui’s current strength was now sufficient to severely injure his opponent, even without decreasing his opponent’s strength. Following that, Qing Shui quickly summoned the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>Since they were going to fight, he might as well make the first move. Thus, Qing Shui summoned out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and immediately got it to attack a Grade Three Martial Saint at the back.</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Ferocious Diamond Attack</p>
 <p>In an instant, another Martial Saint fell.</p>
 <p>Body Securing Talisman!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui threw out a big stack of Body Securing Talisman. At the same time, he threw the Demon Binding Ropes at Ba Donghe, who was rushing towards him.</p>
 <p>Two unfortunate Martial saints were bound by the Body Securing Talismans, both of them were Grade Four Martial Saints. Qing Shui took the opportunity to throw out the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb, the black foggy web covered the sky and caused the two Martial Saint to shout out in a panic.</p>
 <p>The few Martial Saint who managed to evade were not able to save them, the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb bounded the two Martial Saints. In an instant, there was some mournful and wretched yelling.</p>
 <p>Chi Chi…...</p>
 <p>Even Grade Four Martial Saints could not resist the corrosion of the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb. They attempted to resist for a moment, but the pain it inflicted caused them to give up their resistance, they would rather die than go through with this suffering that was worst than death.</p>
 <p>Be Donghe was full of regret and grievances at this moment, that strange rope was actually able to bind up, causing him to be unable to move. Out of nine elders, four died in an instant…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui controlled the Demon Binding Ropes to keep Ba Donghe bound, it was was only able to bind the target for a breath of time for every use. However, once the time was up, he was able to immediately control the Demon Binding Ropes to bind the target again.</p>
 <p>The remaining five elders indecisively gathered together in a panicked stare, they actually did not dare to take the initiative to attack. They combined their efforts to defend against Qing Shui and when the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb appeared, they would run.</p>
 <p>This could not drag on for any longer, or else, the Demon Binding Ropes would quickly use up all its energy. Qing Shui knew that if Ba Donghe was able to move again, it would become troublesome.</p>
 <p>The first round of attacks earlier did not succeed. Qing Shui had used the Body Securing Talisman and Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb but it still had not succeeded. Even when bound by the Demon Binding Ropes, Ba Donghe was able to evade him twice.</p>
 <p>Ba Donghe had was very strong, the time that the Demon Binding Ropes could bind him was short, thus before the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb could reach him, he could evade it. As for the remaining five elders, even when two of them were bound by the Body Securing Talisman, the other elders would rescue them.</p>
 <p>The strength of their combined effort was not as simple as just adding their strengths together!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui placed the Blackjade Poisonous Spiderweb back in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal and jumped onto the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant, he had no other choice!</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p>Godly Armor Shield!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was worried about getting attacked!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui used the speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and at the same time, he commanded the Diamond Gigantic Elephant to activate the Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>A huge Diamond Sword Qi shot out at the five elders!</p>
 <p>Maybe because the Diamond Gigantic Elephant left a shadow in their hearts when it killed an elder at the start, when they saw the frightening speed of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant and the huge Diamond Sword Qi, the five elders split up and ran in different directions.</p>
 <p>This was the opportunity Qing Shui was waiting for, the Emperor's Qi activated in an instant, locking down two of them, then the Diamond Gigantic Elephant used an Instantaneous Diamond Evasion.</p>
 <p>Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qing Shui soared up, the Big Dipper Sword attacked one of the elders. This sword streaked across the horizon like a rainbow, it was extremely bright and resplendent.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui attacked with all his strength!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant attacked the other elder at the same time!</p>
 <p>Ferocious Diamond Attack!</p>
 <p>Originally, that elder had nearly the strength of 800 countries, the Emperor's Qi lowered it by the strength of 160 countries. The attack of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant reached a terrifying strength of 700 countries, killing him directly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then nimbly killed off the other Grade Three Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Against five people, if he dove in headfirst, he would definitely be injured, possibly even a life threatening injury. The large success stage of the Mighty Elephant Stomp could not be used midair, only when it reached the Great Perfection Stage then could it be executed in both the air and sea.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had to be cautious, most Martial Saints had some kind of special abilities. If he was not careful, he might end up being defeated. Furthermore, amongst the six of them, five were grade Four Martial Saints, one was a Grade Three Martial Saint. If it were not for that, Qing Shui would have just rushed them together with the Diamond Gigantic Elephant.</p>
 <p>As for Ba Donghe, Qing Shui felt that he was at least a Grade Five Martial Saint, thus Qing Shui kept using the Demon Binding Ropes to bind him. It was a good thing that the Demon Binding Ropes was able to barely bind him. If Ba Donghe was just a little stronger, then it was likely that the Demon Binding Ropes would not be able to hold him down.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the energy in the Demon Binding Ropes was used finished and it returned to Qing Shui’s hands. The furious Ba Donghe took out a blood-red sawtooth broadsword.</p>
 <p>Bloodshed!</p>
 <p>It was also known as the Bleeding Battle Blade, it was a Divine Artifact. From the aura it gave off, anyone would know that this weapon was not ordinary.</p>
 <p>As he rushed at Qing Shui, Ba Donghe sliced his left hand’s forefinger on the blade. A drop of blood dripped on the blade, the blood-red battle blade immediately turned into a brighter blood-red.</p>
 <p>That strong atmosphere caused Qing Shui’s expression to change!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare to be negligent and directly jumped onto the back of the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. In an instant, Ba Donghe’s abilities were decreased by 30 %. The remaining three Grade Four Martial Saint formed a horn-shaped formation and surrounded him.</p>
 <p>Slash!</p>
 <p>Ba Donghe’s slash split the sky into two, the huge blood-red sword shadow drew out a huge scarlet blade tip, it seemed as though the sky was bleeding.</p>
 <p>The blood-red sword shadow seemed like a small sun!</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>State of Immovable as Mountains!</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s fighting spirit was elevated and the Violet Gold Divine Shield in his hands struck out with all of his strength!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Ba Donghe both were forced to retreat three steps, Qing Shui had a fierce fighting spirit in his eyes, but Ba Donghe’s eyes contained an indescribable shock. Although his abilities were reduced by 30 %, he did not expect his opponent to be able to break even with him.</p>
 <p>One of the Grade Four Martial Saint on the left side fearlessly rushed at Qing Shui!</p>
 <p>Emperor's Qi!</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demons!</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Instantaneous Diamond Evasion!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui directly struck out with a Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p>That person was tragically killed by Qing Shui, the weakened man only had the strength of 500 countries left. When this man clashed against Qing Shui’s strength that was greater than 700 countries, he instantly died beyond any doubt.</p>
 <p>With this, the remaining two Martial Saint stopped. Qing Shui secretly felt relieved in his heart. If the three of them suddenly attacked together when he was fighting with Ba Donghe, the consequences would have been very severe.</p>
 <p>When Ba Donghe saw that Qing Shui had killed another one of his men, he was angered to the point where he shouted loudly and used his blood-red sword to send out a dark red shadow to hack at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not dare to be careless, he held the Big Dipper Sword and used the strongest attack he knew, the Sword of Fifth Wave!</p>
 <p>Art of Pursuing!</p>
 <p>The 20 % increase in weight and the 20 % decrease in speed were not comfortable things to feel!</p>
 <p>Binding Talisman!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui only decreased the opponent’s speed, then used the State of One with Elephant clash with the opponent. Qing Shui was waiting for an opportunity, his heart was excited.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui was also anxious, it was easy for him to hit the body of his opponent, however, the most important thing was that his attack was slightly lower than the opponent’s defense. Thus, when the effects of the Seven Star Armored Vest passed, he would not be able to tolerate the slightest bit of carelessness.</p>
 <p>“Oh! I forgot about that!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s heart was excited. Suddenly the Diamond Gigantic Elephant used the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion to rush at Ba Donghe. He did not use the Shield Attack but instead, used the Minute Subtlety.</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>When Ba Donghe’s broadsword landed on his left shoulder, Qing Shui used the Heavenly Palace’s absolute life-saving technique!</p>
 <p>A bright golden light arose from Qing Shui’s body, at the same time, the Big Dipper Sword extended towards Ba Donghe. Most importantly, he used Critical Damage.</p>
 <p>When his strength was weaker than the opponent’s defense, it would result in an increase in the lethality of the attack.</p>
 <p>Originally when Qing Shui did not use the Shield Attack, Qing Shui’s strength was about the strength of 680 countries, however, his opponent defense was more than 700 countries even after his defense was decreased.</p>
 <p>Critical Damage: ignores 20 % of the target’s defense, when the target’s defense is higher that the user’s attack, directly ignores half the defense…...</p>
 <p>Directly ignoring half of the opponent’s defenses!</p>
 <p>“Pu!”</p>
 <p>The strength of 680 countries turned into a life threatening strength! The Big Dipper Sword struck the armor that protected Ba Donghe’s chest. The strength of 680 countries caused all his organs to rupture.</p>
 <p>Before Ba Donghe died, he looked at Qing Shui incredulously, his eyes were bewildered. Then he fell from the sky and after a long time, then there was a shattering sound.</p>
 <p>Then, Qing Shui’s gaze returned to the final two old men. The two old men’s expressions had turned ashen long ago, the youth in front of them was like a demon.</p>
