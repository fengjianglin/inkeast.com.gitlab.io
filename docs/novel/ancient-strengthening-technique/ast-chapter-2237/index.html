 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2237 - Relationship Confirmed, Intimate</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No matter what happens, I'll never let you leave my side."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's words rang out softly next to Beihuang Fan's ears. She wrapped her hands around Qing Shui's neck and lifted her head to look at him. Her beautiful eyes were like the brightest and most beautiful black gemstones, her long lashes exuding a great charm. Her beauty was astonishing and she looked at Qing Shui without blinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only a three-inch gap between them and so Qing Shui could clearly sense Beihuang Fan's fragrant exhaling that brushed his face. Her upright nose was right before him. However, Qing Shui was acting very proper now. He would like to kiss her, but he realized that he had lost the courage to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman made him feel at a loss and a little hesitant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of Beihuang Fan's words from earlier, as well as what he had said, there was a little change that had occurred to his mental state. If he didn't take another step forward, he might make her even sadder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui slowly got closer. He did so very, very slowly, giving time for Beihuang Fan to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even though Beihuang Fan's face flushed up, she didn't dodge. Her eyes narrowed slightly, her long lashes kept trembling. This showed that she wasn't feeling very calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He kissed those graceful lips, and the tender and fragrant feeling filled up his entire body. Qing Shui gently sucked and bit on her tender lips softly, his two hands embracing her tightly, making it such that there were no gaps between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The familiar pressure came from his chest with an astonishing bounce to them. Qing Shui's hand stroked her back gently, calming her down. He then skillfully pried open her teeth and quickly entered that sweet space, entangling with her tongue and sucking on it greedily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan's body trembled slightly. Qing Shui kissed while caressing her. His hands had a magical power even if he didn't perform the Soft-Tendon Hand Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Beihuang Fan was only standing because Qing Shui was hugging her. Qing Shui let go of the lips from the panting Beihuang Fan, but his kiss landed on her nose, cheeks, eyes, and that tender neck. When Qing Shui sucked on her glistening earlobes, Beihuang Fan's body twitched and she hugged Qing Shui tightly. With the thing that had happened earlier, in addition to the last push at the back, Beihuang Fan exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint and strange scent was sent out, and Qing Shui once again smelled this familiar aroma. It came the other time as well, but he didn't say anything. She really was a great piece of work. To think that she had such wonderful fragrance. This was Primordial Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her beautiful face was flushed red, and she rested in Qing Shui's chest, not daring to raise her head. She once again felt as if she were going to fly. She knew that this was a feeling that one could only get when a man and a woman were together. However, she had yet to become a true woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the thought of this, she felt a little strange. Would there come a day where she'd live under one roof with a man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't move anymore but just hugged her silently. He thought about a lot of things and there were times he didn't know if he was right. He had no idea why just like how it was now. Earlier on, the reason why Beihuang Fan was angry was because of a mental state, an attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Qing Shui had made his attitude clear. It could be because his action of biting her earlier was too flippant. Until now, Qing Shui still felt a little in a trance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan raised her head and looked at Qing Shui, "Were you angry earlier?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui shook his head, "I wasn't. I just felt my heart aching. It was very upsetting to see you crying. I had wanted to treat you as my woman from a long time ago, that's why I treated you like that. I admit that I'm very frivolous, but I don't do this to every woman."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You dare say that? What did you do to me on our first encounter? Don't tell me that you liked me since the first time we met?" Beihuang Fan was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I was also very shocked the first time I met you. I'm very strange. I don't have a strong heart but when I saw you, I really liked you. I don't know why either." Qing Shui smiled awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan smiled and looked at Qing Shui. "I might have owed you in my previous life. I even suspected that I neither liked men nor women, as I've been in the Divine Connection Realm for very long, thinking that I won't ever have a breakthrough in this lifetime. Because, to attain a breakthrough I would require to fall in love with a guy. I've attained a breakthrough now. Are you happy?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I am. It's not because you've attained a breakthrough, but for having a beautiful woman like you falling in love with me." Qing Shui hugged her even tighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm going to change my clothes. I don't feel very comfortable." Beihuang Fan said in a very soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then tell me, did you feel very good earlier?" Qing Shui smiled and said next to her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not saying!" Beihuang Fan said, embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It smells very nice somewhere. Do you smell it?" Qing Shui said next to her ear softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You aren't allowed to say it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then tell me if it felt good earlier. If you don't say, I'm going to touch." Qing Shui enjoyed this feeling. He knew that the burden in Beihuang Fan had been removed and their relationship was confirmed now. They were only short of a formality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For existences like themselves, formality wasn't important. It was more important that they liked each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll say it. You aren't allowed to move!" Beihuang Fan quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It felt good..." Beihuang Fan's voice was like that of an insect next to Qing Shui's ears. However, the charm in her voice made Qing Shui numb all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui now felt very amazing, having a great sense of achievement. He carried Beihuang Fan in his arms and spun a few rounds before placing her down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others left, and so did Beihuang Fan. She had attained a breakthrough and headed back to stabilize her realm. Another thing was that she wanted to continue to attempt further breakthroughs. She had been in the Divine Connection Realm for too long, and she would probably obtain a further breakthrough within a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that there had been someone who had reached ten caves before achieving breakthroughs to the greater realms thereafter. However, there were also people who managed to attain breakthroughs for the realms later after reaching one cave. If one wasn't willing to, they could forever stay at their current realm if they didn't intentionally try to break through to later realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Heavenly Dao Realm, and the more caves one achieved at the Cave Realm, the stronger they would become when they achieved the later realms. It was the same for their foundation. Therefore, most people would stop there for a very long time and would continue to break through after reaching four caves. After all, the caves at the later phase were increasingly harder to achieve, and they couldn't possibly spend a large part of their lives onto them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui also needed to study the Cave Realm. This time around, the breakthrough came very suddenly. Moreover, there was one cave that was golden and the other two which weren't. The golden cave seemed a lot stronger than the other two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, Qing Shui looked at the three caves behind him. The mysterious caves had something like a vortex that was foggy and glistening, tempering Qing Shui's body and replenishing it with Origin Qi incessantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui's body also seemed to be tempering the caves. However, he suddenly discovered that his Dantian was unlike how it was before. He hadn't noticed this previously. The Dantian was now also a cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a violet-golden cave...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The violet-golden cave had boiling violet molten lava, with violet electricity darting about. His Divine Weapon Flying Sword, the Emperor Qi's Pellet, the Five Elements Divine Flags, and the paragon vessel were all inside, receiving great nourishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Qing Shui had one more thing to cultivate—his caves. He was going to explore more caves. The fourth cave already had a structure and although it was very faint, it should be created very soon.</span></p>
