The old man revealed a joyful look on his face. It’s just that Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd also happened to land on his shoulder. The formidable power of the Golden Battle Halberd immediately crushed the shoulder of a warrior who was at the Divine Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s strength was at the Divine Grade. However, his defensive prowess was only considered decent. Added on the ability of Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd to ignore the opponent’s defensive prowess, the old man’s shoulder was immediately crushed into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man looked at Qing Shui. If he could manage to kill Qing Shui with this strike, it would be worth it even if it meant that he would lose one arm. But he soon realized that Qing Shui was in perfect shape. As that happened, his eyes were filled with disbelief. He tried his hardest to blink his eyes only to find that things were things were still the same. He was in perfect shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, the clumsy old man whose position was switched with Qing Shui’s Great Reversal once again charged his way back towards Qing Shui. But upon witnessing the scene in front of him, he was struck by an intense feeling of helplessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s Golden Battle Halberd immediately smashed the old man’s heart and crushed it into pieces. When you decided to take part in this game, you would need to be ready to pay the price. Being generous to opponents was equivalent to being cruel to yourself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, Qing Shui didn’t hesitate to eliminate the old man. After that, he immediately charged his way towards the elderly man, who was spaced out. The two old men Qing Shui were facing were the weakest ones among the group in terms of strength. It’s very easy for Qing Shui to kill the two Divine Grade warriors who had already lost their will to fight. These warriors were no longer Divine existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s tyrannical attacks combined with his Dragon Slaying Beast. For a moment, it gave a Divine Grade Warrior a feeling that he was fragile. This was how Qing Shui was so powerful. A Divine Grade Warrior at elementary level was right away crippled in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Qing Shui finishing off the old men, the tide of the battle could be considered to finally have been turned.. At the very least, they had managed to win back their initial disadvantage in terms of numbers. By now, Feng Xi had also taken care of the opponents on her side. At the moment, Hong Hong and Hong Gu were the only ones left on the field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Qing Shui’s side, there were four of them, just like from the beginning. None of them were dead. They weren’t even injured. This kind of discrepancy put a huge amount of pressure on Hong Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eight Divine Warriors had died, although they were all only at elementary level. The strongest one among the people who had taken part in the battle was only a peak First grade Divine Warrior. Despite that, the Hong Clan had basically sent out all their Divine warriors available.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were only very few Divine Warriors in the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. As one of the top-notch aristocratic clans, the Hong Clan was almost the Yin Clan’s equal. In terms of the amount of clan members they had, they even had an upper-hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eight... the death of eight Divine Warriors had caused HOng Clan to regret what they did. Even if they won, the amount of things which they gained could never make up for their losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One small mistake had led to the demise of their entire clan. Their initial plan was to take over the position of Divine Moon Immortal Sect’s Sect Lord. After that, they could use the most convenient resources available in the clan. From there, the Hong Clan would definitely rise up by another level, so much so that they might even advance into the deeper part of Haohan Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Money often came from danger. Taking risks would always be in direct proportion with the possible rewards. This time, the Hong Clan made up their mind to risk this opportunity only to find that the they had lost the game which they were extremely certain they would win. They lost everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Man Wang, Feng Xi and Yin Cha all let out a sigh of relief. Though the two most powerful Hong Clan members were still on the stage, they were already able to see signs of their victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is such a shocking outcome…… There are only two members from Hong Clan left…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The remaining two participants are their strongest warriors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does it matter? All the eight other members who died were Divine Warriors. Eight of them, and they were all Dao Sovereigns! This might possibly be one of the greatest losses the Divine Moon Immortal Sect suffered. Those were basically all of the Divine Grade Warriors in the Hong Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that there is still one more Dao Sovereign at the Divine Grade left in Hong Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Hong Clan is finished. The Yin Clan only sent out four people. The battle has only gone on for a while and they have already managed to finish off eight Divine Sovereigns. Eight of them! They were no ordinary people to mess with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though the battle might seem easy and straightforward, only Qing Shui and the other three people knew about the risk in it. If it wasn’t because of mistakes by their opponents, the outcome of the battle might still be undecided. In some extreme cases, Qing Shui’s side would have most certainly lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui might have formidable abilities, but he would also need expert warriors to support him. Old Man Wang, Feng Xi and Yin Cha were precisely the expert warriors in this context. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to fight the match. If there had been no one there to hold back Hong Hong and Hong Gu, Qing Shui wouldn’t have lasted this long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was standing on a spot quite distant away from them. By now, the situation had changed to the Yin Clan besieging the Hong Clan. At this moment, Qing Shui informed Feng Xi and Yin Cha to think of a way to make the Hong brothers separate away from each other, so that Old Man Wang would only have to deal with either Hong Hong and Hong Gu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, things would work out even if they were to face their opponents straight on. Qing Shui was only worried about accidents which might occur. Meanwhile, the Thunderous Beast constantly unleashed its Thunderbolt attack from a distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing the Thunderous Beast was doing was similar to cooking a frog with warm water. Initially, the influence it brought upon to the battle might be really insignificant, but by the time the opponent realized something was wrong, everything would be too late. There would be no more turning back for the warrior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Patriarchs from the Hong Clan were aware of how powerful this could be. At the moment, no one dared to underestimate anything which Qing Shui unleashed. Hence, the outcome was very easy to figure out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Hong Hong and Hong Gu would hold a grudge towards this kind of conclusion. Even if they knew that it’s almost impossible to change the outcome, they were still willing to give it a try. Otherwise, the Hong Clan be totally done for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two brothers were sharing the same thought. As for Old Man Wang, he could do nothing but try his best to hold on. This was what he had been doing since the beginning. Furthermore, he had three demonic beasts helping him hold off his opponents. Otherwise, Old Man Wang would have long passed his limit by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Old Man Wang might seem fine from the outside, the exhaustion he had suffered across his body was still quite significant. He was almost at his limit. Before the battle started, Qing Shui had given him a few Vital Essence Pills. For a warrior at this level, though it might not recover his strength fully, it could still replenish almost half of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, things were a little different. Feng Xi and Yin Cha joined in the battle. Before this, with Feng Xi’s Sleeves Reversal, he managed to battle against the old men with relative ease. But now, unlike before, he must act more cautiously. One careless mistake might cost him his very own life. When two experts crossed fists, not even the slightest flaw could be allowed. As the saying went ‘A little error may lead to a huge discrepancy”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of strength, Yin Cha was almost Feng Xi’s equal. At the end of the day, he was still the Divine Moon Immortal Sect’s Sect Lord. For the past few days, Qing Shui’s Constitution Nurturing and medicinal pills had helped significantly boost his strength. This was what Qing Shui was capable of, particularly for the people who had never received help from him before. The amount of benefits they could gain from their first experiences with it would be immeasurable. Old Man Wang, Feng Xi, and Yin Cha, all three of them, had experienced significant boosts in their strength. As for Yin Tian, his very life was saved by Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Hong and Hong Gu, who didn’t manage to suppress their opponents since the beginning, found it even more impossible to do so now. However, for warriors who have already reached their level, they were bound to have things they specialized in. This kind of specialized move tended to be very easily unleashed through suicidal methods. They contained formidable strength and would never be used unless a warrior was really out of options. It was also for this very reason that Qing Shui felt that it was of utmost importance to take out one of them as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From time to time, Qing Shui would release his Five Elements Divine Refining Technique to bother his opponents. The Five Elements Divine Refining Technique was something that even Hong Hong and Hong Gu didn’t dare look down on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Force of Roots!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Hong Hong charged towards Qing Shui like a bolt of thunder. Deep down, Hong Hong and Hong Gu knew that only by killing the young man in front of them would they have a chance of turning back the tide of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s until this moment that Qing Shui finally came back to his senses. He knew that he had nowhere to escape from Hong Hong and Hong Gu. Hence, he immediately let the Thunderous Beast unleash its Violet Lightning Strike. He also transmitted a message to Old Man Wang, telling him to kill his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

At the same time, his body started shining with a golden light. He summoned his Nine Continents Mountain and placed it in between himself and Hong Hong. But it was as if Hong Hong was aware that he wouldn’t be able to kill Qing Shui with one strike and he once again charged his way towards Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To think that it would trigger Qing Shui’s Paragon Golden Armor’s Death Prevention Golden Armor. This old man must have used his Paragon Heavenly Technique. Otherwise, his attacks wouldn’t have contained so much power. One notable thing was that Qing Shui’s current defensive prowess was almost at the level of First level Divine Grade. Hong Hong’s strength should be around the peak of First Level Divine Grade as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Man Wang clenched his teeth and immediately dashed forward. The wide bloody sword in his hand emitted an aura resembling that of a surging bloody spring. It carried along in the shape of a half moon as it sliced through Hong Gu’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Moon Demonic Sabre!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xi and Yin Cha immediately charged towards Qing Shui. At this moment, both of them started to worry. Qing Shui must be kept safe. Though the Yin Clan was considered stable at the moment, nothing must happen to Qing Shui. Otherwise, the things which happened today would have lost their meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched as Hong Hong blew apart the Nine Continents Mountain in his way. The sharp sword in his hand was also considered a semi Divine Weapon. He once again pointed his sword towards QIng Shui and made his way towards him. Qing Shui’s body was immobilized. He couldn’t run away no matter how hard he resisted. The Nine Palace Step could be seen constantly glowing, but the opponent was like a shadow which whose shape followed the movement of its host. Qing Shui knew that he had been immobilized by a unique Battle Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Slaying Beast leaped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

It’s unknown whether it suffered injuries. Similar to Rain-Drizzling Bird, the Dragon Slaying Beast lacked speed. The only thing it could do was to attempt sneak attacks, otherwise, it would only suffer the fate of being beaten up by opponents stronger than itself. However, because of its unique body, it’s not that easy to kill the Dragon Slaying Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demon Binding Rope!</span></p>

All this time, he was clear-headed and knew what he had to do. But despite this, he was still not confident with what would happen. Their difference in strength was too significant. Though his formidable defensive prowess could enable him to block against normal attacks, he still wouldn’t be able to block against a Sure-kill Heavenly Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui watched as the long sword got closer and closer to him. The long sword looked like a mini version of the sun. The tip was brimming with dazzling light, a light which could compete against the bright moon in the sky as it emitted an fearsome force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!”</span></p>

A scorching heat started spreading across his body. The painful sensation as well as the scorching aura which Qing Shui felt made him felt like he had been placed in a purgatory. The internal part of his body felt like boiling water. The unbearable pain he felt instantly caused his body to be soaked in sweat. At the same time, his blood also mixed in his sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden light appeared from Qing Shui’s chest and sunk into Hong Hong’s brain. This time, Qing Shui didn’t actually summon the Marrow Nibbling Golden Dragon Silkworm. The reason why it came out of its own accord was because the tiny beast felt a huge threat when the sword almost destroyed his Central Palace Blood Essence Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Hong felt an indescribable pain and was stunned. Qing Shui quickly moved back but Hong Hong held on. He clenched his teeth and as he moved his arm, almost all of Qing Shui’s organs were crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fresh blood could be seen shooting out of his nose and mouth. These were the heaviest injuries which Qing Shui had been inflicted with throughout his entire life. Yin Cha immediately rushed over. However, at the same time, Hong Hong could be seen holding his head in his hand. He had never expected for the brat to have a killer-move reserved even at a time like this. Not only so, it wasn’t any normal killer-move, but a fatal one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s consciousness started to get blurry. Meanwhile, the Yin-yang Image within his Sea of Consciousness began revolving at a very fast speed. Qing Shui could vaguely see the two girls running towards the direction he was at. Tantai Lingyan, who had always been very cold to everyone ,actually cried… He felt like he also saw tears coming out of Qin Qing’s eyes.</span></p>
