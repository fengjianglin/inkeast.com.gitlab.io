 <p><strong>AST 350 Qing Shui Arrived At Skysword Sect, Wenren Wu-shuang Returns to Hundred Miles City</strong></p>
 <p><span>Before she could finish her words, Qing Shui had already planted a kiss on those sexy lips, sucking it wildly!</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Qing returned the kiss passionately, eyes closed. Her small tongue entangling with Qing Shui's. One could tell from her passionate actions how much she had missed Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span>His two hands climbed up from the slender waist to that perky round butt, caressing and feeling the soft and bouncy perk. At the same time, his hands were squeezing it closer towards himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui wanted to devour her as he crazily planted kisses on her face, neck, ears, and even buried his face into that two mountain peaks.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui, carry me into the room!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui swept her off her feet and kicked open the door to the bedroom!</span></p>
 <p><span>On the soft bed, the clean and pink colored bedsheets let out an alluring charm. Qing Shui had been lit up, and very quickly, they both took off their clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span>...</span></p>
 <p><span>Her gaze was clear yet seductive, with hints of a shy and stubborn feeling. However, when engaged in the most embarrassing act with Qing Shui, the gaze she showed was only the shyness of a mature lady with a slight hint of expectation.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Expectation, what was she expecting?" Qing Shui was slightly puzzled as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Qing Shui!" Zhu Qing gasped and said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Mmm, are you feeling comfortable? Tell me if there's anything you're not satisfied with." Qing Shui grinned and said.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhu Qing's face turned even more red, and that moment of tender charm had caused Qing Shui to fall into a daze. When a woman was having sex, the charm exuded was especially attractive and the beauty was incomparable.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shall we do it like the previous time?" Zhu Qing's voice was so soft that it almost could not be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span>The other time? Qing Shui tried to recall. The other time, he was also using this Duo Cultivation technique. Oh, that's right, the other time when they were together, he had almost used all the postures he had known of.</span></p>
 <p><span>Could it be that she liked to do it in various postures?</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui's blood boiled at the mere thought of it, turning Zhu Qing over and raising her perky snow white butt high up...</span></p>
 <p><span>The provocating cries in the room persisted for close to two hours!</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Qing Shui knew that he should be heading for the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. He wanted to give himself a day off, but he knew he should not do that. The Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal was his greatest advantage, and if it was taken away from him, how would he be able to make a stand in the world of the nine continents? Moreover, there were still important things waiting for him to do, and he could not afford to slack.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, Qing Shui recalled that he had yet to look for Wenren Wu-shuang after having returned for so long!</span></p>
 <p><span>"Is Wu-shuang well? I've yet to visit her yet." Qing Shui casually asked Zhu Qing who was in his arms with closed eyes, feeling satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ahh, Wu-shuang had left ten days ago. She said that she had something to settle." Zhu Qing opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What? Went back? How did she go back?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui was extremely shocked and asked anxiously . It was only then that he realized how important the quiet lady who had made him want to address her as elder sister was to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"She said something happened at home and needed to rush back immediately, taking my "White Vermillion Bird"! I wanted to accompany her, but she had rejected my offer."</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui knew that it was bad. It could only mean that something had happened to Wenren Wugou, and it was not anything good. She was an elementary Xiantian cultivator... If there was a Xiantian cultivator of a higher level...</span></p>
 <p><span>The White Vermillion Bird's speed was not slow. It had been ten days since he left and he did not know if his fire bird could catch up to her if he were to rush back now. However, he still needed to go after her.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Qing Shui thoughts circulated very quickly!</span></p>
 <p><span>"I must go back! Wu-shuang may be in trouble!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui rejected Zhu Qing's kind intention of going back with him. He put on his clothes, gave her a kiss, and told her to tell Yiye Jiange the next day that he had gone back, and tell Yiye Jiange not to worry. He then left amidst her complicated and worrying gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span>He took the fire bird and rushed to Earthly Paradise. Qing Shui prayed that Wenren Wu-shuang was fine, and that her sister was fine as well. If not, Qing Clan would be in danger as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>Thinking about it, Qing Shui could not help but break out in a cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui landed at Earthly Paradise and, without a word, sensed the room the two ladies were in with his Spiritual Sense. Thank goodness, the two of them were in the same room. He only needed to rushed to one room.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui banged on the door and slammed the door open with a quick greeting!</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the two ladies were still given a shock from Qing Shui's barbarous behavior. Qing Shui was not in the mood to appreciate the appearances of the two ladies, especially not Canghai Mingyue's divinely beautiful appearance without any makeup. He had not even noticed that Huoyun Liu-Li was not wearing a face mask, that her face was perfectly healed, and that she was even more beautiful than how she was previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>"I have something urgent to attend to and need to return immediately. Do you guys want to head back with me on my fire bird now or wait until tomorrow, since Liu-Li knows the way." Qing Shui cut right to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue's beautiful face looked at Qing Shui for a while then said, "Qing Shui, you can go back first. Liu-Li and I will follow-up later. You be careful!"</span></p>
 <p><span>To Canghai Mingyue's understanding, Qing Shui smiled and nodded. He ignored the fact that they were in bed and grabbed the two ladies' hands, quickly leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue knew that Qing Shui needed to rush back immediately, and that hers and Liu-Li's abilities were no longer of much help to him. They could not add on to his burdens.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the fire bird's back, Qing Shui entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal with no delay. He only had to tell the fire bird the wind direction! He also told the fire bird with his Spiritual Sense to check for the White Vermillion Bird's tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hundred Miles City.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ Clan's arrogance was even greater than ever before. With a cultivator who was at the pinnacle of Xiantian, who would in Hundred Miles City would dare go against them? They snatched back the properties they had previously been forced to let go of, and those who had struck them when they were down now were all given even harsher treatments.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ Clan was making an example of them to Qing Clan, Shi Clan, and Yu Clan!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>With Situ Clan's current abilities, they could wipe out all the major clans in Hundred Miles City very quickly. However, Situ Clan did not feel satisfied with that. They wanted to go about it very slowly. They wanted to let them feel the torture, then throw them into depression.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Clan!</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone was frowning, especially Qing Yi. She knew that something had happened in Night Fragrance Court, and she knew that Wu-shuang, who was with her son, was the younger sister of the head of the Night Fragrance Court.</span></p>
 <p><span>But now, Qing Clan's strongest person was Mingyue Gelou, and Qing Yi did not wish to put her in danger. She was also her son's woman, and Qing Yi could see that long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span>There was no way that Situ Clan would let Qing Clan off. Qing Shui killed that Xiantian expert from Situ Clan back then. If Situ Clan wanted to rise again, they would need to use Qing Clan as a stepping stone.</span></p>
 <p><span>Furthermore, Situ Clan's greatest humilation was when Qing Clan had forcefully snatched Shi Qingzhuang. What they wanted was the process!</span></p>
 <p><span>In a mere half a month's time, Situ Clan disintegrated a few of the properties belonging to the few major clans, including Qing Clan. At the same time, they showed to everyone Situ Clan's strong abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was because the Xiantian elementary expert, Yu Donghao, was not killed in their hands, but was seriously injured. It was good that Situ Clan was only trying to show off their prowess to Qing Clan, Yu Clan, and Shi Clan, and had not killed Yu Donghao.</span></p>
 <p><span>After knowing their abilities, the other clans could only repeatedly hold it in, and even Mingyue Gelou was not allowed to step out. It was because everyone in Hundred Miles City knew that the two experts from Situ Clan were especially lecherous. Just during this short period, they had already played with quite a number of ladies in Hundred Miles City openly, in broad daylight. Those who stepped in their way were all killed directly, and there was even a family who had been wiped out&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Now, many people were constantly on tenterhooks, no longer daring to speak a word despite the fury they felt!</span></p>
 <p><span>"What? Martial Brother, you're saying that Qing Clan now has a female Xiantian cultivator and is very young and beautiful?" Li Long looked at Situ Shang in astonishment. He had not been satisfied as of late. The ladies they fooled around with had not raised much of his interest. But now, hearing that there was a female Xiantian cultivator, he was once again excited. And to think that she was young and beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span>Very quickly, Li Long and Yan Xu got their hands on a lot of information related to Mingyue Gelou, even a painting of her. Seeing that saintly and well-embodied beautiful lady, their heightened excitement was even more now.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Martial Brother, how about getting her to work for your family?" He had long been addressing him as Martial Brother instead of Situ Martial Brother. This goes to show that they had gotten closer with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It's already late today. We'll go to Qing Clan to take a look at the Xiantian beauty!" Li Long looked at Yan Xu and Situ Shang and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feeling that he had not been visually satisfied recently, he was suddenly not anxious when knowing that there was such a high quality lady. Delicacies would taste better when slowly appreciated.</span></p>
 <p><span>The next morning, a giant White Vermillion Bird came to Hundred Miles City. It was Wenren Wu-shuang who had rushed back, and her targeted location was Night Fragrance Court.</span></p>
 <p><span>She attracted a lot of attention in the air, and news spread quickly. After all, the White Vermillion Bird was also a mutated beast, and while it was not comparable to Qing Shui's fire bird, it was also a Xiantian flying beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>She landed straight at Night Fragrance Court's entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span>Wenren Wu-shuang could not wait and quickly jumped off the White Vermillion Bird. There were now many fresh faces, but still mostly ladies she knew from previously. Most of these people were forced by Situ Clan to stay here.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Second Miss!" Someone called out in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hearing the shout, the ladies who knew of Wenren Wu-shuang all looked at the anxious and beautiful lady. Their faces paled in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span>Wenren Wu-shuang!</span></p>
 <p><span>"She's the younger sister of that lady who got played to death!" Suddenly, a lady's happy voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Quick, someone go tell Young Master Situ. Tell him that the lady they are waiting for is back."</span></p>
 <p><span>"The younger sister of that lady who got played to death..."</span></p>
