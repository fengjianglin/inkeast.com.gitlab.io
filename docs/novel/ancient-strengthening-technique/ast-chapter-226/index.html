  <p><strong>AST 226 Being in Pain Yet Feeling Happy!!!</strong></p>
  <p>When Canghai saw the young man’s appearance, especially that gaze which was filled with lust and desire, he felt annoyed, but helpless.</p>
  <p>“Brother Fu, you’ve come. Come, come, take a seat!” Canghai grinned, pulled the middle-aged man’s arms passionately and said.</p>
  <p>“Mingyue, who is this?” When the young man saw Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui standing intimately together, holding hands, he could not help but frown and ask. After all, he knew that Canghai Mingyue was the only child in her family.</p>
  <p>“Oh, she’s my wife, so who do you think I am?” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Wife? Mingyue, how could you be his wife?” The young man shouted uncontrollably, blood shooting up onto his handsome fair skin.</p>
  <p>“Brother Canghai, this is?” The valiant middle-aged man said weirdly.</p>
  <p>“Brother Fu, Mingyue is often away from home. When she came back this time, she told us that she was already married to Qing Shui… ”</p>
  <p>Hearing Canghai’s words, the valiant middle-aged man’s face turned pale while the young man looked at Canghai Mingyue with a slightly twisted face. His bloodshot face appeared to be a bit sinister.</p>
  <p>“You can only belong to me, Fu Long. I must definitely have you for myself.” When the young man entered, he still appeared slightly elegant. But when he saw Canghai Mingyue and Qing Shui holding hands intimately, and especially when he heard Canghai say that Canghai Mingyue was married to this fellow, he was even more infuriated.</p>
  <p>“You, you… Have I ever said that I want to be married to you?” Canghai Mingyue said furiously.</p>
  <p>“Yueyue, don’t be angry, it’s not worth it. Be careful, if you don’t, you’ll hurt the baby.” Qing Shui gently patted Canghai Mingyue’s tender back.</p>
  <p>Hearing this, the young man was shocked and Canghai Mingyue also choked. This rascal dared to say anything he likes. The other time he said that it was time to feed the baby… this time he said that she has his child…</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue was so embarrassed that she buried her face into Qing Shui’s chest, but she bit him. She could not hold it in. If she did not bite him, she would feel uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui gently wrapped his hands around her slender waist. He finally understood what it meant by being in pain yet feeling happy!</p>
  <p>“Brother Canghai, you didn’t invite your brother to your daughter’s wedding, and you didn’t tell us anything about it thereafter. You really are not treating me as your brother!” The valiant middle-aged man said with a black face, feeling slightly infuriated.</p>
  <p>“Brother Fu, your elder brother had made a promise to you to let Yueyue and Long’ Er to be together. This time around, take it as your elder brother not making good of his promise!” Canghai smiled bitterly and said.</p>
  <p>“Forget it. It was merely a joke which I took seriously. Long’ Er, let’s go!” The valiant middle-aged man sighed and said.</p>
  <p>“I want to challenge you. Whoever loses will need to leave Mingyue.” Fury burned in the young man’s heart when he saw Qing Shui and Canghai Mingyue acting so intimately together.</p>
  <p>Actually, Qing Shui was still stunned by Canghai’s words, which was that he had agreed previously to let Canghai Mingyue be with this young man. Logically speaking, someone like Canghai would definitely not take control of his daughter’s marriage. Could it be that there was some hidden secret?</p>
  <p>“Mingyue is my woman, why would I need to accept your challenge? Moreover, women are not objects, they are not something which we can give up to each other.” Qing Shui grinned and said.</p>
  <p>“Coward!”</p>
  <p>“Idiot!” Qing Shui did not hesitate as he rebutted!</p>
  <p>Towards such people, Qing Shui would not act refine and say that he would not stoop down to his leve. Towards such people, it would be more effective to use even stronger words to hurt him!</p>
  <p>“You dare scold me?” The young man furiously looked at Qing Shui.</p>
  <p>“If you continue to harbor ideas for my woman, I wouldn’t mind to give you a beating.” Qing Shui did not look at the young man as he said softly.</p>
  <p>“Haha, beat me up? Come! If I don’t bash you up today, then I haven’t brought up by humans.” The young man laughed. He did not even dare to accept his challenge earlier, and now, he is blatantly saying that he wants to beat himself up!</p>
  <p>Just as the young man finished his words, Qing Shui incorporated the Crane’s Might into the Free Spirit Steps, and as he applied the Crane Form, he lashed a Tiger Tailwhip Kick out at the speed of lightning. Ever since Qing Shui first killed a 4th grade Xiantian cultivator with this move, he had practiced it endlessly for millions of time.</p>
  <p>Bang!</p>
  <p>Qing Shui landed the kick on the young man’s Dan Tian. Without even the time for a grunt, the young man was sent flying. Qing Shui recalled Canghai saying that it would be fine so long as he was not killed.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had initially planned to injure him, but after hearing him saying ‘not brought up by humans’, Qing Shui wanted to kill him. But, he remembered Canghai’s words, and thus he could only let him live. So he ended up making him suffer a fate worse than death.</p>
  <p>Blood flew out from the young man’s, Fu Long’ mouth and nose. The moment he was sent flying, the valiant man swiftly moved out to catch him. After a taking a quick look, he turned his gaze towards Qing Shui, his eyes were as if they were spewing flames.</p>
  <p>Canghai was also feeling bitter. He had not expected Qing Shui to cripple the other party. It was worse than killing him. For a Xiantian cultivator to suddenly be reduced to an ordinary person, there were not many who could withstand such a huge blow.</p>
  <p>Other than the young man, who had fainted and Qing Shui, the rest all stared at Qing Shui stunned, while the valiant man’s gaze was full of killing intent.</p>
  <p>“Brother Fu, quickly take Long’ Er to the Tang Clan to have his injuries attended to.” Canghai Mingyue’s mother quickly went up and said worriedly.</p>
  <p>The valiant man took a long look at Qing Shui, before whistling towards the air. In a moment, a flying beast, that was like a gigantic black hawk, descended and the valiant man leaped up.</p>
  <p>“Young man, this isn’t over yet!” The valiant man left theseword and quickly dashed off!</p>
  <p>As soon as he left, Canghai Mingyue immediately let go of Qing Shui and looked at him weirdly. Even the Canghai couple were looking at him seriously.</p>
  <p>“Why did you cripple him?” Canghai said, slightly bitterly.</p>
  <p>“If it wasn’t for Senior saying not to kill him, I would have taken his life.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked at Canghai seriously.</p>
  <p>“Daddy, why did you say earlier that you had agreed for me and Fu Long to be together? What was that?” Canghai Mingyue asked softly.</p>
  <p>“Cough! Let’s go to my room first before we discuss this.” Canghai sighed.</p>
  <p>All of them headed towards the lounge, Canghai Mingyue’s mother brewed a pot of tea and poured a cup for everyone. Qing Shui did not know much about tea appreciation, but he still felt that the taste of this tea was not bad. It was light, fragrant, and very refreshing.</p>
  <p>Canghai took a sip of tea before he said softly, “That middle-aged valiant man is Fu Xing. I’ve known him for a few decades. Back then, I had not even reached Xiantian but I had killed a profligate son and I was sought out by their clan’s Xiantian experts. It was Fu Xing’s father who had saved me and allowed me to become sworn brothers with his son Fu Xing. This way, I became half his son, and his protection for me would be justified.”</p>
  <p>Canghai smiled bitterly as he said this, and continued after taking another sip of tea, “I owe my life to Old Master Fu, and I am sworn brothers with Fu Xing. Thereafter, I met Yueyue’s mother Ruo Tong, but it was unfortunate that both Fu Xing and myself had both fallen in love with Ruo Tong.”</p>
  <p>Canghai Mingyue looked at her slightly embarrassed mother as she blinked beautiful eyes which were like stars!</p>
  <p>“In the end, I married Yueyue’s mother, but I knew that a barrier was formed between us brothers. Moreover, he still could not forget about Ruo Tong, so I could only leave with her. It was just that before I left, Fu Xing said something, and without thinking much about it, I agreed.”</p>
  <p>“In the future, if the each of our first child were both sons, they would be brothers. If they were both daughters, they would be sisters. And if one of them was a son while the other was a daughter, we’ll let them be together.” Canghai smiled bitterly as he looked at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui had finally seen for himself an example of an engagement agreement before the child was even born. In the world of the nine continents, the people held promises in high regard. In addition, Canghai owed Fu Clan a debt he could never repay. However, why was it that Canghai had said that it was fine so long as he didn’t kill that young man? Canghai did not seem like a heartless man.</p>
  <p>“Fu Long was originally a smart and handsome child from a young age, and our families would meet once every three years. Even if when he grew up, I still had a favorable impression of him. However, the reason I had agreed for both of you to put up an act in front of them and allowed Qing Shui to do as he wish so long as Fu Long was not killed, is because I saw him rape and kill a commoner lady and then killed her whole family for myself . At that time, I wanted very much to kill that beast, but I had a debt to Fu Clan which I could never return, and thus I couldn’t.” Canghai squinted his eyes, as if he was recalling his memories.</p>
  <p>“Beast, he’s better off dead!” Canghai Mingyue said furiously.</p>
  <p>“Qing Shui, rest assured, I will not let him do as he wishes with you. When we got you into this, we didn’t think that things would turn out this way.” Canghai didn’t expect Qing Shui to cripple Fu Long, and with just one move. But that kick was really like a Flood Dragon emerging from the seas, so it wasn’t tough to defeat an 8th grade Xiantian expert who was caught unaware. Moreover, the Dan Tian was a warrior’s weakest point. If that kick was at full force, it could kill.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui knew that the Tiger Tailwhip Kick had such an impact partly because he had reached the small success stage for the Crane Form. If he had not reached this level for the Crane Form, it was be very likely that the other party could avoid having his Dan Tian attack or even dodged his attack completely.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui smiled awkwardly, “Senior, I’ve caused you some trouble!”</p>
  <p>“No, to be honest, I’m especially satisfied with this outcome. It was just that I feel pity for Fu Xing. He is an upright person, but to think that he has such a beast for a son.” Canghai replied in a casual tone.</p>
  <p>“Senior, how is Fu Clan’s abilities? Is Fu Xing the strongest?” Qing Shui gave it some thought before he asked Canghai.</p>
  <p>“There aren’t many people in Fu Clan, and Fu Xing is the strongest amongst them. Mmm, Fu Clan’s leader is the person in charged on Fu Jian Country.”</p>
  <p>Another head of a country, and he was a low grade Martial King expert at that. It seemed like Cang Lang Country really was the weakest in the Greencloud Continent. This made Qing Shui recall that Yang Jiang Country’s Yan City was one of the best, and he felt that the weight he was carrying on his shoulders was very heavy.</p>
  <p>Huoyun Liu-Li remained silent all this time, but she had been looking at Qing Shui worriedly. She did not know when she had start feeling worried and anxious for a guy.</p>
  <p>She herself did not really understand the relationship between herself and Qing Shui, and didn't have the courage to ask him. Most importantly, she was still not sure if she was in love with him.</p>
  <p>More often than not, she had only enjoyed to silently stand beside him, and accompany him!</p>
  <p>When they headed back, Qing Shui noticed that Canghai Mingyue’s gaze towards him was still one of evasion. He knew that his words today had offended this Young Miss. However, he was still very happy and satisfied. But, he seemed to have forgotten Huoyun Liu-Li would look towards him occasionally.</p>

 <p>“Haha, beat me up? Come! If I don’t bash you up today, then I haven’t brought up by humans.” The young man laughed. He did not even dare to accept his challenge earlier, and now, he is blatantly saying that he wants to beat himself up!</p>
 <p>Just as the young man finished his words, Qing Shui incorporated the Crane’s Might into the Free Spirit Steps, and as he applied the Crane Form, he lashed a Tiger Tailwhip Kick out at the speed of lightning. Ever since Qing Shui first killed a 4th grade Xiantian cultivator with this move, he had practiced it endlessly for millions of time.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui landed the kick on the young man’s Dan Tian. Without even the time for a grunt, the young man was sent flying. Qing Shui recalled Canghai saying that it would be fine so long as he was not killed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had initially planned to injure him, but after hearing him saying ‘not brought up by humans’, Qing Shui wanted to kill him. But, he remembered Canghai’s words, and thus he could only let him live. So he ended up making him suffer a fate worse than death.</p>
 <p>Blood flew out from the young man’s, Fu Long’ mouth and nose. The moment he was sent flying, the valiant man swiftly moved out to catch him. After a taking a quick look, he turned his gaze towards Qing Shui, his eyes were as if they were spewing flames.</p>
 <p>Canghai was also feeling bitter. He had not expected Qing Shui to cripple the other party. It was worse than killing him. For a Xiantian cultivator to suddenly be reduced to an ordinary person, there were not many who could withstand such a huge blow.</p>
 <p>Other than the young man, who had fainted and Qing Shui, the rest all stared at Qing Shui stunned, while the valiant man’s gaze was full of killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Brother Fu, quickly take Long’ Er to the Tang Clan to have his injuries attended to.” Canghai Mingyue’s mother quickly went up and said worriedly.</p>
 <p>The valiant man took a long look at Qing Shui, before whistling towards the air. In a moment, a flying beast, that was like a gigantic black hawk, descended and the valiant man leaped up.</p>
 <p>“Young man, this isn’t over yet!” The valiant man left theseword and quickly dashed off!</p>
 <p>As soon as he left, Canghai Mingyue immediately let go of Qing Shui and looked at him weirdly. Even the Canghai couple were looking at him seriously.</p>
 <p>“Why did you cripple him?” Canghai said, slightly bitterly.</p>
 <p>“If it wasn’t for Senior saying not to kill him, I would have taken his life.” Qing Shui smiled as he looked at Canghai seriously.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, why did you say earlier that you had agreed for me and Fu Long to be together? What was that?” Canghai Mingyue asked softly.</p>
 <p>“Cough! Let’s go to my room first before we discuss this.” Canghai sighed.</p>
 <p>All of them headed towards the lounge, Canghai Mingyue’s mother brewed a pot of tea and poured a cup for everyone. Qing Shui did not know much about tea appreciation, but he still felt that the taste of this tea was not bad. It was light, fragrant, and very refreshing.</p>
 <p>Canghai took a sip of tea before he said softly, “That middle-aged valiant man is Fu Xing. I’ve known him for a few decades. Back then, I had not even reached Xiantian but I had killed a profligate son and I was sought out by their clan’s Xiantian experts. It was Fu Xing’s father who had saved me and allowed me to become sworn brothers with his son Fu Xing. This way, I became half his son, and his protection for me would be justified.”</p>
 <p>Canghai smiled bitterly as he said this, and continued after taking another sip of tea, “I owe my life to Old Master Fu, and I am sworn brothers with Fu Xing. Thereafter, I met Yueyue’s mother Ruo Tong, but it was unfortunate that both Fu Xing and myself had both fallen in love with Ruo Tong.”</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue looked at her slightly embarrassed mother as she blinked beautiful eyes which were like stars!</p>
 <p>“In the end, I married Yueyue’s mother, but I knew that a barrier was formed between us brothers. Moreover, he still could not forget about Ruo Tong, so I could only leave with her. It was just that before I left, Fu Xing said something, and without thinking much about it, I agreed.”</p>
 <p>“In the future, if the each of our first child were both sons, they would be brothers. If they were both daughters, they would be sisters. And if one of them was a son while the other was a daughter, we’ll let them be together.” Canghai smiled bitterly as he looked at Canghai Mingyue.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had finally seen for himself an example of an engagement agreement before the child was even born. In the world of the nine continents, the people held promises in high regard. In addition, Canghai owed Fu Clan a debt he could never repay. However, why was it that Canghai had said that it was fine so long as he didn’t kill that young man? Canghai did not seem like a heartless man.</p>
 <p>“Fu Long was originally a smart and handsome child from a young age, and our families would meet once every three years. Even if when he grew up, I still had a favorable impression of him. However, the reason I had agreed for both of you to put up an act in front of them and allowed Qing Shui to do as he wish so long as Fu Long was not killed, is because I saw him rape and kill a commoner lady and then killed her whole family for myself . At that time, I wanted very much to kill that beast, but I had a debt to Fu Clan which I could never return, and thus I couldn’t.” Canghai squinted his eyes, as if he was recalling his memories.</p>
 <p>“Beast, he’s better off dead!” Canghai Mingyue said furiously.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, rest assured, I will not let him do as he wishes with you. When we got you into this, we didn’t think that things would turn out this way.” Canghai didn’t expect Qing Shui to cripple Fu Long, and with just one move. But that kick was really like a Flood Dragon emerging from the seas, so it wasn’t tough to defeat an 8th grade Xiantian expert who was caught unaware. Moreover, the Dan Tian was a warrior’s weakest point. If that kick was at full force, it could kill.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that the Tiger Tailwhip Kick had such an impact partly because he had reached the small success stage for the Crane Form. If he had not reached this level for the Crane Form, it was be very likely that the other party could avoid having his Dan Tian attack or even dodged his attack completely.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled awkwardly, “Senior, I’ve caused you some trouble!”</p>
 <p>“No, to be honest, I’m especially satisfied with this outcome. It was just that I feel pity for Fu Xing. He is an upright person, but to think that he has such a beast for a son.” Canghai replied in a casual tone.</p>
 <p>“Senior, how is Fu Clan’s abilities? Is Fu Xing the strongest?” Qing Shui gave it some thought before he asked Canghai.</p>
 <p>“There aren’t many people in Fu Clan, and Fu Xing is the strongest amongst them. Mmm, Fu Clan’s leader is the person in charged on Fu Jian Country.”</p>
 <p>Another head of a country, and he was a low grade Martial King expert at that. It seemed like Cang Lang Country really was the weakest in the Greencloud Continent. This made Qing Shui recall that Yang Jiang Country’s Yan City was one of the best, and he felt that the weight he was carrying on his shoulders was very heavy.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li remained silent all this time, but she had been looking at Qing Shui worriedly. She did not know when she had start feeling worried and anxious for a guy.</p>
 <p>She herself did not really understand the relationship between herself and Qing Shui, and didn't have the courage to ask him. Most importantly, she was still not sure if she was in love with him.</p>
 <p>More often than not, she had only enjoyed to silently stand beside him, and accompany him!</p>
 <p>When they headed back, Qing Shui noticed that Canghai Mingyue’s gaze towards him was still one of evasion. He knew that his words today had offended this Young Miss. However, he was still very happy and satisfied. But, he seemed to have forgotten Huoyun Liu-Li would look towards him occasionally.</p>
