 <p>AST 1226 - Spring of Life, Golden Body at Great Perfection Stage, Refine</p>
 <p>The time ratio within the realm stayed the same. However, Qing Shui was already really satisfied with the result. Even though strong warriors required to spend a lot of time cultivating, time alone wasn’t the only factor in getting stronger. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been sayings such as “an unusual genius that comes down from heaven”. Besides, Qing Shui already had an absolute advantage in terms of time.</p>
 <p>In his previous life, there was a saying, “Success is 99% effort and 1% talent. Without considering the truth of this statement and assuming that it is true, the main point was the 1% talent. It was definitely more important than the 99% effort. In his previous life, the purpose of this saying was to motivate people, telling them they would succeed as long as they put in effort.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui shifted his sight away from the stone tablet and looked towards the lake-sized pond. The water was so clear that one could see the bottom of it. Seeing that the pond was about a hundred meters deep, Qing Shui felt really secured and satisfied. Everthing in it belonged to him alone.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the pair of Longevity fish he caught when he was in Southern Sea. Currently, there were already more than ten smaller Longevity fish following behind them. They were happily swimming inside the pond at the moment. Their agile bodies could aid them in avoiding dangers.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui also saw the Immortal Fish and Four-Tailed Mud Fish. However, there were still very few of them. Other than being extreme delicacies, they could also help in cultivation and strengthening the consumer’s body. It even helped slightly increase the consumer’s Innate Skills as well as helped them cleanse their bone marrow.</p>
 <p>It was the marvelous nature which enabled a lot of these weird things to be born. All of these were the results of absorbing the spiritual qi of heaven and earth. The majority of people might not even get to see these things once throughout their entire life.</p>
 <p>Other than these two species, there were also a few others within the pond. But for now, Qing Shui didn’t touch them because there were very few of them. For now, he should raise them first. This process shouldn’t take long within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui may have a limitation in time within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal but that didn’t apply to the things living here. Hence, one day spent by Qing Shui in the outside world was equivalent to the medicinal herbs as well as fish species staying in the realm for four hundred days. Furthermore, Qing Shui could only stay here for up to six hours. They on the other hand, could stay the full 24 hours. The difference was just too large.</p>
 <p>Ancient Demonic Fruit Tree!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw the Ancient Demonic Fruit Tree which was by the pond. It was the height of two men together. However, it was as thick as a person. It seemed strong and tough and felt bursting with vitality. This tree was greenish grey in color. There was a layer of thick bark on the outside, preventing any swords from cutting through it. There were around ten fruits which looked like peaches on it, except they looked sparkling and translucent with not even the slightest flaw. In fact, they looked even more like works of art.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui plucked all of the Ancient Demonic Fruit and carefully put it away. For now, he didn’t dare to let the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant consume it. He wanted to refine the strength as early as possible. If not, he wouldn’t dare to let the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant break through once again.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had no idea what the Ancient Demonic Fruit was used for. For now, he would just put it aside first as he had other things that he needed to look at.</p>
 <p>Spring of Life!</p>
 <p>At the moment when Qing Shui saw the so called Spring of Life, he felt a bit speechless. The reason being that the Spring of Life was located at a spot on top of a jade stone-like platform that was about half the height of a man. The stone platform was just like the wells from ancient times, it was a few meters in size and looked white like jade, there was even a faint white light emitted from it. The Spring of Life on the other hand, was about the size of the mouth of a bowl. It was one foot deep. There was a white qi being emitted from it. Its formidable life force and spiritual qi was very stunning. They were all gathered around the mouth of the Spring of Life.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked inside. The spring became smaller as it went deeper. By the time it reached the bottom, it was only the size of a wine cup. There was some very shallow sparkling jade liquid. It looked clear and brilliant and seemed to be more concentrated than water. Even though he had never seen bejeweled nectar but he felt that this liquid-like substance was precisely it. Actually, Qing Shui had also seen other forms of “bejeweled nectar”. It was said that one would be able to taste it through kissing.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Vision Technique!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the Spring of Life with his Heavenly Vision Technique.</p>
 <p>Spring of Life. A spiritual spring of Heaven and Earth. It was formed as a result of spiritual qi gathering together. Only one drop would be produced per year. It could help increase one’s strength and increase their lifespan. It could help cure a hundred kinds of diseases as well as help strengthen one’s body. It increased one’s hidden potential and could be used to aid in refining medicines as well as demons……. The degree of increase varied between people.</p>
 <p>“Such a good item! To think such a heaven-defying substance exists.” At this moment, Qing Shui was so happy that he was unable to put it into words. But it took one year for a drop to be produced. Without the realm, he would only be able to get a hundred drops in a hundred years. How much was a hundred drops? Even a large mouthful of water would be more than that.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui tried using his hands to condense the spiritual qi. Very quickly, Qing Shui already managed to take out a drop of Spring of Life. It was the size of a yellow bean. Its body was surrounded by a layer of faint spiritual qi which resembled white mist.</p>
 <p>After hesitating for a while, Qing Shui immediately opened his mouth and absorbed the Spring of Life. It tasted sweet and refreshing. It also had a faint sweet smell. As soon as it entered his mouth, it immediately melted and spread out towards his limbs and bones instead of merely getting swallowed down into his stomach.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui closed his eyes as he felt the changes within his body. That was a very subtle feeling. It’s just like a layer of sand, where the original hideous marks on it were currently being wiped softly by one’s hand, causing the layer of sand to look untouched.</p>
 <p>The fastest ability of the Spring of Life was its ability to regenerate one’s body. For every cultivator, their bodies were bound to have some unmentioned diseases, for example their injuries. Even though they recovered, a few scars were still bound to be left behind. It might look like a small issue but it was precisely these small issues that would cause someone to reach a bottleneck in the future and no longer be able to break through. It might even cause their vitality to be in turmoil.</p>
 <p>Every warrior was bound to receive injuries. Qing Shui was already hiding a lot of secrets within his body. Furthermore, he was confident in his medical expertise and other skills. The thing he was the proudest of was his body’s ability to self-recover. Previously, he had a feeling that the Spring of Life had helped him significantly change himself. Most parts of his body had already recovered. His organs as well as his bones also got a huge upgrade and became perfect again.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life had no limit. But there was no use taking a lot of it in within a short period of time. Hence, one drop would basically be enough for each person. It could be used to treat illnesses as well as strengthen one’s bones and veins.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui licked his lips and felt that he was unable to fully express himself. He just remembered that his Nine Yang Golden Body was already at Great Perfection Stage. The Spring of Life from before, on the other hand, had also helped provide a tremendous boost to the strength of his body.</p>
 <p>The Spring of Life could also be used to stabilize one’s strength and help find balance within one’s body. As Qing Shui sensed it, he smiled. All of these sudden changes as well as the Spring of Life had made his physical strength reach a hundred nimbus.</p>
 <p>A hundred nimbus and the Nine Yang Golden Body at its Great Perfection Stage…… Qing Shui felt that his body had reached a height like never before. He felt that he was now able to refine that strength. Prior to this, he was afraid that his body would explode. But now, his Nine Yang Golden Body was already at its Great Perfection Stage, his physical strength had also been significantly increased. The energy from Spring of Life was now within his body and most importantly, his spirit energy also received a tremendous boost. He felt that if he didn’t refine it today, there wouldn’t be as many opportunities to do so in the future.</p>
 <p>All of this happened thanks to the Ninth Heavenly Golden Pellet given to him by Tian Jiange. He didn’t know if this was considered good karma which he planted. It was just that the “fruit of karma” came so soon. No matter what, everything was already considered to be really, extremely worthwhile.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui clenched his teeth and decided to refine it. He restored his body to its peak. After that, he sat down cross-legged near the Bodhi Tree beside the Spring of Life.</p>
 <p>He slowly revolved his qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique. The Ancient Strengthening Technique revolved cycle by cycle. After it had revolved a number of times and carried an enormous amount of both the Violet Gold Divine Force and Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique, they rushed together towards that formidable energy.</p>
 <p>Hong!</p>
 <p>That grey colored pellet burst open in just a short while. An enormous energy that almost made Qing Shui collapse surged through his body. Qing Shui’s body was just like a balloon which suddenly got inflated.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really focused as he swiftly revolved his Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation. The Yin-Yang Image also began revolving at great speed. However, his body was still expanding whereas the internal part of his body was being compressed. At the moment when he felt like his body was about to explode, a indescribable refreshing feeling spread through his body. It was as if the toughness of his body was increased a number times. It helped temporarily remove him from the danger of having his body explode.</p>
 <p>Spring of Life!</p>
 <p>This was the power of the Spring of Life. Both his organs and bones were also being compressed. Luckily, his Nine Yang Golden Body was at its Large Success Stage. Otherwise, his bones would have most likely been crushed. His organs would have also burst from being squished.</p>
 <p>The energy within Qing Shui’s body was still increasing. Of course, he was also madly operating and refining the energy. This looked just like a person who was about to starve to death madly gulping delicious food. Qing Shui knew that he would only be able to live if he absorbed it quickly.</p>
 <p>Absorb and refine!</p>
 <p>The golden pellet within his Dantian was revolving very rapidly as it continuously refined and absorbed the tyrannical energy.</p>
 <p>But very quickly, Qing Shui realized that he was near his limit yet again !</p>
 <p>However, he currently had no other choice but to absorb as much as he could. It felt just like when a person was full but still had to gobble their food.</p>
 <p>It was a very unpleasant feeling!</p>
 <p>Veined patterns which resembled spiderwebs had already started appearing across Qing Shui’s body. They were all bloody red in color. In just a short while, dark red liquid could already be seen coming out. In an instant, he got dyed into a red man.</p>
 <p>“Is my body really going to explode?” Qing Shui felt really distressed. If his body was to really explode, he would definitely die. Even if he had medicines like Bones of the Living Dead, it would still be useless. The reason being that his physical body would disappear right away as a result of the explosion.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little. At the moment when Qing Shui felt that he was no longer able to hold on, a powerful energy burst out from deep within his body.</p>
 <p>Force of Rebirth!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui who experienced the Force of Rebirth looked as if he got his entire life force renewed once again, madly absorbing the energy within his body.</p>
 <p>After repeating it a few times, his body eventually reached a saturated state. Qing Shui was considered to have been out of danger. But still, he didn’t manage to absorb all of it within such a short period of time. The only thing he could do was to digest as much of the strength he absorbed as he could.</p>
 <p>Time went on little by little. After Qing Shui digested a bit, he would proceed to refine more. This process lasted for around three months. In his last two days, Qing Shui opened both of his eyes. Both of his eyes looked really bright and solid. But very quickly, they went back to normal. Qing Shui let out a long breath expelling the turbid gas within his body.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smelled a bloody smell. As he looked down, he realized that the blood scabs on his body were already about an inch thick. It was black in color. Not only did it have strong bloody smell, there was also a fishy smell to it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui quickly changed his clothes and took a bath. He immediately burned the clothes from before. Qing Shui felt a little depressed as he looked at his skin. It was almost comparable to that of women’s.</p>
 <p>Luckily, he had muscles. Even though they weren’t ridiculously huge, they were defined. Qing Shui actually didn’t like it for men to have such good skin and felt that it was better if it was rough.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt as if he was in a dream, sensing the surging energy within his body.</p>
 <p>With excitement in his heart, Qing Shui proceeded to sense his current strength. Even though he wasn’t certain of his own strength at the moment, he was sure that it had skyrocketed.</p>
