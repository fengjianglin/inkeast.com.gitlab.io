 <p><strong>AST 1218 - The Prescription for Violet Golden Bloodline? The Eldest Princess broke through</strong></p>
 <p>“I never thought that you would be an alchemist as well. I thought refining demons was your expertise. These Ten Thousand Years Spiritual Limestones are already considered to be decent. It seems that you should be very strong in terms of refining medicines.” The Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui mischievously. She seemed like she had seen through something.</p>
 <p>It was as he thought, the Eldest Princess had found out everything, it was just that she didn’t question him about it. She knew that there were some things that shouldn’t be asked randomly. If the person didn’t want to talk about it, it was no use even if she asked.</p>
 <p>“I guess so, it’s just that I lacked the prescription for it. As long as I have the ingredients listed on the prescription as well as the prescription itself, I would basically be able to make them.” Qing Shui wasn’t over exaggerating. He was really capable of that. Added on that there were quite a few Golden Snake Grass within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, the success rate was basically not a problem.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you sure?”the Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>“Of course, it shouldn’t be a problem. Could it be that there is something the Eldest Princess would like me to help make?” Qing Shui asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“There really is one. I wonder if you can help me with it? I have the prescription as well as the materials for it. Unfortunately, I only have one for myself. But all of the alchemists whom I found would only tell me that their chance of success was less than 10%. Hence, I have never dared to try it. I fear failure, once it failed, it would really hit me hard. 10% success rate is certainly too low,” the Eldest Princess said while letting out a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Can I have a look at your prescription? Only after looking at it will I be able to give you a definite answer,” Qing Shui said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” As the Eldest Princess spoke, she took out a violet gold colored Beast Parchment. As she took it out, a powerful spiritual qi fluctuation was emitting from it. Merely from the fact that the prescriptions were recorded on the beast parchment, he could already tell that this prescription was extraordinary.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui took it, a thread of refreshing aura entered his body through the meridians in his fingers. It was a really bizarre sensation. After that, Qing Shui realized that the blood within his Violet Gold Bloodline seemed to have gotten slightly thicker.</p>
 <p>This was just too bizarre…… Merely the spiritual qi from a beast parchment was capable of making the Violet Gold Bloodline within him thicker……. It could be seen just how precious this beast parchment was. But Qing Shui knew that the prescription written on it was even more precious.</p>
 <p>The prescription for Violet Gold Bloodline!</p>
 <p>Those few simple words stunned Qing Shui. Qing Shui remembered his own Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl. Those were things left behind from ancient times. He didn’t know if he would end up with the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl precisely once he refined this prescription. Or could it be something else? Could it make all the blood within one’s body turn Violet Gold Blood at once?</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Qing Shui shook his head. It wouldn’t be that tyrannically as no one would dare to take it if that was the case. Could it be that the purity of the Violet Gold Bloodline was different?</p>
 <p>As of now, Qing Shui’s Violet Gold Bloodline was already as thick as knitting wool. It was violet gold in color. At the start, it wasn’t as powerful as now. This was also due to his physical body getting stronger later on. Previously, it only started off with a drop of Violet Gold Blood. That was just like a seed. Slowly, it multiplied and formed a line. Eventually, the head and tail of the line even connected and formed a cycle.</p>
 <p>Could this Violet Gold Bloodline Prescription be Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl?</p>
 <p>After thinking for a while, Qing Shui felt a bit muddled. He should take a look at the ingredients listed first. This way, he would be able to find out about the function of the Violet Gold Bloodline Prescription.</p>
 <p>Recipe: Violet Gold Emperor Grass, Three Leaves Sky Lotus, Ginseng which is above eight thousand years, Fleeceflower Root that is above eight thousand years, Lingzhi that is above eight thousand years, Grade Four Demon Nucleus, Grade Four demonic beast’s core…...</p>
 <p>Effect: Plant a Violet Gold Bloodline within the consumer’s blood, letting the blood form a Violet Gold Bloodline within three years. It could also make the Violet Gold Bloodlines of people who originally already have them even more pure.</p>
 <p>One could only take it once every ten years and ten times in one’s lifetime!</p>
 <p>Reading to this point, Qing Shui had already understood that actually, this thing was almost the same as the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl. It was just that this one could also be used to increase the quality of the Violet Gold Bloodline, further strengthening the energy hidden within said bloodline. However, it was very likely that the effect wouldn’t be as powerful as the pearl upon the first time taking it.</p>
 <p>This was definitely a good thing. Even though Qing Shui had the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl, it was something he gained without any effort. He would never be able to feel the excitement of someone who got the prescription for Violet Gold Bloodline Prescription.</p>
 <p>A lot of people across the continents yearned for Gold Bloodline and Violet Gold Bloodline. There was also those who yearned for Silver Bloodline. These people’s blood natures had different qualities as well as achievements. As long as they had good bloodlines, despite cultivating just like how normal people did, their achievements would be ten times or even unmeasurably greater compared to those of ordinary people.</p>
 <p>After looking through all of it, Qing Shui lifted his head and smiled, “I am hundred percent sure I can refine this.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought over it. Even if he failed, he still had the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl.</p>
 <p>He suddenly thought about Yan Jinyu and felt the need to give her one. Hence, he felt that there was no need for him to hide it from the Eldest Princess. He once again asked, “I have something with me which is similar to transforming the nature of one’s blood. I wonder if the Eldest Princess has seen through it?”</p>
 <p>“You have Violet Gold Bloodline?” The Eldest Princess looked a bit shocked when she stared at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“There is only a strand of violet gold blood within my body currently. How about this? Since you have helped me quite a lot, why don’t you take the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl which I have first? After I refine the medicinal pill for you a bit later, we will try to catalyse the process. Will that be better?” Qing Shui still said it. He could feel that this woman was really honest. She was a friend worth making.</p>
 <p>“You are more and more mysterious now. Why don’t you tell me more about your secrets? I am feeling more and more curious.” The Eldest Princess smiled.</p>
 <p>That smile of hers was enough to topple cities and countries.</p>
 <p>“Eldest Princess, don’t you know that a woman cannot feel this much curiosity towards a man? This will cause you to lose yourself,” Qing Shui said in a flirtish tone.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, in my eyes, you are a mysterious little brat,” the Eldest Princess said something which made Qing Shui felt particularly upset. Nevertheless, he didn’t take it to heart.</p>
 <p>He took out a Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl and passed it to her, “This is a Violet Gold Divine Pearl. I got a few of them by accident. It can help plant a drop of Violet Gold Blood within your body. With time and your cultivation, it will slowly multiply. Following its increase in number, it will help make the strength within your blood to become stronger. Slowly, it will make the Violet Gold Blood take control of your blood and make your blood filled with violet blood force.”</p>
 <p>“Well, thank you then. Actually, the best ending I thought about regarding this prescription is this one. I never thought that I would be able to realize it so soon. Will you mind if I take it?”The Eldest Princess took over the porcelain bottle which Qing Shui handed over.</p>
 <p>“Let me act as your protector.” Qing Shui felt that he was qualified to say this now. He summoned the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant as well.</p>
 <p>The Eldest Princess smiled and nodded. After that, she opened the porcelain bottle and swallowed the Violet Gold Bloodline Pearl within.</p>
 <p>Do not look down on a drop of Violet Gold Blood. Even one small drop of it was already an enormous power. This was just a seed. In the future, it was something which could end up as a tall, huge tree. A violet light started surrounding the Eldest Princess’ body. An enormous aura arose, releasing a violet qi which circled around her, adding a kind of divine and enchanting feeling to her already goddess-like beauty.</p>
 <p>What happened after was what shocked Qing Shui even more. The Eldest Princess’ body suddenly shone with an abundant white halo and enveloped her within it. It was like an enormous cocoon. After that, an enormous white sword qi rushed out of her body and went straight up into the sky.</p>
 <p>Luckily, this tyrannical aura didn’t spread into the surroundings. It was only penetrating through the air. It looked just like it was trying to pierce through the sky.</p>
 <p>She broke through!</p>
 <p>However, the surroundings were still really quiet. It seemed like this kind of movement didn’t attract anyone’s attention. Luckily, the entire process didn’t take long. The light dissipated and the Eldest Princess’ body started looking more distinct. Her face carried a kind of aura which resembled that of an illusion as well as that of a fairy. That feeling was really weird. It felt as if she had became a fairy herself.</p>
 <p>There was a faint smile on her face, but at the same time that also seemed to not be the case. As she looked at Qing Shui her sexy lips slightly curved up and she smiled. Qing Shui on the other hand, was truly stunned this time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s mind turned blank watching her smile. However, both of his eyes still looked tranquil. That was a kind of admiration for beauty. By the time he came back to his senses, he felt a bit embarrassed, “You look as beautiful as a fairy. Your beauty is peerless.”</p>
 <p>“I am already happy enough being able to hear your compliments. Thank you! I have broken through.” The Eldest Princess extended her hand and took out an Interspatial Silk Sachet for Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“I am going to give you the medicines and prescriptions here. There is no use in me keeping them.”</p>
 <p>“I will take all of them then. Oh and congratulations for breaking through,” Said Qing Shui as he received it. Actually, it didn’t really matter whether he wanted these prescriptions. He had already memorized them. If he rejected them, it would look like he was avoiding them. Also, the Eldest Princess was already satisfied after gaining her own benefits. Most importantly, he was unable to find sufficient materials for now. Hence, the prescription was basically useless at the moment. However, he could still refine it one more time. He wasn’t sure how many he could refine from it.</p>
 <p>“In any case, we are considered friends. You don’t have to be so formal. Oh yeah, I have already heard news about your wife. She is now confirmed to be in Divine Might Dynasty. But she doesn’t belong to the dynasty itself. She is in the Holy Maiden of Lotus Sect,” the Eldest Princess told Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Lotus Sect?” Qing Shui felt really suspicious. He knew that Di Chen was a member of Lotus Realm back when she was in the five continents. It was because she absorbed the Sacred Object Lotus Platform which caused her to become too strong and caused her to instantly see through the world of mortals. All of this was mainly because the changes were too significant. It was just like when a normal person immediately got promoted to be the king of a dynasty. All of this happened so suddenly that for a moment, he was unable to digest it.</p>
 <p>“Lotus Sect is very strong. The sect is located in Divine Might Dynasty. Legend has it that it is a Peak Grade Three Sect. But there are more legends which say that Lotus Sect’s true strength is even beyond that of Divine Might Dynasty. We don’t know if it is real for now. But Lotus Sect holds an extraordinarily high position in Divine Might Dynasty. Normally, the sect won’t volunteer to take part in battles. Furthermore, they walk across the continents to do charity work. Hence, there are a lot of people who support them.”</p>
 <p>Speaking up to this point, the Eldest Princess looked at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>But all of these seemed really odd in Qing Shui’s eyes. Could Lotus Sect be a match against Grade Four Dynasties? Could it possibly match up against Heaven Secrets Academy? Were there really only three organizations with fourth grade strength in Western Oxhe Continent?</p>
 <p>Previously, he had also heard about it. This was just on the surface. Besides, the Heaven Secrets Academy, Divine Might Dynasty and the other Grade Four Dynasties were forces from many years ago. No one was certain of whether they were still Grade Four Dynasties.</p>
 <p>Were there still more fourth grade forces hidden below the Western Oxhe Continent? Besides, the three fourth grade forces together also covered only half of the area of Western Oxhe Continent. No one would be able to be certain what was hidden within such a huge continent.</p>
 <p>For now, he should continue to make himself stronger. Only when he became stronger would he be able to meet Di Chen once again. If not, even if he were to go there, it would also most likely be hopeless. Qing Shui hoped that he would be able to help her find things and people which she cared about. He also hoped that she would be able to once again fall in love with him.</p>
 <p>He didn’t plan to use the two Heartmatched Fruit within the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Maybe after using it, he would be able to make Di Chen come back to his side. But his subconscious mind didn’t really favour that idea. Unless he was really left with no choice, he would definitely not use the Heartmatched Fruit.</p>
