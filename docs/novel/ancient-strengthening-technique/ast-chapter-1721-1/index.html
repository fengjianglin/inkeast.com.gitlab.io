 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Qing Shui was also getting more and more curious. He had heard rumors saying that the person who wanted to marry Qing Hanye was the Cave Lord of Watermoon Cavern. Though the cavern lord himself might not be the strongest, there was no doubt that he would possess the mightiest force behind his back. In this world, everything was decided by strength. It would be impossible for him to take up such a position without possessing a worthwhile strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the way things seemed, there was a high possibility that the Watermoon Cavern Lord had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While pondering over all of these, Qing Shui slowly walked beside Qing Hanye towards the main hall of Dragonwolf Palace. Along the way, he saw a lot of people greeting Qing Hanye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he arrived at the main hall, Qing Shui could already feel a few powerful aurae oozing out of it. Other than the four guards from Dragonwolf Palace, there were four other guards that weren’t from the palace. They should be people from Watermoon Cavern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Palace Lord!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four guards from Dragonwolf Palace politely bowed before Qing Hanye. In response, Qing Hanye nodded her head. She then brought Qing Shui along to the main hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mister, please hold your step. The cavern lord has specifically told us that no one other than the Palace Lord was allowed in.” A guard from Watermoon Cavern came out and stopped Qing Shui. He seemed a bit arrogant and had a smile which looked as if he was taking joy in other people’s misfortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was stunned but quickly recovered after a few moments of thought. He figured that this was one of the scenarios that could happen. Since people from Watermoon Cavern had come, it just came to say that they understood the situations here quite well. They should have been made aware of his presence as well. Without the instruction from the cavern lord, it was unlikely that the guard would have the guts to do something like that. Not to mention that he had already emphasized before that the cavern lord informed him that other than Qing Hanye, no one was allowed inside the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Dragonwolf Palace, not the Watermoon Cavern. The things which Watermoon Cavern was doing now has indicated that they had always ignored the standing of the Dragonwolf Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Qing Shui could do anything, Qing Hanye had already landed her palm on the guard’s face. The guard immediately got blown to the side and spurted out fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Dragonwolf Palace. You have no right to order around here.” Qing Hanye shot a cold stare at the remaining guards of Watermoon Cavern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ye`Er, you are back! Come here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, an old man’s voice was heard coming from inside the main hall. The old man sounded really friendly. He was obviously saying that with a genuine smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye shouted out in joy. She grabbed Qing Shui’s hand and walked into the hall together with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep down, Qing Shui was really happy when Qing Hanye held his hand. Their relationship hadn’t seen much improvement for the past two months. But now, things had once again become uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as they got in, Qing Shui could already see the old man sitting on top. Opposite the old man was a man with a middle-aged look. Though he was sitting down, Qing Shui could tell that he has a slender figure. An elegant aura could be felt emitting out of his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was very handsome. He had a bright and noble look. His nose was straight and upright. The deep emotions in his eyes gave people the impression that he was a mature man. On his face was a smile that looked friendly but also was enough to warn people not to get close to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man didn’t bother standing up when Qing Shui and Qing Hanye made their entrance. In fact, he didn’t even bother looking at Qing Shui. He only shot a gaze at Qing Hanye. But the moment he saw them holding hands, he couldn’t help but slightly move his brows. However, it only lasted momentarily before he managed to swiftly return back to his usual look. In his thought, he would just chop off whichever hand that had interacted with Qing Hanye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Qing Shui didn’t know what the man was thinking. Behind the man stood five other people. They all looked a bit old, or rather, middle-aged. At this moment, they were probing Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ye`Er, come here. This is the Watermoon Cavern Lord, Mister Chi Yan.” The old man was smiling when he introduced the Cave Lord to Qing Hanye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, even Qing Shui himself was unable to tell what exactly the old man was thinking. It made Qing Shui began to suspect that this marriage was rushed by the old man himself. If it wasn’t for the Extreme Yang Righteous Pill which the old man had given to Qing Shui while telling him that to take good care of Qing Hanye, he would have totally been convinced by it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, because of that, Qing Shui still believed that the old man wasn’t the person responsible for pushing the marriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Getting somebody else to do the dirty work’!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, this phrase appeared in Qing Shui’s mind. But very quickly, he dismissed this idea. For now, he felt that he was being a little too paranoid. He thought that it would be best if he stopped suspecting the old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you, Mister Chi Yan!” Qing Hanye greeted him in an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ye`Er, you are really beautiful. You are looking better day by day.” The man flattered with a smile. The same moment, he moved his gaze to Qing Shui. Both of the man’s eyes looked really bright. Qing Shui felt as if he was looking at a bottomless pond and was about to get sucked into a current.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was amazed. He had never expected for the man to cultivate such an alluring mind trick. If it wasn’t for his powerful Spirit Energy and his ability to neglect up to 70% of Spiritual Energy Attacks, Qing Shui would have fallen into his trap. The reason being that this kind of alluring mind trick was also considered to be Spiritual Energy Attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was shocked when he noticed Qing Shui avoiding his attacks. He instinctively started to look at the young man seriously. The young man was very handsome. He also carried a unique charisma. Initially, he thought that he was just a plain pretty boy, but now, he realized that he had totally misjudged him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as he thought deeper, he realized that it made sense. It was impossible for a person like Qing Hanye to date a simple pretty boy. Initially, he assumed that she was looking for a mere duplicate to negotiate conditions with them. But now, he had realized that things seemed to be a bit more complex than this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qing Hanye’s master broke the silence and began talking to Chi Yan, “This is Qing Shui, Ye`Er’s friend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man picked just the right time to say this. Deep down, Chi Yan was feeling quite upset. Friends? They must have been very close friends then, to the extent that they could hold hands with each other. He then proceeded to look at Qing Shui calmly, “Please kindly take your hands off of my fianceé. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that your hand will still be attached to your arm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Yan smiled and stared at Qing Shui. He looked very calm. No one was able to tell that he was actually in rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fianceé? What’s the difference between your age and Ye`Er’s age?” Qing Shui asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
