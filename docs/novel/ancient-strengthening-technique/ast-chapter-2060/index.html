 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flower ocean!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui and Shen Huang only managed to find the flower ocean after searching for about half a day. This was still under the circumstances when he had the Nine Continents Step in use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had the Five Elements Divine Flag and the Nine Continents Step. Thanks to them, he managed to accomplish something which could only be done in a month within two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He observed the boundless flower ocean that was currently in front of him. There were a lot of flowers and trees among them. Some of them were also very tall. This place was abundant with flowers’ aroma. It was a piece of colorful land and many butterflies, birds, hummingbirds, and even demonic beasts in the form of flowers could be seen in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could see a lot of bees that were at least the size of a small cow. It was not unusual for the bees and butterflies in this world to grow to this size. Qing Shui also saw a lot of moths that were fiery red in color, but those weren’t the Blaze Moth. The most unique feature about the Blaze Moth was its body that was burning with fire. That was the fire from its core. Just like a passive battle technique, it didn’t consume any of its energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than that, the Blaze Moth was supposed to be huge, at least the size of a small mountain top. Thus, it would be quite easy to recognize it. However, it was impossible for there to be a Blaze Moth in this place. The flowers and trees here couldn’t withstand the flame on the Blaze Moth’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Huang blushed as she once again put her arms around Qing Shui’s neck. Her body had started trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui quickly embraced her. As he looked at her pale face which had a bit of redness on it, he warmed her up with his body. He was the only person who could do that. If it had been someone else, she would have frozen into an ice sculpture.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This had happened quite a few times throughout the entire journey. Even though Qing Shui had told her that she could hug him whenever she was feeling cold, she would wait until the moment when she was no longer able to hold it to do so. Slowly, she had gotten used to it and had also familiarized herself with the movements of hugging Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Usually, Qing Shui would have to hug her for about an hour to temporarily clear away the cold poisons across her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were standing at the border of the ocean of flowers as they quietly embraced each other. From outsider’s perspectives, they were like a couple who loved each other and were admired by a lot of people. For the time being, Qing Shui had a soft and tender body in his arms. He was able to feel the exquisite and bulging parts of her body clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the beginning, since her body was freezing cold, Qing Shui wouldn’t think too much about it. However, after a while, Shen Huang’s body would start to warm up, and after that, a refreshing feeling would pass into his body which made him comfortable. Towards the end, her body would become so warm to the point it felt like a warm jade. Without realizing it, his body had begun reacting to hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that?” Shen Huang felt that there seemed to be something pushing against her tummy. She then extended her hand to touch it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she extended her hand, Qing Shui took a deep breath. It seemed he might have been touched by her in that part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that? It seems to know how to jump.” The thing which she was grabbing felt very hot. But for the time being, she would very much appreciate a bit of hotness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Nine Yang Root of the Nine Yang Body. Thus, it would naturally be hot. Particularly to Shen Huang who had been inflicted with the Black Ice Poison, and whose symptoms were breaking out, grabbing this thing could help temporarily clear her poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she looked down and saw what she was holding, she became stunned and abruptly let go of it. Her face looked even redder than the sun. For a moment, she didn’t know what to do except stand in front of Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Erm… I don’t mean to harass you or anything… It just so happened to be my body’s instinct… I also never thought that things would turn out like this. Before I manage to move away from you, you are already holding it….” Qing Shui said awkwardly. At the moment, that thing was still standing proudly. It pushed his cloth up and made it seem like a tent that had been set up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You bastard… Stop it…..” At the moment, Shen Huang was feeling very embarrassed. If there was a hole beside her, she would have drilled her head and buried herself into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go in there!” Qing Shui could tell that Shen Huang was feeling very confused and automatically knew that it was time for him to change the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Qing Shui took the lead and entered the place. He went into the boundless ocean of flowers. Maybe because they were at the border, there were a lot of paths connecting to the deeper parts of the area. Thus, they were able to move forward by following the path. Shen Huang was behind Qing Shui. As she looked at the man in front of her, for a moment, she found herself at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, she had never lost her composure even when being hugged by Qing Shui. But now, for the first time, she was starting to feel a bit at a loss. She felt that her heart, which had often stood still and tall, might have begun falling for him. This kind of feeling couldn’t be described in words. Basically, she wasn’t able to calm her mind like she used to. In the past, it was easy for her to clear up her mind. Furthermore, there also wouldn't be a lot of fluctuations in her heart, making it very easy for her to control her emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, she would start paying attention to this man from time to time. Occasionally, she would think about the things which she had experienced with him. She knew that this wasn’t a good situation as it could hinder her cultivations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were some situations which couldn’t be controlled. Otherwise, her heart wouldn’t have trembled from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could sense when Shen Huang was looking at him from behind. Furthermore, she had her eyes fixed on him for quite some time. He then turned around a bit confused, and it just so happened that their eyes met at the same time. Shen Huang got so nervous that she immediately looked the other way and blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Qing Shui’s heart to tremble. In the past, this woman wouldn’t act like this. There was no way she would reveal an expression like that nor tried to avoid contact with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest Mistress, let me tell you about a joke.” Qing Shui grabbed her hand and continued moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure!” Shen Huang nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There was once a man who liked a woman a lot, but he never dared to tell her about it. Soon, the woman got married and had her own children. One day, the man came across the woman again and at that time, she happened to be breastfeeding her babies. The man then walked up to her and pressed her breasts with both of his hands. He then said to the baby, ‘Say “uncle”. If you don’t, you won’t get to drink the milk.’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it not funny? Alright then, let me tell you another one. This will definitely make you laugh.” Qing Shui noticed that Shen Huang didn’t smile, but she also didn’t seem to feel unhappy about it. Thus, he continued on saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not say anything that’s too vulgar.” Shen Huang said quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui started frowning and looked worried, “If even this is considered vulgar to you, you are just going to end up making things difficult for me. Let's see... Ah! I got it! This will definitely make you laugh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There was a snail and a turtle who once lived together in the same house. One day, the snail accidentally cut open a wound on itself and started bleeding heavily. Thus, it quickly went to the turtle and then it told the turtle to look for a physician as soon as possible. The turtle left, but it didn’t return even after half a day had passed. Thus, the snail was no longer able to hold any longer and yelled, ‘For fuck sake, if you don’t come back now! I am going to bleed to death!’ Soon, the voice of the turtle came through from outside, ‘Damn it, can’t you see me running? If you continue to yell at me like that, I will just come back in and stay home.’”</span></p>

Why would I want to rob you?” She knew what Qing Shui meant by her robbing him; she could sense Qing Shui’s thoughts. It was the first time she hated the ability which enabled her to read the minds of other people.</span></p>
