 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange fully recovered in just three days. The constitutions of the women in the Portraits of Beauty were generally strong. Their powers were considered phenomenal too. Even so, she never went out of the small courtyard during her full recuperation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Yiye Jiange had recovered, Qing Hanye went back to Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace, as she still had a bunch of things awaiting her to settle. She would still be very busy considering that she had to handle such a hefty power. There weren’t any big problems. Smaller problems, however, kept pouring in endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui decided to send her back to the palace. Both of them did not say a word during their journey, causing the atmosphere between them to become slightly awkward. Qing Hanye behaved naturally, yet she would turn her gaze to Qing Shui at times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had met each other several times before. During their last meeting, they had a lot to talk about. As time went by, they were able to relive the scenario between the two of them, little by little. Unfortunately, besides the charming dream from before, there was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Don’t you have anything to say after seeing me?” Qing Hanye stopped and glared at Qing Shui. She was calm, yet with her natural femininity and overall charm, her presence was a huge seduction even just standing there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t feel like talking when I see you. I fear something will happen even by looking at you.” Qing Shui smiled. He didn’t like this kind of atmosphere, which was why he had hoped to use this sort of method to liven up the atmosphere,even by a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Something did happen between us a long time ago.” Qing Hanye did not smile, but she wasn’t angry either. Even though she did not smile, there seemed to be a radiance of a smile beneath her expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When was that?” Qing Shui asked, rhetorically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, stop acting confused. I won’t force you or anything. You can’t possibly be that scared, right? Don’t tell me you are feeling guilty... are you?” Qing Hanye took two steps forward and stopped in front of Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distance between them was just less than half a foot away. The smell of her exquisite fragrance thrilled his nostrils. Most importantly, Qing Hanye’s voluptuous breasts almost touched his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye was shorter than Qing Shui by half a head. She tilted her head slightly upward. Her beautiful eyes seemed like they were rippling with mystified water as her movements and expressions seemed to be inviting him in for a sampling or taste.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Qing Shui’s head was uncontrollably fuzzy. When he regained his consciousness, he realized he was hugging Qing Hanye’s delicate body and his mouth was already planted unto her lips…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was going crazy in his head. As he was about to let go of his hands and retreat, he realized that Qing Hanye was already embracing him and even had her sweet tongue awkwardly inserted into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smooth, delicate fragrance and an indescribable captivating taste made Qing Shui forget himself for a while. If a man decided to retreat from a woman’s initiative, then he wouldn’t be a real man at all. Moreover, this woman had liked him since a long time ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Qing Shui had some feelings for her. Any man would like a unique woman who could captivate an entire city with her elegance and talent like her. On top of that, judging by the previous experiences, it would be better to let some things progress naturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui greedily sucked on her tongue, allowing the refreshing taste to infatuate his mind. He embraced Qing Hanye with both of his hands. The pressure on his chest felt as if his body was about to soar to the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, Qing Hanye’s awkward kiss allowed Qing Shui to understand that this talented woman hadn’t had physical contact with a man for a very long time. He didn’t even resist his instincts, which clearly explained what he was thinking right now. The doubts he had before had dissipated completely from his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most concerning thing in the mind of a woman like her was her own body. She would rather let herself die than compromise herself for the interest of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was very fond of the wonderful sensation on his palms as he gently squeezed her voluptuous butt. Qing Hanye slightly gasped for breath as she pushed away Qing Shui. Her face was flushed in red, seemingly enjoying the moment as she gazed at him. At that moment, Qing Shui couldn’t resist the charm emanating from her natural femininity. In the next moment, he quickly extended his arms and groped her breasts….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye moaned from his touch. Qing Shui quickly let out an awkward laugh as he let go of his hands and slightly regained his composure, “You are a vixen. I can’t resist you. Is it painful? Do you want me to give you a bit of massage…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye looked back at him with misty eyes. It wasn’t intentional when she showed him her enchanting expression, as it was caused naturally from her bones. She puffed and said, “You are rough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui held onto her hand, embarrassed. He felt a bit sorry for his actions. After all, he did use too much force when he had groped her. However, when he realized that Qing Hanye wasn’t angry at all, he felt a bit happy. A woman would make herself beautiful for her lover, after all. Qing Shui’s previous boorish act proved that she was at least attracted to this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for love, anyone would know that when one person liked the other to the limit, it would become love. Even so, it would require time to come into fruition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye embraced Qing Shui’s neck and slowly leaned on him, “I’ve waited for this day for so long but a blockhead like you never seemed to understand that. Or maybe you just don’t like me at all?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My young lady, there aren’t any normal men in this world who wouldn’t like you. I already have a woman, and not just one. I was just afraid you would be bothered by this.” Since he had openly talked about it, he didn’t make it feel sentimental anymore. He was telling the truth. Anyone would want to conquer a beautiful woman, but she didn’t want the previous women to feel bothered, and she didn’t want future women to feel bothered either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really think that we don’t know how a man behaves? Since we like you so much, we will overlook this, at the very least. This kind of concept has been changing everyone in the world without them noticing. It’s the most normal phenomenon; an excellent man having one woman in his life is the rarest sight in this world.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, are you disturbed by it?” Qing Shui actually knew the answer already. He felt quite at ease right now. The barrier between men and women was akin to a piece of paper. Once the paper had been pierced through, they would become like one single person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I would feel more disturbed if I follow someone else. If you don’t want me, then I won’t find other men. So this is a good deal only for you.” Qing Hanye smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui extended his hand and slapped her butt. The distinct sound felt as if it could charm him further. He then said, feeling speechless, “What do you mean by that? Why is it a good deal only for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, Big Brother, I’m wrong. I won’t do it again.” Qing Hanye said, slightly pouting with a pitiful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui could only force a laugh when he saw her expression. Even though this vixen was young, because of her cultivation techniques and her knowledge on how to please a man, a few words from her were able to rouse a reaction from Qing Shui easily, an aggressive one at that….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was sure that his concentration did not become weak. Even though he wasn’t exactly a gentleman, he realized that he couldn’t suppress his inner flame even if he tried very hard to. However, this type of flame was at another critical point, but not to the extent of releasing the beast within him. Even if that was the case, it didn’t feel very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye knew Qing Shui had a bodily reaction. After all, there was a hard thing pointing at her lower abdomen. She wasn’t actually that calm as her appearance showed because she was also nervous, deep inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. I will escort you. If we keep going like this, I’m afraid I might not be able to resist myself and eat you up.” Qing Shui pulled Qing Hanye by her hand and headed toward Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye curled a faint smile on her mouth. She had an indescribable charm and elegance within her, and she wasn’t a woman that those with just a bewitching aura could compare to. Although she was charming, there was a sense of purity in her appeal. She was elegant, yet dignified as well. Most of the time, she would become a little lady, making others want to protect her at all costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked into Dragonwolf Palace with her together. Even though it was his first time coming here, it didn’t feel unfamiliar to him. When the Spirit Fish came here last time, he was able to see a lot of things here through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Let me take you to see my master. She is a very kind old woman.” Qing Hanye would completely relax whenever she mentioned her master, just like how a child would with her parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” Qing Shui also wanted to meet this old woman. After all, she was the one who helped Qing Hanye. Otherwise, no one would know what could possibly happen to Qing Hanye herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The highest structure in the Eastern Peak Dragonwolf Palace was a Dragonwolf statue about a thousand meters high. It stood high and mighty. One would feel a sense of suppression upon lifting up his head to look at it. If he had to view the statue using his perception of his past life, it would be impossible to understand how this structure was built in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to the legends, this Dragonwolf statue is said to have been formed by a real Dragonwolf. They say it is for the sake of protecting the Dragonwolf Palace for all time. Qing Shui, do you think it’s true?” Qing Hanye asked with a smile. At that moment, the two of them were no longer holding hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t matter whether it is real or not. If it can really protect the Dragonwolf Palace, then that’s great.” Qing Shui replied as he looked at the Dragonwolf statue. He actually didn’t believe that this statue was formed by a real Dragonwolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re here. Master lives here. Let’s go in!” They arrived to a secluded, isolated small courtyard when she said that. There were no guards to be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui only realized that this place was actually huge when he entered the courtyard. It was extremely secluded. There were various flora and fauna inside the courtyard, including a variety of fish ponds and simulated boulders. Even so, they were not extravagant but extremely cozy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old woman with snow-white hair and white clothes was currently trimming the plants with a pair of scissors. She was solemn as she trimmed those flowers without being affected by the surroundings in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Hanye looked at the old woman with saturated gentleness. It was a non-verbal act of mellow feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui stood there quietly as he accompanied Qing Hanye by her side. He knew that this old woman definitely realized Qing Hanye had arrived, but didn’t intend to turn around immediately to affirm that it was really her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the time for a stick of incense to burn was up, the old woman finally turned around. It was at this moment that Qing Shui was able to see her face clearly. The old woman’s face didn’t seem like she had aged that much, yet there were deep wrinkles visible all over. In fact, those wrinkles made her seem more amiable than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” Qing Hanye happily ran over to hug the old woman’s wrist when she saw her turning around. Looking at her cheerful appearance, Qing Hanye seemed like a child who had found her parents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had their own safe harbor that only belonged to them. Qing Shui’s safe harbor was his home. Actually, most people considered their home to be their safe harbor. However, there would be some exceptions to their choices, like lovers or concubines…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman smiled when she saw Qing Hanye. She then walked toward Qing Shui with her, prompting Qing Shui to quickly move two steps forward and greet, “Your junior respectfully greets senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui used the most common etiquette to greet her. Upon seeing Qing Shui, the old woman seemed particularly happy, and was very curious as well. She gazed thoughtfully at Qing Shui with her wise eyes and said, “You and Qing’er are born to be a pair. Only you can endure her.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you saying, master?!” Qing Hanye was a woman who had not been sexually active, after all. So she was a bit embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was shocked when he realized an important fact. While he had the Nine Yang Body, Qing Hanye had the Nine Yin Body. The old woman was right. Just by the old woman's perception alone, it was enough to justify how terrifying her power was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have another matter that I would like senior to decide for us. I would like you to give your approval in regards to Ye'er and I.” Qing Shui said, straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you are a smart person. If I disapprove of it, you will definitely call me a melodramatic woman. All in all, due to the constitution of your bodies, I have nothing to worry about. I just hope you can promise me one thing.” The old woman said, contentedly.</span></p>
