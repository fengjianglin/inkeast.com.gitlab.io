 <p><strong>AST 1033 - Father, Huoyun Peng, Mental Burden Removed, Some Things Couldn't Be Helped</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Huoyun Liu-Li and Qing Yu headed towards the Buddha Sword Sect the next day. After one day, this matter had spread out very quickly amongst the top powers, as if it had grown a pair of wings. Although the Buddha Sect had tried to stop the news from spreading out, they weren't very successful.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui's name was listed as ‘the top person one should not trifle with’ amongst the top powers. Of course, they all wanted to get close to Qing Shui and the Qing Clan, but they weren’t daring enough to come forth to talk or visit them at the Qing Clan's residence.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qing Shui felt even more at ease. The Great Golden Buddha Palm which he had cultivated last night was definitely stronger than the old man's. It could be due to cultivating the Ancient Strengthening Technique, or it might be related to the Nature Energy and other stuff.</p>
 <p>Riding on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, Qing Shui used his Qi of the Ancient Strengthening Technique to protect Huoyun Liu-Li and Qing Yu who was in his arms. Although the sound of the wind should be very strong, they didn't hear anything. The lass was playing happily with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Qing Yu was very playful and Qing Shui looked at Huoyun Liu-Li happily as he said, "The lass is like you. I was very docile when I was young."</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li's face turned dim, but quickly broke into a smile, "Of course my daughter is like me. Is that not good?"</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li, don't think about it too much. Your mental burden should be released. Let them reunite. Of course, we'll need to see what your father says." Qing Shui saw the dimness in Huoyun Liu-Li's eyes and he quickly consoled her.</p>
 <p>"I'm fine. So many years have passed. I'm very happy now. My greatest happiness in this life is to have met you. Thinking back on our encounter, it was really very incredible." When Huoyun Liu-Li mentioned these, she was especially happy.</p>
 <p>"That's right. This is fate. Back then, I was stunned to see such a pretty elder sister with such good disposition for the first time. I was already thinking how good would it be if I can bring you home with me." Qing Shui said teasingly.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, back then you were just a shy little boy, but right now your skin is thicker than the city's wall." Huoyun Liu-Li chided, but broke out laughing very fast. She seemed to feel very gratified when she thought of the past.</p>
 <p>Qing Yu would also point her finger to some flying demonic beasts at the far distance happily. Every time she saw one, she would point to them excitedly as she shouted.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was very fast and considering that the journey to the Buddha Sword Sect wasn't very far, they soon arrived at the Buddha Mountain's Buddha Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>No one had stopped them on their way up and they only got off the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant when they reached the top of the mountain. Within a day, Qing Shui became famous in the entire Buddha Sword Sect, which was why someone very quickly came out to the door to welcome him.</p>
 <p>An old man was in the lead and there were over ten people behind him. Qing Shui could guess what status they held after he sensed their abilities. Moreover, the dignified aura that the old man exuded also gave him some clues. Even if he wasn't the Buddha Sword Sect's sovereign, his status wouldn't be that low either.</p>
 <p>There was another old man behind the first one who kept staring at them. He could sense a sinister aura from him, but it wasn't something which made Qing Shui concerned.</p>
 <p>"Hello, Qing Shui. I'm Huoyun Peng's father." The old man in the lead looked at Qing Shui and said with slight awkwardness.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui heard his introduction, he knew what the other party was thinking. He was trying to forge a connection of kinship with them. Before he spoke, the old man's voice rang out again.</p>
 <p>"You're Peng`er's lass, the two of you look so much alike. It's been so many years, Peng`er didn't tell us. We have let you suffer."</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was stunned. He had seen shameless people, but not one who was to this extent. He looked at the old man calmly and said, "Hello!"</p>
 <p>After that, Qing Shui turned to Huoyun Liu-Li. She already knew who wanted to kill her, but she was only able to live because they didn't know her. She said without any expression, "Where is Huoyun Peng?"</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li's words were very clear and the Buddha Sword Sect's sovereign knew what she meant. He felt very resentful. This was his own granddaughter. If she agreed to acknowledge him as her grandfather, then Qing Shui would be his grandson-in-law.</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li, this is a Youth Retaining Pellet and this is a Jade Phoenix Pellet. Take them as Grandfather's meeting gift for you." The old man took out two porcelain bottles.</p>
 <p>"Thank you for your kind thoughts. I still have things to attend to. Qing Shui, let's go look for Huoyun Peng!" her last sentence was directed to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li couldn't forgive the person who wanted to kill her, moreover it was her own grandfather. On the way back from Demon Gate, the two people from the Buddha Sword Sect had wanted to kill her.</p>
 <p>"Biao`er, bring them over!" The old man let out a sigh and said.</p>
 <p>"Yes, Father!"</p>
 <p>A middle-aged man walked out, before he smiled to Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li and said, "Please follow me!"</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui smiled and said before he left together with Qing Yu and Huoyun Liu-Li.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng was the Buddha Sword Sect Sovereign's fifth son. Which son was this Biao`er? Qing Shui decided not to give it much thought. Right now, the thing that was on his mind the most was if Huoyun Peng wasn't someone good, he wouldn't mind killing a few people from the Buddha Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>On the way, Qing Shui realized that the place where Huoyun Peng was staying at was very similar to where Mo Hongluo had stayed. Both places were equally remote and in the same direction.</p>
 <p>"Fifth brother, see who's here to visit you today!"</p>
 <p>Before they entered, the man's clear voice rang out, as he pushed the door open to the courtyard. This was a very remote place, but the environment was good. The trees were well-matched with the design in the courtyard, it looked very pleasing and quiet.</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui saw Huoyun Peng, he was also astonished. Huoyun Peng was considered to be very strong for his age. Although he couldn't be compared to Qing Shui and Little Fatty, for his age, Huoyun Peng was someone that could definitely be considered as a great genius at his level.</p>
 <p>Another thing was that the contouring between Huoyun Liu-Li's and Huoyun Peng's brows and nose were exactly the same. The man looked at Huoyun Liu-Li in a daze and casted a quick glance at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Staying here, Huoyun Peng didn't know what had happened outside. For all these years, he had been living like an ascetic monk. However, an indescribable feeling grew in him when he saw Huoyun Liu-Li, it was a very familiar and amazing feeling.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng seemed to have forgotten to ask Huoyun Biao who this person was or to even ask Huoyun Liu-Li directly. Right now, he was stunned by that amazing feeling.</p>
 <p>"Hello, I am Huoyun Liu-Li."</p>
 <p>Her soft voice sounded like exploding thunder to Huoyun Peng, even his body trembled, "Lass, you're Liu-Li lass, you're my daughter."</p>
 <p>Huoyun Biao nodded to Qing Shui and left. Qing Shui carried Qing Yu and didn't leave. He didn't know what the situation was like in the Huoyun Clan and although a vicious tiger wouldn't kill its own kids, sometimes humans are simply worse than beasts.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li looked in a daze at this handsome man who appeared to be slightly down and out, "Do you still remember this daughter?"</p>
 <p>"I remember. Your father has failed you, but I've never once forgotten about you and your mother. Father has been working hard all along and hoped that one day our family could’ve been reunited. I've always been working hard..."</p>
 <p>"If I were to ask you to leave this place now, will you?" Huoyun Liu-Li looked at the man and said seriously.</p>
 <p>"I will. Daughter, why are you here? Do they know that you're called Huoyun Liu-Li..." Suddenly Huoyun Peng appeared to be very anxious and worried.</p>
 <p>"Father... It's alright now. Everything's over."</p>
 <p>"Over? They are willing to give way?" Huoyun Peng was very clear about what kind of people they were and thus looked at Huoyun Liu-Li in shock.</p>
 <p>"Father, this is my husband. He had brought me along and fought his way here. I'm here to bring Father with me to reunite with Mother. Please leave with me!" Huoyun Liu-Li's face was tears stricken.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng walked over, tried three times to reach out his hands and carefully wiped off Huoyun Liu-Li's tears.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li threw herself into Huoyun Peng's arms and cried very hard. Huoyun Peng couldn't help as he cried too.</p>
 <p>After a while, Huoyun Peng and Huoyun Liu-Li walked towards Qing Shui. "Thank you. This must be Yu`er!"</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng took out a small wooden figurine. It was a wooden carving of a young lass and he handed it to Qing Yu. "I didn’t have any gifts prepared for you. I'll give you this!"</p>
 <p>Qing Yu was very happy to receive the wooden figurine and Huoyun Liu-Li broke into a smile too. She knew that this little wooden figurine was an image of her when she was young. Before she said anything, Huoyun Peng had taken out a box.</p>
 <p>When he opened it, many wooden figurines were revealed. They were about the same as the one from before, but they were in different postures. Their expressions were different as well. Some of them were crying, some were smiling, some were sitting, and some were lying down.</p>
 <p>"Liu-Li, my memory of you is when you were only at this age. In the future, Father will carve you a wooden figurine every year." Huoyun Peng handed Huoyun Liu-Li the box.</p>
 <p>"Father, this is the best present I have seen! Let's go and meet Mother!" Huoyun Liu-Li said to Huoyun Peng.</p>
 <p>"Alright. Lass, can Father go and have a talk with them first? After all, I'm a member of the Huoyun Clan and I'd like to tell them about my departure. Sometimes, there are things which can't be helped." Huoyun Peng hesitated before he said softly.</p>
 <p>"As our parents' kids, this is something we should do. Liu-Li and I will go outside and wait for senior!" Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li held the box in her arms and nodded.</p>
 <p>Before they left, Liu-Li let Qing Yu call Huoyun Peng ‘grandfather’. Having accepted the wooden figurine from Huoyun Peng, Qing Yu did so with a very crisp voice. It made Huoyun Peng so happy that he played with Qing Yu for a while before he gave her back to Qing Shui with a little hint of unwillingness.</p>
 <p>Back then, his own daughter Liu-Li wasn't even as old as this lass when they were separated. He didn’t even have a chance to enjoy a happy family life before he was put through the tremendous pain of separation. This separation ended up being over 30 years and just the thought of it made him felt aggrieved.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li took the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant and flew away, as they headed outside the Buddha Mountain.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Peng knew how powerful the Buddha Sect was. To think that this young man had succeeded to accomplish something that he himself didn't have the confidence to, even after he had worked hard for over 30 years. He was very astonished. He headed to the direction of the main hall, as he also wanted to know what had happened in detail.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Huoyun Liu-Li waited at the foot of the mountain. There were still tear stains on Huoyun Liu-Li's face. She looked at the wooden figurines and how they were carefully polished. Each figurine was carved out very delicately, with his heart poured in.</p>
 <p>"We'll head to Demon Gate later and let your father meet your mother. Your family has reunited, you should put down the burden in your heart now. They do love you, both of them." Qing Shui was very happy as well.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, thank you!"</p>
 <p>"Mmm, seems like you've forgotten again. I shall punish you with our house rules tonight." Qing Shui grinned.</p>
 <p>"I'm not scared of you." Huoyun Liu-Li threw Qing Shui a charming glance.</p>
 <p>Not long later Huoyun Peng came out, threading in the air. Qing Shui let him land on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Huoyun Peng now knew the whole story. He didn't even know that the Buddha Sect had wanted to kill Liu-Li until earlier.</p>
 <p>He was infuriated. Although he could guess this, he hadn't expected Liu-Li to appear. The Huoyun Clan wanted him to stay, but he still decided to leave.</p>
