  <p dir="ltr"><strong>566 - Arrival At The Jade Sea Country, Drunken Immortal Restaurant, Nian Feng</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright. Since this incident has already involved the Di Clan, it’d naturally be endless. It’s about time you temper yourself. Follow your Third Uncle to the mountain valley and learn through experience.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, father!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Jade Sea Country!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After a week, Qing Shui flew into the Jade Sea Country. The moment he entered the Jade Sea Country, he landed the Fire Bird on the ‘Sky Platform’ of the city.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The ‘Sky Platform’ was the place where big carriages and flying beasts transited. Since it was too crowded in other places and it was very easy to cause a traffic jam, this place was built specially for parking big carriages and flying beasts.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir, where are you headed to?” The voice of the coachman rang out clearly after Qing Shui climbed up onto a beast carriage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Take me to the best inn nearby!” Qing Shui answered after thinking for a moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Aye!” The beast carriage quickly sped off!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave the coachman an ingot of silver before he climbed up the carriage. At least the coachman was honest, the beast carriage galloped for almost an hour before coming to a halt.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir, this is the Drunken Immortal Inn. It’s considered the best inn in this area.” The coachman introduced the place to Qing Shui politely.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had given the coachman a nod as a silent approval for him to leave and to express his satisfaction about the place that the coachman had found.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A majestic inn stood before him in its glorious splendor. The tallest buildings in the World of Nine Continents were most often this kind of inn that had rooms and restaurants.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The inn spanned over a large area, and although it was tall, it only had about ten floors. Qing Shui had always thought that the Earthly Paradise in the Canglang Country was the best, but now he thought that it was slightly inferior to this ‘Drunk Immortal Inn’.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Eight gorgeous and sexily dressed waitresses stood at the entrance. They were wearing clothes with the same design. They smiled at the people who were coming and going while greeting some of them from time to time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Uniform?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui chuckled. It seemed like no matter which era it was, self-taught techniques like these would emerge. Inns would basically use the same methods to attract customers.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He saw some people stuffing a silver note into the deep cleavage of the waitresses when they went in. Qing Shui rubbed his nose. Wasn’t this kind of thing old-fashioned?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">There was an endless stream of horse and carriages at the front entrance of the ‘Drunken Immortal Inn’. The people who visited this place were rarely commoners, but rich tycoons or cultivators that were armed with weapons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Due to the fact that martial arts were worshiped in the World of the Nine Continents, the positions of even poor cultivators were not inferior to those of businessmen. This is because a truly rich tycoon was backed up by powerful martial forces.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Welcome!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The eight ladies dressed in their uniforms bowed and clearly greeted Qing Shui when he reached the entrance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">This was the first time Qing Shui had experienced such an enjoyable treatment. He looked at the few youthful and beautiful ladies and he felt his mood being greatly lifted. He pulled out a few silver dollar notes and stuffed them in between those large bosoms like the others had done, as he enjoyed the act of a rich man.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t think any less of these people. Perhaps it was because he had spent a long time in the World of the Nine Continents and had gotten used to the open existence of brothels, but he didn’t feel that they had a lowly status. Prostitutes were their own breadwinners and were mentally stronger than bandits who robbed. Furthermore, most of them were forced into this position by circumstances.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Besides, he felt that it was essential to have all kinds of people in this vast world. The world was only splendid and interesting because it was made up by a diversity of people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Everyone thought lowly of prostitutes, but those patrons and people who had forced the prostitutes were actually more lowly than them.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">No harm was done if she was willing!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had no idea if those waitresses were that kind of prostitutes. But judging from what he had observed, they seemed to be in a somewhat better situation than that. The guests only copped a feel at most!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found himself in a grand lobby as soon as he entered the ‘Drunken Immortal Inn’. Many waitresses like those at the entrance stood there. They’d step forward to entertain the guests who came in.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir, are you here to enjoy a meal or have a rest?” A tall and slender young woman came forward to Qing Shui with a smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Get me a room first. As for the meal, I will eat at the lobby later,” Qing Shui replied after thinking.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure, please follow me!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman led the way and Qing Shui followed behind her, admiring how her hips swayed alluringly as she walked. As expected of the best inn, even the quality and appearance of their waitresses were top notch.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir, the rooms below the fifth floor are all occupied. Do you prefer to stay on the fifth floor or above the fifth floor?” The woman turned her head around and inquired.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’d like the highest floor!” Qing Shui replied after pondering for a moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m terribly sorry, sir. The highest floor is not open to the public,” the woman apologetically informed him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Find me a room one floor below the highest floor then!” He hadn’t expected that the highest floor was not open to the public. He had wanted to stay on the highest floor so he could enjoy the night scenery whenever he was free and could also get a wider view.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman slowly led Qing Shui upstairs. Watching the woman slowly going up the beautiful staircase reminded him of a familiar scene where he was also following behind a woman up a staircase.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yu He!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The wonderful scene from that time replayed in Qing Shui’s mind. He could still remember the soft and tender sensations that he felt in his hands. But everything felt very distant now. Only that willful and delicate face clearly lingered in his mind.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When he remembered the stubborness that she had shown when they parted ways, he felt as if his heart was being pricked by a needle. He had given her hope, but then destroyed that hope with his own hands...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had always been passive in affections and was very rarely initiative. He was only considered proactive when it came to Shi Qingzhuang. He knew that it was because of the circumstances of their meeting and on top of that, Shi Qingzhuang was the very first woman who had touched his heart when he saw her at the Qing Residence a long time ago. The adoration he had for her had no other intentions in it.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ll go with the flow!” Qing Shui sighed inwardly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Without realizing it, they had reached the ninth floor. There were way fewer people here compared to the earlier floors. There was a huge living room right in the middle with a few gorgeous rectangular tables and chairs neatly arranged. A few groups of people were there enjoying their meal or wine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The corridor surrounded the room in the shape resembling something like 回. This was the World of the Nine Continent’s architectural style. Perhaps because of the height, Qing Shui could tell with his spiritual sense that the guests staying above the fifth floor were all cultivators.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sir, what do you think of this room?” The woman didn’t talk much, but her every word was on point. He presumed that even bad tempered or unpleasant guests would hardly feel dissatisfied in her service. Besides, this woman was quite a beauty.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood at the entrance and observed the room. He could see a fully furnished small living room that looked like it would be a cozy home. There was also a bedroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom. However, the kitchens here were most likely just decorations because you could eat anything here. People who could stay here would surely be able to afford to order whatever they wanted to eat on the menu.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’ll take this room then. Bring me a few of the signature dishes here!” Qing Shui gave the woman a smile and then walked towards the table on the side.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a seat at a table near the corridor and observed the people around him. There were only less than twenty people scattered around the room. Perhaps this was because it wasn’t lunch time yet.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Have you guys heard that a lot of treasure beasts have been appearing at the Jade Sea?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just when Qing Shui was getting bored, a very interesting story rang out from another table. This was the first time he had heard of treasure beasts…...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Treasure beasts? What treasure beasts? It’s not surprising that there’s a treasure beast in the vast Jade Sea. There has always been a rumor about it over the past few years,” a middle aged guy who was sitting at one side asked. He seemed to be slightly interested in this topic.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s different this time. Many people saw it. It was a Crystal Lion,” a youth spoke up for the first time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Crystal Lion? What is that?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I’m not too sure myself. That time, I saw a little azure lion with a crystal-like body. It was only about the size of a fist and its entire body was covered in scales. I heard a lot of people say that it was a Crystal Lion, a type of treasure beast that could secrete a crystal from its body. According to them, this item was very valuable. It was a priceless treasure……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui eavesdropped with a frown. He had once again picked up news about the Jade Sea. The Jade Sea was his main objective for coming to the Jade Sea Country. It seemed like he had to make haste to the Jade Sea.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just then, the waitress from earlier came over carrying a large tray that was wrapped in a brocade fabric. “Sir, these are the Jade Sea specialty dishes. We have steamed conch, braised Jade Whitefish, Five Spices Twin-headed Turtle meat……”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is the Jade Sea very vast?” Qing Shui felt like he had just asked a very childish question.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman pursed her lips up in a smile. “Yes, it’s boundlessly vast.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Are these aquatic products caught by yourselves somewhere or do you actually buy these from some sellers who are specialized in this industry?” Qing Shui motioned for the woman to take a seat.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I shall remain standing as it’s a rule,” the woman smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave her a smile and didn’t insist any further!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s not easy to catch aquatic products from the Jade Sea unless you are a veteran hunter. Most inns purchase these from those professional hunters, unless they have their own team of hunters. Fortunately, our inn has their own dedicated team, so you can rest easy, sir.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. This woman was really dedicated to her work. Even in the process of explaining, she didn’t forget to advertise for the Drunken Immortal Inn!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Is the Jade Sea dangerous?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Yes, it can be. But it is usually not dangerous under normal circumstances, unless you venture into the deep sea region. It is said that some especially ferocious water beasts dwell there.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui liked the way the woman talked. Her appearance, mannerism, and virtue were all top notch. It was as if there was an invisible cordial air surrounding her. He felt extremely relaxed talking to her. She was your typical girl-next-door, which Qing Shui liked the most in his previous life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Since this inn is known as the Drunken Immortal Inn, how about serving the best wine you have?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“No problem at all!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman nodded her head with a smile and left!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When the wine was served, Qing Shui discovered that the wine was named the ‘Drunken Immortal Wine’. He immediately took a sip and thought that it was quite delicious.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was aromatic, rich but not overwhelmingly so. Just a taste thoroughly refreshed him from inside out. However, this wine had a cold-attribute. Although it could actually strengthen the drinker’s constitution, its effects were neutralized by this cold-attribute. So the Drunken Immortal Wine was nothing more than just a delicious wine without any benefits.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“Is your boss around? I would like to discuss something with him about the wine,” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a moment.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had a feeling that the person who could establish the Drunken Immortal Inn was definitely not an ordinary person. He would either be someone from a big clan or a local tyrant. The moment he arrived at the Jade Sea Country, he had felt the need to get acquainted with some important people.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman frowned slightly. She looked at Qing Shui as if she didn’t know what to do!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized the reason after thinking a bit. If she had to bring anyone who said they wanted to meet her boss, then her boss would be really busy. So normally if there was nothing important, the boss was not to be bothered.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at the woman. “Tell him that someone can help him get rid of the cold-attribute in this wine and would like to meet him!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The woman nodded happily and left after hearing Qing Shui’s words!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After fifteen minutes, the woman from earlier returned with a young man. The man looked like he was in his thirties. He was plainly dressed, yet appeared to be very refined. He had a very dashing appearance and was a very standard handsome man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The boss of this Drunken Immortal Inn was this young?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Hello, I am Nian Feng, the manager of this inn. May I know your name, sir? How about we go upstairs and have a chat?” The man looked at Qing Shui with a smile as he went straight to the point.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure. I am Qing Shui, and you may call me that!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Then you may call me Nian Feng!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Kewei, ask the kitchen to prepare a few dishes!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng and Qing Shui walked side by side to the highest floor. “Brother Qing Shui, I’m guessing that you are not a local.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. I have just arrived at the Jade Sea Country today. This is considered my first stop, so I feel like it’s fate that we met each other.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“That’s right, I feel the same too. To be able to meet and exchange a word with someone among the sea of people could be considered a great fate itself. Even to be able to just see someone is also considered fate since you can’t really see that many people over your lifetime. Maybe a hundred thousand? Two hundred thousand?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng laughed lightly, as a trace of sadness could be heard from the tone of his voice. It was a pity that Qing Shui didn’t continue this line of conversation but he instead changed the topic. “Brother Nian Feng, it must not have been easy to manage an inn!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s still alright. It gets a little busy so I have less time to cultivate!” Nian Feng laughed embarrassedly, perhaps because he recalled how emotional he was just now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The two of them arrived on the highest floor very soon. There wasn’t anyone else there. A big field entered into Qing Shui’s field of vision and he immediately knew that it was a place for cultivation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">They walked into a very big living room. Nian Feng asked him to take a seat on the sofa as he sat across him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, can you really get rid of the cold-attribute in this wine?” Nian Feng asked without beating around the bushes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Just then, two waitresses came in with a tray of wine and dishes. They skillfully placed them on the tea table in order and then slowly took their leave. The wine served was still the Drunken Immortal Wine that he had just now, but Qing Shui could tell that it was of a higher grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The dishes was different and obviously not on the same level as just now. Their flavor and quality were way better.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I have another type of wine with me, would you like to have a taste?” Qing Shui took out a jar of Tiger Bone Liquor!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He immediately opened it and poured out two glasses. The sweet fragrance of the wine was even more tempting than the intoxicating fragrance of the wine, but it was very similar in flavor to this Drunken Immortal wine.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng picked up a glass and looked at Qing Shui in amazement!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave him a nod as he picked up the other glass from the table and downed the content in one gulp!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng smiled and gave him a nod. His smile was very sincere as he similarly downed the content of the glass in one gulp. After that, he stared at Qing Shui dumbfoundedly as amazement filled his eyes.</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><strong>566 - Arrival At The Jade Sea Country, Drunken Immortal Restaurant, Nian Feng</strong></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright. Since this incident has already involved the Di Clan, it’d naturally be endless. It’s about time you temper yourself. Follow your Third Uncle to the mountain valley and learn through experience.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, father!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Jade Sea Country!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After a week, Qing Shui flew into the Jade Sea Country. The moment he entered the Jade Sea Country, he landed the Fire Bird on the ‘Sky Platform’ of the city.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The ‘Sky Platform’ was the place where big carriages and flying beasts transited. Since it was too crowded in other places and it was very easy to cause a traffic jam, this place was built specially for parking big carriages and flying beasts.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sir, where are you headed to?” The voice of the coachman rang out clearly after Qing Shui climbed up onto a beast carriage.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Take me to the best inn nearby!” Qing Shui answered after thinking for a moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Aye!” The beast carriage quickly sped off!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave the coachman an ingot of silver before he climbed up the carriage. At least the coachman was honest, the beast carriage galloped for almost an hour before coming to a halt.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sir, this is the Drunken Immortal Inn. It’s considered the best inn in this area.” The coachman introduced the place to Qing Shui politely.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had given the coachman a nod as a silent approval for him to leave and to express his satisfaction about the place that the coachman had found.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A majestic inn stood before him in its glorious splendor. The tallest buildings in the World of Nine Continents were most often this kind of inn that had rooms and restaurants.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The inn spanned over a large area, and although it was tall, it only had about ten floors. Qing Shui had always thought that the Earthly Paradise in the Canglang Country was the best, but now he thought that it was slightly inferior to this ‘Drunk Immortal Inn’.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Eight gorgeous and sexily dressed waitresses stood at the entrance. They were wearing clothes with the same design. They smiled at the people who were coming and going while greeting some of them from time to time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Uniform?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui chuckled. It seemed like no matter which era it was, self-taught techniques like these would emerge. Inns would basically use the same methods to attract customers.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He saw some people stuffing a silver note into the deep cleavage of the waitresses when they went in. Qing Shui rubbed his nose. Wasn’t this kind of thing old-fashioned?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">There was an endless stream of horse and carriages at the front entrance of the ‘Drunken Immortal Inn’. The people who visited this place were rarely commoners, but rich tycoons or cultivators that were armed with weapons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Due to the fact that martial arts were worshiped in the World of the Nine Continents, the positions of even poor cultivators were not inferior to those of businessmen. This is because a truly rich tycoon was backed up by powerful martial forces.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Welcome!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The eight ladies dressed in their uniforms bowed and clearly greeted Qing Shui when he reached the entrance.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">This was the first time Qing Shui had experienced such an enjoyable treatment. He looked at the few youthful and beautiful ladies and he felt his mood being greatly lifted. He pulled out a few silver dollar notes and stuffed them in between those large bosoms like the others had done, as he enjoyed the act of a rich man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui didn’t think any less of these people. Perhaps it was because he had spent a long time in the World of the Nine Continents and had gotten used to the open existence of brothels, but he didn’t feel that they had a lowly status. Prostitutes were their own breadwinners and were mentally stronger than bandits who robbed. Furthermore, most of them were forced into this position by circumstances.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Besides, he felt that it was essential to have all kinds of people in this vast world. The world was only splendid and interesting because it was made up by a diversity of people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Everyone thought lowly of prostitutes, but those patrons and people who had forced the prostitutes were actually more lowly than them.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">No harm was done if she was willing!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had no idea if those waitresses were that kind of prostitutes. But judging from what he had observed, they seemed to be in a somewhat better situation than that. The guests only copped a feel at most!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui found himself in a grand lobby as soon as he entered the ‘Drunken Immortal Inn’. Many waitresses like those at the entrance stood there. They’d step forward to entertain the guests who came in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sir, are you here to enjoy a meal or have a rest?” A tall and slender young woman came forward to Qing Shui with a smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Get me a room first. As for the meal, I will eat at the lobby later,” Qing Shui replied after thinking.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure, please follow me!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman led the way and Qing Shui followed behind her, admiring how her hips swayed alluringly as she walked. As expected of the best inn, even the quality and appearance of their waitresses were top notch.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sir, the rooms below the fifth floor are all occupied. Do you prefer to stay on the fifth floor or above the fifth floor?” The woman turned her head around and inquired.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’d like the highest floor!” Qing Shui replied after pondering for a moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m terribly sorry, sir. The highest floor is not open to the public,” the woman apologetically informed him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Find me a room one floor below the highest floor then!” He hadn’t expected that the highest floor was not open to the public. He had wanted to stay on the highest floor so he could enjoy the night scenery whenever he was free and could also get a wider view.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman slowly led Qing Shui upstairs. Watching the woman slowly going up the beautiful staircase reminded him of a familiar scene where he was also following behind a woman up a staircase.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yu He!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The wonderful scene from that time replayed in Qing Shui’s mind. He could still remember the soft and tender sensations that he felt in his hands. But everything felt very distant now. Only that willful and delicate face clearly lingered in his mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When he remembered the stubborness that she had shown when they parted ways, he felt as if his heart was being pricked by a needle. He had given her hope, but then destroyed that hope with his own hands...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had always been passive in affections and was very rarely initiative. He was only considered proactive when it came to Shi Qingzhuang. He knew that it was because of the circumstances of their meeting and on top of that, Shi Qingzhuang was the very first woman who had touched his heart when he saw her at the Qing Residence a long time ago. The adoration he had for her had no other intentions in it.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ll go with the flow!” Qing Shui sighed inwardly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Without realizing it, they had reached the ninth floor. There were way fewer people here compared to the earlier floors. There was a huge living room right in the middle with a few gorgeous rectangular tables and chairs neatly arranged. A few groups of people were there enjoying their meal or wine.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The corridor surrounded the room in the shape resembling something like 回. This was the World of the Nine Continent’s architectural style. Perhaps because of the height, Qing Shui could tell with his spiritual sense that the guests staying above the fifth floor were all cultivators.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sir, what do you think of this room?” The woman didn’t talk much, but her every word was on point. He presumed that even bad tempered or unpleasant guests would hardly feel dissatisfied in her service. Besides, this woman was quite a beauty.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stood at the entrance and observed the room. He could see a fully furnished small living room that looked like it would be a cozy home. There was also a bedroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom. However, the kitchens here were most likely just decorations because you could eat anything here. People who could stay here would surely be able to afford to order whatever they wanted to eat on the menu.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’ll take this room then. Bring me a few of the signature dishes here!” Qing Shui gave the woman a smile and then walked towards the table on the side.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui took a seat at a table near the corridor and observed the people around him. There were only less than twenty people scattered around the room. Perhaps this was because it wasn’t lunch time yet.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Have you guys heard that a lot of treasure beasts have been appearing at the Jade Sea?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just when Qing Shui was getting bored, a very interesting story rang out from another table. This was the first time he had heard of treasure beasts…...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Treasure beasts? What treasure beasts? It’s not surprising that there’s a treasure beast in the vast Jade Sea. There has always been a rumor about it over the past few years,” a middle aged guy who was sitting at one side asked. He seemed to be slightly interested in this topic.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s different this time. Many people saw it. It was a Crystal Lion,” a youth spoke up for the first time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Crystal Lion? What is that?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m not too sure myself. That time, I saw a little azure lion with a crystal-like body. It was only about the size of a fist and its entire body was covered in scales. I heard a lot of people say that it was a Crystal Lion, a type of treasure beast that could secrete a crystal from its body. According to them, this item was very valuable. It was a priceless treasure……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui eavesdropped with a frown. He had once again picked up news about the Jade Sea. The Jade Sea was his main objective for coming to the Jade Sea Country. It seemed like he had to make haste to the Jade Sea.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just then, the waitress from earlier came over carrying a large tray that was wrapped in a brocade fabric. “Sir, these are the Jade Sea specialty dishes. We have steamed conch, braised Jade Whitefish, Five Spices Twin-headed Turtle meat……”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is the Jade Sea very vast?” Qing Shui felt like he had just asked a very childish question.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman pursed her lips up in a smile. “Yes, it’s boundlessly vast.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Are these aquatic products caught by yourselves somewhere or do you actually buy these from some sellers who are specialized in this industry?” Qing Shui motioned for the woman to take a seat.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I shall remain standing as it’s a rule,” the woman smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave her a smile and didn’t insist any further!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s not easy to catch aquatic products from the Jade Sea unless you are a veteran hunter. Most inns purchase these from those professional hunters, unless they have their own team of hunters. Fortunately, our inn has their own dedicated team, so you can rest easy, sir.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled. This woman was really dedicated to her work. Even in the process of explaining, she didn’t forget to advertise for the Drunken Immortal Inn!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Is the Jade Sea dangerous?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, it can be. But it is usually not dangerous under normal circumstances, unless you venture into the deep sea region. It is said that some especially ferocious water beasts dwell there.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui liked the way the woman talked. Her appearance, mannerism, and virtue were all top notch. It was as if there was an invisible cordial air surrounding her. He felt extremely relaxed talking to her. She was your typical girl-next-door, which Qing Shui liked the most in his previous life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Since this inn is known as the Drunken Immortal Inn, how about serving the best wine you have?” Qing Shui laughed.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No problem at all!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman nodded her head with a smile and left!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When the wine was served, Qing Shui discovered that the wine was named the ‘Drunken Immortal Wine’. He immediately took a sip and thought that it was quite delicious.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">It was aromatic, rich but not overwhelmingly so. Just a taste thoroughly refreshed him from inside out. However, this wine had a cold-attribute. Although it could actually strengthen the drinker’s constitution, its effects were neutralized by this cold-attribute. So the Drunken Immortal Wine was nothing more than just a delicious wine without any benefits.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;“Is your boss around? I would like to discuss something with him about the wine,” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a moment.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had a feeling that the person who could establish the Drunken Immortal Inn was definitely not an ordinary person. He would either be someone from a big clan or a local tyrant. The moment he arrived at the Jade Sea Country, he had felt the need to get acquainted with some important people.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman frowned slightly. She looked at Qing Shui as if she didn’t know what to do!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui realized the reason after thinking a bit. If she had to bring anyone who said they wanted to meet her boss, then her boss would be really busy. So normally if there was nothing important, the boss was not to be bothered.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui smiled at the woman. “Tell him that someone can help him get rid of the cold-attribute in this wine and would like to meet him!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The woman nodded happily and left after hearing Qing Shui’s words!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After fifteen minutes, the woman from earlier returned with a young man. The man looked like he was in his thirties. He was plainly dressed, yet appeared to be very refined. He had a very dashing appearance and was a very standard handsome man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The boss of this Drunken Immortal Inn was this young?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hello, I am Nian Feng, the manager of this inn. May I know your name, sir? How about we go upstairs and have a chat?” The man looked at Qing Shui with a smile as he went straight to the point.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure. I am Qing Shui, and you may call me that!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then you may call me Nian Feng!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Kewei, ask the kitchen to prepare a few dishes!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Alright!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng and Qing Shui walked side by side to the highest floor. “Brother Qing Shui, I’m guessing that you are not a local.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s right. I have just arrived at the Jade Sea Country today. This is considered my first stop, so I feel like it’s fate that we met each other.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“That’s right, I feel the same too. To be able to meet and exchange a word with someone among the sea of people could be considered a great fate itself. Even to be able to just see someone is also considered fate since you can’t really see that many people over your lifetime. Maybe a hundred thousand? Two hundred thousand?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng laughed lightly, as a trace of sadness could be heard from the tone of his voice. It was a pity that Qing Shui didn’t continue this line of conversation but he instead changed the topic. “Brother Nian Feng, it must not have been easy to manage an inn!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s still alright. It gets a little busy so I have less time to cultivate!” Nian Feng laughed embarrassedly, perhaps because he recalled how emotional he was just now.&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The two of them arrived on the highest floor very soon. There wasn’t anyone else there. A big field entered into Qing Shui’s field of vision and he immediately knew that it was a place for cultivation.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">They walked into a very big living room. Nian Feng asked him to take a seat on the sofa as he sat across him.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Brother Qing Shui, can you really get rid of the cold-attribute in this wine?” Nian Feng asked without beating around the bushes.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Just then, two waitresses came in with a tray of wine and dishes. They skillfully placed them on the tea table in order and then slowly took their leave. The wine served was still the Drunken Immortal Wine that he had just now, but Qing Shui could tell that it was of a higher grade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The dishes was different and obviously not on the same level as just now. Their flavor and quality were way better.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I have another type of wine with me, would you like to have a taste?” Qing Shui took out a jar of Tiger Bone Liquor!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He immediately opened it and poured out two glasses. The sweet fragrance of the wine was even more tempting than the intoxicating fragrance of the wine, but it was very similar in flavor to this Drunken Immortal wine.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sure!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng picked up a glass and looked at Qing Shui in amazement!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gave him a nod as he picked up the other glass from the table and downed the content in one gulp!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Nian Feng smiled and gave him a nod. His smile was very sincere as he similarly downed the content of the glass in one gulp. After that, he stared at Qing Shui dumbfoundedly as amazement filled his eyes.</p>
