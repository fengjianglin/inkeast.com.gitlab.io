 <p><strong>AST 758 - Martial God Street, Wuma Aristocratic Clan</strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui had just finished when Ye Yan arrived. When she saw Qing Shui, she happily called out, “Uncle, let’s go eat.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui silently smiled and nodded his head. He once tried to get the little girl to call him brother, as that way he would not be placed in the same generation as Fei Wuji. However, it seemed that it wasn’t of much use..</p>
 <p>Qing Shui, Cang Wuya and the others walked together with Ye Yan toward the great hall. When Ye Guyan saw Qing Shui again, she could not help but be shocked. However, she recovered very quickly.</p>
 <p>Not seeing Qing Shui for one night, she discovered that this youth was a little different from yesterday. His complexion looked good, causing one to feel comfortable. Most importantly was his charm, which seemed to be calmer, similar to the confidence of someone strong.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa, Qing Shui, how is your stay here?” Ye Guyan stood at the entrance, welcoming them into the living room.</p>
 <p>“En, very good!” Cang Wuya smiled as he replied. By the side, Qing Shui also nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Although there was still only six people in the living room, it felt livelier than yesterday. Perhaps it was because everyone was now slightly more familiar to each other.</p>
 <p>“It must be hard for Miss Ye to manage such a big clan by yourself.” Qing Shui said casually while they were eating.</p>
 <p>“It’s not too bad, I am already used to it. I don’t really feel that it is hard. Since I’m willing to do it, I don’t feel tired.” Ye Guyan raised her head to look at Qing Shui and smiled, her attractive voice sounding especially pleasant. .</p>
 <p>“How is the relationship between the powers in Southern Sea City? I am quite curious.” After the table was cleared, Qing Shui asked Ye Guyan calmly.</p>
 <p>Yu Guyan looked at Qing Shui, her eyes gleamed before she smiled gently and whispered, “Between the sects and aristocratic clans, unless there is an alliance by marriage or they are subordinates, there are only beneficial relationships. Usually they seem to have good relationships. However, when disaster strikes, even the clans allied by marriage would retreat far away. After all, the most important thing was their own survival.</p>
 <p>“Has Miss Ye fought with Donggong Taiqing before?” Qing Shui looked at Ye Guyan, asking calmly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui actually wanted to directly ask Ye Guyan everything regarding the Eastern Palace Clan, but he felt that it was a little early. There was a saying, to both know yourself and the enemy is half the battle won.</p>
 <p>“I have not but I am slightly inferior. In a life or death battle, I might not lose but I would definitely not win.” Ye Guyan chuckled as she replied.</p>
 <p>“These aristocratic clans have no one they are close to? Even by marriage?” As Qing Shui asked this, he felt a little embarrassed. After all, he was not used to bombarding others with questions. Furthermore, the other party was someone that he was not that familiar with.</p>
 <p>“Haha, you have just arrived, it is normal to ask these questions. I will tell you everything that I know, there is no need to stand on ceremony.” Ye Guyan chuckled, seeming to have seen through Qing Shui’s awkwardness.</p>
 <p>Since she had said that, Qing Shui naturally felt better as it would be easier to speak of certain things. It was easy to have a good impression of such an understanding and intelligent woman.</p>
 <p>The Tantai Aristocratic Clan is a clan that has been passed down for a long time. It could be said that they are firmly rooted here and have many experts in their clan. In addition, they are very amicable. Therefore, no one dares to antagonize the Tantai Aristocratic Clan. They are the clan that many other clans would want to fawn upon.</p>
 <p>The Wuma Aristocratic Clan is very mysterious. Putuo Mountain and Sea King's Palace can be considered semi-secluded. The Southern Sky Poison Sect is a sect that specializes in poisons, thus most people would avoid them.</p>
 <p>The Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan is very arrogant. Adding that a genius had appeared, most people would not dare to antagonize them. An ordinary clan would not be able to shoulder the consequences of doing so. Their reputation isn’t good plus members of their younger generation are arrogant and domineering.</p>
 <p>The Violet Bamboo Forest is another unknown power but there is no doubt in their strength.” Ye Guyan slowly summarised the situation of the different powers to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Currently, it could be said that Qing Shui had a basic understanding of the major powers in Southern Sea City. Actually, his highest priority was understanding the situation of the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan.</p>
 <p>The above mentioned were the strongest powers in Southern Sea City. There were still many other smaller powers below them. For example, the Ye Clan, who could barely be considered a third rate Supreme Clan, just that they had a bigger potential.</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui finally understood that the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan also had a very bad reputation here. Their younger generations were prideful, arrogant, and domineering. It’s easy to understand once you think about it. Back then, those that the Old Ancestor met were also the younger generations of the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. It was due to their arrogant and domineering attitude that resulted in him coming to the Southern Viewing Continent today.</p>
 <p>Decades had passed and the Eastern Palace Clan was still the same, not changing their ways. They would run into trouble sooner or later, just that he was not sure if he would be the one to create disaster for them.</p>
 <p>“You just arrived at the Southern Sea City. How about I bring you to take a look around today?” Ye Guyan thought for a bit before looking and smiling at Qing Shui, Cang Wuya and the others.</p>
 <p>“I’m too old already, you go with Qing Shui. There is no need to bother with us old men.” Cang Wuya waved his hands and laughed loudly.</p>
 <p>Ye Guyan did not press the matter. When it was late in the morning, Qing Shui, Ye Guyan, and Ye Yan went out, flagging down a Beast Carriage the moment they went out.</p>
 <p>“Miss Ye, How far are we from the Southern Sea?” Qing Shui really wanted to see the sea. He had never seen the sea before in his previous life. In this life, he had only see the Jade Sea in Jade Sea Country but that was just an inner sea.</p>
 <p>“There is still a distance from here to the Southern Sea. If we ride a high-speed flying beast, it would take half a month.” Ye Guyan said after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared blankly, the Fire Bird that had broken through could be considered a high-speed flying beast that Ye Guyan mentioned. Even so, it would still require half a month. It looked like the Southern Sea City was quite far away from the Southern Sea.</p>
 <p>“That’s quite a distance away, looks like we can only go there in the future. Where are we go today then?” Qing Shui looked at Ye Guyan and asked.</p>
 <p>“I noticed that you are quite interested in the powers of Southern Sea City. I’ll bring you to feel the atmosphere.” Ye Guyan smiled gently.</p>
 <p>Martial God Street!</p>
 <p>This was a famous street in Southern Sea City and was also the widest street. Legend has it that a Martial God once originated from this place. As for what rank he was, no one knew. They only knew that he was very strong.</p>
 <p>There were many people staying on Martial God Street. Most of them were cultivators, strong cultivators at that. This was because the clans that stayed here were especially strong clans.</p>
 <p>After one hour, they had arrived. Qing Shui, Ye Guyan and Ye Yan stepped onto this special street. The street was paved with Blackrain Stones, making it look jet black, giving off solemn and serene feeling.</p>
 <p>There were many people on the street but there weren’t many stores or people selling goods. Qing Shui could feel that the people walking on the street on the whole had a decent cultivation. Of course, they were not all Martial Saints. No matter where it is, it was impossible to find a street filled with Martial Saints.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could see a few weapon shops, armor shops and even accessory shops. There were many types but they did not seem as messy as other big streets.</p>
 <p>The width of the street was 1000 meters and there were manors on both sides. Most of the buildings here were only nine stories tall but each floor was very high. Even the pavilions in the manors could be seen very clearly from the outside.</p>
 <p>The people staying here were not just rich, more importantly they were strong. Of course, not every clan here were like those supreme clans. The Ye Clan definitely had the qualifications to stay here, but it was unknown why they did not do so. Qing Shui felt that being able to stay along this street was considered a form of status.</p>
 <p>In the distance there were a few large dueling platforms. There were many people walking about on the plaforms, seeming very lively. Turning his head towards Ye Guyan, Qing Shui asked, “With Miss Ye and the Ye clan’s strength, staying here shouldn’t be a problem.”</p>
 <p>“Currently, the Ye clan does indeed qualify to stay here. Actually, there are many people who can stay here but they do not. On the other hand, there are many who are not qualified but are staying here.” Ye Guyan smiled lightly in Qing Shui’s direction.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood after he thought for a while. There was actually no need to fight for a space here. There were some who would be invited by others to stay, or given the best manor, even if they decided not to.</p>
 <p>As for those that weren’t qualified, they would think of ways to stay there. This way, they would not only raise their clan’s prestige, they could have more interactions with the strong clans. Therefore the benefits were huge.</p>
 <p>Hence, this was the place where people of great strength gathered because this way, they could interact with the greatest powers in Southern Sea City.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Guyan did not do that. She was the pillar of the Ye Clan and the glory of the Ye Clan was the result of her efforts. Thus, she had no need to do that.</p>
 <p>Actually, there was a manor that was left specifically for the Ye Clan, but the Ye Clan did not move in.</p>
 <p>“This street is famous because the Tantai Aristocratic Clan, Wuma Aristocratic Clan and Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan stay here.” Ye Guyan looked into the distance and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Oh, looks like there are more Aristocratic Clans here.” Qing Shui looked at Ye Guyan and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Basically every clan here is an Aristocratic Clan. This is the gathering ground of the strongest Aristocratic Clans. Even within the Southern Viewing Continent, the strength of this place is among the top.” Ye Guyan turned her head and smiled as she walked forward with Qing Shui and Ye Yan.</p>
 <p>Ye Yan stood quietly by Ye Guyan’s side, frequently looking at her surroundings. Occasionally, the people on the street would also look toward the three of them. After all, Ye Guyan was a supreme beauty, it was normal for her to attract some attention. However, as this was Martial God Street, there were less people watching them. The people here had complex backgrounds, thus even when they saw a beauty, not many would dare to be impudent.</p>
 <p>“Do you see that? That is the Wuma Aristocratic Clan. Actually, this can only be considered as a branch of the Wuma Aristocratic Clan. No one knows where the rest of them are.” Ye Guyan pointed to a grey manor and said.</p>
 <p>With one glance, Qing Shui felt that it was very strange. The grey building against black street made the manor feel gloomy. The other manors were white, green, red…… With the blue sky, they were comfortable to look at.</p>
 <p>“What a strangely colored building, it makes one to feel gloomy.” Qing Shui smiled.</p>
 <p>“The Wuma Clan research poisonous worms, also known as Witch Worms. It is said that the color of the building is one of the requirements for rearing them. You will notice that the nearest building is at least 100 meters away. This is due to the fear of the poisonous worms crawling over.” Ye Guyan smiled casually.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew that these worms were very precious and would not crawl over by accident. However, no matter who it was, they would be worried. Thus, the nearest pavilion with someone staying in it was at least 300 meters away. Those across the street were not afraid as the street was 1000 meters wide.</p>
 <p>“Who stays in front and behind of the Wuma Clan?”</p>
