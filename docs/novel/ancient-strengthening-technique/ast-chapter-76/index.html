 <p><strong>Chapter 76 Once again, taking advantage of Yu He.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>AST 0076 – Once again, taking advantage of Yu He </strong></p>
  <p><span style>Cultivating inside the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal before he was forced out, Qing Shui grumbled as he found himself back on the bed. After all, almost every time he entered the spatial realm, and up to the time the “entry time” ended, it would be late at night.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The second day, he awoke early, and made his way to the court yard.</span></p>
  <p><span style>From afar, Qing Shi had approached and greeted Qing Shui from a distance, as Qing Shui happily replied, “Good morning to you too!” All of a sudden, unknowingly, he somehow activated the Heavenly Eye Technique, and the inner organs and the mystical energy channels and meridians of Qing Shi were visible to him.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, he soon noticed that the drain on his energy reserves were even greater than the time when he had activated the Ancient Yin-Yang flames!</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, Qing Shui was pleasantly surprised, in the field of medicine, there were many sickness or diseases that could be diagnosed easily through methods such as pulse taking, and cured with prescription of the correct dosage of medicine.</span></p>
  <p><span style>However, there were many others such as internal injuries, or pre-existing illnesses such as cancer that were not so easily diagnosed until after the first wave of effects appeared.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“The Heavenly Vision Technique, is even more effective than x-rays from my previous world!” Qing Shui dumbly stood there. Before this, he was already awed by the Heavenly Vision Technique, but it was only now did he truly realize how powerful it actually was.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Earlier, when he glanced at Qing Shi, Qing Shui realized that many of Qing Shi’s energy channels were many times thinner when compared to his own, and the openings of Qing Shi’s energy channels were sealed, causing the flow of energy to be very weak or even stopped by the blockage. As for inner organs, and bone structure, Qing Shi appeared just slightly better than an ordinary human. Upon further contemplation, Qing Shui guessed that the factor behind the thinner than normal energy channels was probably the reason why Qing Shi’s combat ability was so low.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, what happened, why are you dumbstruck?!” Qing Shi gently shook Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, nothing, I just suddenly thought of something!” Qing Shui perfunctorily said. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Hehe, are you thinking about a woman?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Now that two young men were hanging out together, seeing as they had nothing to do, they would start to crack jokes about everything under the sun. Chatting left and right about who were the prettiest girls from which of the various clans, their looks, their figures, their mannerisms and all the way even to some downright lewd topics regarding the type of women they fancied and about their fantasies…</span></p>
  <p><span style>After their discussion, they commenced the daily morning cultivation practice, with Qing Shui guiding Qing Shi. Naturally, Qing Shui could not be bothered to practice himself. After all, with a treasure like the spatial realm, how could anyone still waste their time cultivating outside of it?</span></p>
  <p><span style>Soon after, both Qing Yi and Yuanying, called out to them, telling them that it was time to eat. From the aroma drifting towards them, Qing Shui could instantly tell that they had prepared the black fish for the breakfast.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Haha, seems like we would have the chance to eat something delicious for breakfast later!” Qing Shi happily exclaimed after their morning practice.</span></p>
  <p><span style>As Qing Shui was about to reply, he caught sight of someone entering the Qing Clan’s medical store, and that person was a ravishing beauty!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He!</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Yu He saw Qing Shui, her eyes flashed with brightness as she stuck out her tongue at Qing Shui. That adorable action of hers caused both Qing Shui and Qing Shi to be stunned, standing there like idiots. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Wha…What are you doing here?” Puzzlement shone in his eyes as Qing Shui questioned, after all, only 4-5 days had passed, prior to their 10 days agreement.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Oh, so you don’t welcome me!” Yu He pouted at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Nonononono, how can that be? You are always on my mind, a lady as gracious as you, it would always be my pleasure to welcome you! Only this visit is too sudden, catching me unawares.” Qing Shui quickly replied. It was true that the memory of him colliding with Yu He had always been hovering about in his mind.</span></p>
  <p><span style>That feeling, even when dreaming, Qing Shui would drool about it!</span></p>
  <p><span style>As the voices of their discussion rang out, Qing Yi and a few others, upon hearing Yu He’s voice, came out and invited her into the room. From his observations, Qing Shui knew that his mother and Yu He had quite a friendly relationship.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shui entered the room, the first thing he saw, were seven to eight piles of money lying on the table while three black lines appeared on his forehead. </span><i><span style>“Nooo, my money.”</span></i><span style> He failed to notice the look of hidden bitterness that Yu He shot him. When he finally calmed down, he could only grin sheepishly at Yu He. After all, it was him that proposed the limit of 10 fish per day.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was the only one feeling uncomfortable as they began dining, the table erupted with laughter as Yu He constantly flashed the thumb up gesture, complementing Qing Yi on her cooking.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Normally, Qing Shui would feel blissful to have such a beautiful lady eating breakfast with him, and most importantly, Yu He was the type of woman that Qing Shui loved. However, from his observations, he could tell that there was a deeper meaning behind Yu He’s sudden visit.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Sister Qing Yi, this fish is really delicious.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Pu!” Qing Shui accidentally choked on his food.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui strangely, why would Qing Shui suddenly have such a huge reaction. What was even more weird, why was Yu He suddenly calling her sister? Although their relationship was not bad, surely it hadn’t developed to the point of calling each other sisters yet.</span></p>
  <p><span style>While Yu He, was incomparably joyful, just by watching how Qing Shui ate, it already caused her to break into smiles. However, whenever their gazes met, Qing Yi would notice traces of happiness, fascination and even complexity in the eyes of Yu He.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When they finished the meal and Yu He was about to leave, she suddenly paused and look to Qing Shui before stating, “Qing Shui, how about sending me out, Aunty Yu wants to speak to you about a few things!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, noticing the signal Qing Yi was giving him, instantly nodded his head in agreement as he walked Yu He out.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What Confucius said was right, both women and despicable men are truly tough to handle!” Qing Shui mumbled under his breath as he walked towards Yu He.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“What are you mumbling about, I didn’t quite catch that.” Yu He</span></p>
  <p><span style>“I said that Aunty Yu’s charm soars all the way to the 9 heavens, and was wondering which lucky male would steal your heart away!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Little bonehead, why did you suddenly choke out loud during breakfast earlier, I’m very curious!” Yu He smiling asked as she looked to Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at Yu He, Qing Shui could not help but gulp as memory of their accidental collision surfaced, how attractive she was, how beautiful she was, this was all he could think about. He felt a sudden, extremely intense impulse to hug her.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Aunty Yu, I was wrong!” After which Qing Shui collapsed right into the middle of the deep valley between the twin peaks of Yu He, with his hands around her back, tight in an embrace. Naturally, he did not forget to take the chance to smell the fragrance of her body.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Yu He gasped, as she froze, even forgetting to push away Qing Shui who was blatantly eating her tofu.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t know when was it that he had acquired such balls, but since the deed was already done, he might as well enjoy it, right? Closing his eyes, he began to motorboat his head about left and right, in between the twin peaks of Yu He’s chest, when suddenly, he could feel two bud-like things erect as he was drowning in ecstasy. Without thinking, he gave in to instinct. Qing Shui opened his mouth and gently sucked on one of the pointed bud-like things through the thin layer of Yu He’s robe.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui had never experienced such a wonderful feeling before!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah!” Finally after she recovered, Yu He violently push Qing Shui away, her face flushed in anger while her eyes turned watery, it seemed as though she was about to break down and cry.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Y… you are bullying me!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Even though Yu He looked terrified and miserable, there were no hints of hysteria. Qing Shui felt that the Yu He now, felt strangely even more appealing. Without any traces of the air of a successful young entrepreneur, but was something more like a weak and gentle little woman who had suffered a lot through her life. </span></p>

 <p><span style>Looking at Yu He, Qing Shui could not help but gulp as memory of their accidental collision surfaced, how attractive she was, how beautiful she was, this was all he could think about. He felt a sudden, extremely intense impulse to hug her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aunty Yu, I was wrong!” After which Qing Shui collapsed right into the middle of the deep valley between the twin peaks of Yu He, with his hands around her back, tight in an embrace. Naturally, he did not forget to take the chance to smell the fragrance of her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He gasped, as she froze, even forgetting to push away Qing Shui who was blatantly eating her tofu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui didn’t know when was it that he had acquired such balls, but since the deed was already done, he might as well enjoy it, right? Closing his eyes, he began to motorboat his head about left and right, in between the twin peaks of Yu He’s chest, when suddenly, he could feel two bud-like things erect as he was drowning in ecstasy. Without thinking, he gave in to instinct. Qing Shui opened his mouth and gently sucked on one of the pointed bud-like things through the thin layer of Yu He’s robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui had never experienced such a wonderful feeling before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” Finally after she recovered, Yu He violently push Qing Shui away, her face flushed in anger while her eyes turned watery, it seemed as though she was about to break down and cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y… you are bullying me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Yu He looked terrified and miserable, there were no hints of hysteria. Qing Shui felt that the Yu He now, felt strangely even more appealing. Without any traces of the air of a successful young entrepreneur, but was something more like a weak and gentle little woman who had suffered a lot through her life. </span></p>
