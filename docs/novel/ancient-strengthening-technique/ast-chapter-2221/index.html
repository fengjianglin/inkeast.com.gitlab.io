 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2221 - Things Weren't Over Yet</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui was able to kill many people with the Nine Continents Mountain's collision strength of 30 billion dao force coupled with the Shield Attack after weakening them. This time around, Qing Shui had brought out most of his means. His prowess was very terrifying; many of the powerful Golden Yakshas were killed and the remainder thrown into a disarray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beihuang Fan and the others also joined in, taking the lives of many Golden Yakshas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui had no idea how many Golden Yakshas had come. Some of them fled, but there were over 1,000 of them who were killed. The Golden Yakshas they were up against were the strongest, especially the few older Golden Yakshas at the front. They were the brothers of the Ye Clan's head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone were very excited and shocked as they swept through the battlefield. Earlier on, Qing Shui had entered his peak condition and increased the strength of the people around him tremendously. Moreover, they also gained a great defense, which felt awesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opponents were greatly weakened. Qing Shui's Emperor’s Qi applied the weakening effect onto a small area and didn't have to weaken them one at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The same went for the Art of Pursuing. Although the Emperor's Qi could do this from a long time ago, the Art of Pursuing could be applied to an area more recently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui let the others clean up the battlefield while he returned to reinsert Qing Xiu's bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui currently felt as if he was like a surgeon. However, the people in his previous life wouldn't have been able to reach such a level. Qing Xiu's wounds were cut open once again, but Qing Shui had applied anaesthesia using the gold needles. Yiye Jiange watched by the side, her eyes red and her heart aching. At the thought of the pain her son felt when he had his bones removed, she couldn't hold back her tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other party wouldn't have applied anaesthesia like Qing Shui had done. The more she thought about it, the more upset she felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course Qing Shui felt upset as well, but he was a man. Moreover, Qing Xiu was doing very well and didn't make a sound. The kid was still young, but he knew he had to stay silent. If he were to make any sounds, his parents would feel worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui completed the treatment very quickly and then used the Force of Rebirth and the Life and Death Needles, hastening the recovery. He also used the Spring of Life. After all these were done, Qing Xiu wouldn't feel any pain even after the gold needles which were used to apply anaesthesia were removed. Moreover, he would be able to recover within a week.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Xiu fell asleep. Qing Shui pulled out the needles and turned to look at the tear-stricken Yiye Jiange. This woman hadn't cried before, but was now crying because of her son. Qing Shui hugged her gently, "Alright, don't cry anymore. Although the kid has endured rough situations, it's also a means of tempering him. Misfortunes could turn out to be blessings in disguise."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'd rather he not have such blessings," Yiye Jiange said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's been hard on you. You've always been the one to take care of him. I'm too irresponsible as a father," Qing Shui said bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You aren't allowed to say this. You're a great hero in his heart and he has always viewed you as his goal. I'm very happy that he's our child." Yiye Jiange hugged Qing Shui tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's all fine now. The kid is very strong and both his aptitude and talent are top notch. Moreover, he's very sensible," Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yiye Jiange looked at their son who was deep asleep and heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. Earlier on, her heart was torn at the thought of her son having two pieces of bones removed from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A lot of those people have been killed. This matter won't just end like this. I'll make the Ye Clan disappear." Qing Shui said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yiye Jiange sighed softly and said, "Don't kill the innocent."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui liked her kindness. He didn't wish to kill anyone innocent either, but he couldn't calm down the fury in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qing Shui came out, he noticed that the rest had gathered around. When Muyun Qingge saw Qing Shui appearing, she quickly asked, "How's Xiu`er?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's fine. He'll be back to normal in a few days' time," Qing Shui said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Muyun Qingge nodded happily, "I'll go take a look at Jiange."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, what's your plan?" Cong Yunlong asked, concerned. Right now, they knew that Qing Xiu was fine and all of them heaved a sigh of relief. If anything were to happen to Qing Xiu, they had no idea how crazy Qing Shui would become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Golden Yakshas are in an alliance with the Demon Gate and the Five Tiger Immortal Palace. We'll have a life or death battle eventually. Since the people from the Ye Clan are unable to control themselves, then I'll start with Ye Clan first." Qing Shui had decided to wipe out the Ye Clan. He wasn't sure if the other three clans in the Golden Yakshas would take action, but chances were high that they would. When he headed out to wipe out the Ye Clan, he might face all the Golden Yakshas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Yakshas' population was too great, reaching several billions in number. They were also considered a great clan in the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain with strong reproduction abilities. Therefore, there would be many decent experts amongst them. It was a little impractical for Qing Shui to be facing so many of them by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, there are too many experts amongst the Golden Yakshas. It's fine if it's on land, but there aren't many people who are able to wipe them out within a short period of time. Moreover, the Golden Yakshas have their powerful Guardian Beast. That creature is very strong and we're unable to enter the Golden Yakshas' core area," Cong Yunlong said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Qing Shui possibly not know about this? However, he was unable to calm down if some people in the Ye Clan weren't killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget it, Qing Shui. We've already killed so many people. Xiu`er is now fine. We mustn't be headstrong either. We'll see how it goes in the future." At this moment, Yiye Jiange walked out and said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui rubbed his head, "The Ye Clan will probably not take this lying down, therefore I'll stay here and await for their arrival. No matter how many of them come, I'll kill all of them. They'll definitely come."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yiye Jiange didn't say anymore. She knew that what Qing Shui said was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui saw that the surrounding formation was fine and told everyone that everything was fine and they could go back. It would be fine with just him around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one left. Seeing that they didn't leave, Qing Shui didn't urge them further. He felt that he was quite strong now, but it was a pity that the Flying Sword depleted too much power. Moreover, there was a restriction on the Stellar Transposition and he could only use it once every five minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Continents Mountain wasn't bad, but when encountering opponents that were too strong, it would still be stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people around him were quite strong and had the ability to kill as well. This was especially the case for Beihuang Fan, Cong Yunlong and the Hill Moving Battle God. Yiye Jiange could manage as well, but it was harder for the other ladies. After Qing Shui applied his formations on them and weakened the opponents, they would be able to kill, but not crush their opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Qing Shui feel that he didn't have enough strength backing him up. He only had &nbsp;powerful weakening abilities and had good controlling skills as well, but lacked a killer move to unleash a massacre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Slaying Beast was still decent, but it was harder to say this for the Dark Phoenix and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. After all, they weren't strong enough. The opponents that Qing Shui had encountered recently were too strong.</span></p>
