 <p><strong>AST 772 - The Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death Against Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan (2)</strong></p>
 <p>When used again cultivators of such a level, Qing Shui could easily push back his opponents. They say that in battle, if you take one step back, it'll be followed with many steps back thereafter. Moreover, although the powers of the Shield Attack would not be able to cause the opponent to be hit by dizziness, when it pushed back the opponent, the opponent's gathered powers would be scattered by half if not completely. It only took that one short moment.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui knew about this very long ago but he had been unable to find the right moment. Usually, during battle, he would also try to find a chance for this. For example, when Qing Shui hit out with the Shield Attack, he would also shoot out his needles at the same time.</p>
 <p>Shield Attack!</p>
 <p>After pushing back the elder with another Shield Attack, Qing Shui sent needles flying out from his sleeves, aiming for his forehead. That flash was like a devil's curse.</p>
 <p>It pierced through the head!</p>
 <p>Usually, this would be effective on the first use in every battle, catching people unaware. However, when he tried to attempt this a second time, people would either be on guard or try not to get near Qing Shui's Violet Gold Divine Shield.</p>
 <p>The Hidden Weapon Technique was extremely profound and caught people unaware. The essence to this technique was to be fast, accurate and vicious. It must be so fast that it was unbelievable, catching people unaware and so fast that one could only see it but not dodge it or even let their consciousness be able to catch up with what they saw. This was the crux of hidden weapons, only speed could counter it.</p>
 <p>Accuracy was something that was of absolute importance for hidden weapons. No matter how fast they were, if they didn't hit the opponents, they would be useless. Qing Shui had not expected that toward the end, hidden weapons could be used together with his spiritual sense which would bind down his opponents. It was just like the Meteor Smash. Moreover, with Qing Shui's ability, accuracy was not an issue.</p>
 <p>Viciousness can increase one's lethal damaging prowess. It was just like how Qing Shui had used stones to shoot demonic beasts' eyes to give them lethal damage. If he were to shoot elsewhere, it might not even be able to break through their thick hides and shells. Viciousness did not only refer to attacking the person's weaknesses. For example, the stones could be changed to hidden weapons which had been tempered with poison, or the Primordial Flame Balls, which were both very lethal.</p>
 <p>The old man's brain was penetrated, through the spot between the brows at that. He was struck by tremendous pain, his consciousness blurred out and Qing Shui's Thunder God quickly smashed down on his head, bursting it.</p>
 <p>First one down!</p>
 <p>Earlier, Qing Shui's attacks were like strong gales and thunderstorms. Moreover, with the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable helping Qing Shui, protecting his back from the old men who were trying to sneak up on him, this old man was instantly caught and killed unaware.</p>
 <p>When the old man's headless corpse dropped, the crowd went wild. Going up against five opponents and dashing forth with great arrogance, killing one of them with great perfection. He had controlled the time and speed with great perfection.</p>
 <p>"I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me. One person against five, with one of them instantly killed when the battle had not started for long. The power was too domineering, too strong."</p>
 <p>"This is too awesome! This kind of man is the kind that I'd like to have." A young and obese lady smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"With the likes of you? Aren't you scared to become a joke?" A young man said in disgust.</p>
 <p>"Who do you think you are? What's it to you who I like? With your useless look, even if you were to give me a mountain of gold, I wouldn't let you touch even a pinky of mine." The lady shouted out in a loud voice.</p>
 <p>Young man: "..."</p>
 <p>The people in the surroundings broke out laughing and that lady whose waist was like a bucket had her hands at her waist, "What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a beauty before?"</p>
 <p>The people in the surroundings gritted their teeth, rumbling sounds coming from their stomachs. One of them could not hold it in and ended up puking.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Kill!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui locked onto another person and quickly charged forth. In a battle, momentum is very important. When one person was up against multiple opponents, it was best to shuffle about and kill, instead of being surrounded by the opponents.</p>
 <p>Not everyone could take the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt's paralyzing effect. The increase given by the Thunder God which made one two times stronger wasn't the most terrifying. What was the most terrifying was the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt. Once one couldn't hold up against the paralyzing effect, what awaited was only death.</p>
 <p>There were many methods to counter paralyzing effects. If one's spirit energy was strong enough, one would be able to counter it. One could also rely on external objects. Usually, armors that were of a similar level with the Thunder God would have similar effects, just like that Jade-Armored Immortal Garb.</p>
 <p>Another option was some weird stones which had divine effects that could purify. Moreover, weapons that had paralyzing effects were something that one might not be able to create even if ten thousand people had tried it. And even if there were any, usually they would not be too powerful either. There was also the point about success rate. It was just like how the success rate of Qing Shui's Thunder God was far too low.</p>
 <p>The Thunder God's Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt was very powerful but it could not be used repeatedly. After each use, one must rest for some time. This was why each time around, it could reach the expected effect, unless the opponent had the ability to neutralize the effect of the Ten Thousand Great Thunderbolt.</p>
 <p>To go against paralyzing effects, there was a kind of Heaven Extinction metal which was suitable to be used for forging weapons. It was sharp, hard and could cut through all connections. It conducted neither heat nor poison and naturally could also be used so that paralyzing effects would not be conducted either.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, two of them died. Now, the commotion from the crowd was getting louder than before. Everyone could see the results of the fight. The remaining three from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan could not do anything to turn the tables and now, each of their faces had turned grim as they knew that they might be going to die today.</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable held one back while Qing Shui headed toward the other two.</p>
 <p>It was still alright for Qing Shui to handle these two people. Afterall, their abilities had been weakened by quite a lot.</p>
 <p>The remaining three old men knew that in order to survive, they must kill this young man before them. Now, there were still three of them. They couldn't afford for any more casualties, otherwise, there wouldn't be any more hope.</p>
 <p>Gritting his teeth, the old man with a long beard on the left glared. He slashed out toward Qing Shui's left rib with his huge chakrams which emitted a cold gleam. Another old man thrust his sword toward Qing Shui's neck.</p>
 <p>The explosive sounds in the air and the dark black slashes created all tremored strongly in the air.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn't dare to be careless either. He defended himself against the saber with his Violet Gold Divine Shield, while the Thunder God knocked off the other old man's longsword. He then swung out his Thunder God, unleashing the Total Annihilation and sent the opponent flying.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui might not be able to have an advantage if they were to just compare their strength alone. However, the hammer was considered a heavy weapon and between two people of similar level, heavy weapons had an advantage when competing in terms of power.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was waiting. He was waiting for the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable to kill the others.</p>
 <p>Squeak squeak!</p>
 <p>The Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable's speed was not something the old man could match. Holding a small shield and a longsword, he barely managed to fend off the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable's attacks. Having some slight leeway, Qing Shui didn't wish to waste too much time and shot out a Frosted Iron Ball toward the old man.</p>
 <p>The old man was immediately at risk, facing attacks from both his front and back. How could the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable give up on such an excellent opportunity? It dashed toward that astonished old man at the speed of lightning. However, everything was too late for him.</p>
 <p>Now, three out of the five of them had died. The battle could be seen as over. However, Qing Shui still intentionally dragged out the time, hoping that the people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan would not be too alarmed. He wanted them to be mistaken that the most dangerous one was the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui then killed the last two old men together with the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable. With the use of hidden weapons, Qing Shui made it a breeze for the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable to be able to defeat the opponent without any additional waste of energy, killing them by poison.</p>
 <p>All five of them died and Qing Shui landed on the arena!</p>
 <p>There was no way to throw in the towel for the Fight of the Ultimate Life and Death, unless the other party would agree to it. Otherwise, they could only fight to the bitter death until one side was completely wiped out. There were also no limits to the number of rounds until there were no more people from one side who would be participating.</p>
 <p>"That poison beast is too powerful. If I also had one like it, I'd be able to do anything I wished." A young man looked at Qing Shui's Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable and said jealously.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Young Master Tuoba, is there anyone from your family who would be able to fend off this Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable?" Qu Jiao asked Young Master Tuoba.</p>
 <p>"This Five Colored Poison Beast is definitely the strongest I have seen amongst all Five Colored Poison Beasts. It must have taken heavenly and earthly treasures before. The easiest way to tame a Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable is to feed it the Flower of Life and after taking it, its abilities will rise greatly. It will form a connection with the owner and the person who owns the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable would also start to develop stronger resistance to poison."</p>
 <p>After saying this Young Master Tuoba saw that Qu Jiao was still looking at him. He chuckled and said, "We're just doing it for fun in our clan but there're still some people who could fight against it."</p>
 <p>"That's true. Actually, what I wanted to ask is if you can fend this off." Qu Jiao smiled and said.</p>
 <p>"Me? If it was the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable in the past, I could handle it. But now, I can't." Young Master Tuoba smiled bitterly and said. Amongst the people of his age, to think that even though he deals with poison, he was no match for this person's poison beast. That feeling of defeat and grief caused one to feel agony beyond words.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>"Elder sister, uncle has won."</p>
 <p>"Mmm." Ye Huyan was also looking happily at the man who was standing upright on the arena. Holding the shield and hammer, together with Qing Shui's handsome demonic appearance, he exuded an inharmonious charm, giving one an astonished vision.</p>
 <p>Cang Wuya, Fei Wuji and Bai Gui were all in a daze. To think that he had killed all five who were all unsurpassable existences. Unknowingly, they realized that Qing Shui had also reached an unsurpassable level. Without Qing Shui, they would probably never be able to help the Old Ancestor fulfil his dying wish all their lives.</p>
 <p>The people from Ye Clan were also bursting with excitement, much more than the others in the crowd. A battle like this was hard to come by. This was very important for their cultivation as well. Moreover, Ye Clan and this young man were considered good friends and if he was to emerge victorious, Ye Clan's reputation and status would be brought to new heights once again.</p>
 <p>Unlike Ye Clan, Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan was now very gloomy, each of them having dark faces. The old man from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan slowly spoke out, "Cuiyong, you bring Yanshu and the others up."</p>
 <p>"Yes, Old Ancestor!"</p>
 <p>The five old men from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan flew toward the arena. After the five of them had stepped forth, there was clearly a gap amidst the tens of people from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan. None of those from the Eastern Palace Aristocrat Clan were not pained when they noticed this situation. Each of them held great pride for their clan since when it had became powerful, no matter where they went, people would hold them in high regard.</p>
 <p>After looking at these five old men, Qing Shui didn't say anything and immediately waved to call out the Diamond Gigantic Elephant. Theoretically, his opponents' abilities would get stronger and stronger but it was also possible for them to call out their strongest. It would be up to them to decide how to go about doing it.</p>
