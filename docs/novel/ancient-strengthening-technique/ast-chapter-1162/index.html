 <p><strong>AST 1162 - Tantai Xuan who Fled </strong></p>
 <p>Qing Shui had one of his hands on her breasts and his other reached over her delicate waist and groped her round, perky and beautiful rear. It was so round and soft, yet at the same time surprisingly elastic.</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>With the previous wild experience, things went especially smoothly this time. Qing Shui was tirelessly demanding as he changed all sorts of positions. Scenes that were capable of making one’s blood surge unfolded before him and he was also one of the creators.</p>
 <p>At the same time, these scenes also emerged before Tantai Xuan, who was in another pavilion. She didn’t expect to once again witness a similar scene to before. This made her so embarrassed that she wanted to look for a hole and crawl into. It made her flustered.</p>
 <p>She shut her eyes tightly and covered her ears while she sealed her spiritual sense. But all these were once again proven ineffective. Those scenes emerged before her again. It was as if she was in the same room as Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan right now.</p>
 <p>It was a very strange feeling. She decided that she might as well stop covering her ears and trying to seal her spiritual sense. She could even see herself in front of Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan.</p>
 <p>“Can’t both of you restrain yourselves for a bit....?” Tantai Xuan muttered to herself, yet it was also like she was expressing her true feelings out aloud.</p>
 <p>But everything suddenly changed. As the scene changed, the three of them appeared in the same space of consciousness, much like that pleasant dream among the sea of flowers where Qing Shui and Di Chen met. But the current scene made the three of them extremely embarrassed.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan had appeared in the consciousness, standing together with Tantai Xuan. The three of them could clearly see Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan, who were passionately intertwined with each other on the bed.</p>
 <p>Although Qing Shui was embarrassed, he didn’t seem too surprised. He had witnessed the intimate moments of himself and Qing Hanye before just like this too, only now with an extra audience, Tantai Xuan. This was enough to make one die of embarrassment.</p>
 <p>However, the three of them were not in control of their bodies right now. No one spoke and they didn’t know even if they could speak either. Furthermore, they couldn’t look away even if they didn’t want to watch the scenes unfolding before them on the bed. Their sense of hearing, sense of touch, vision and sense of smell were being amplified multiple times more than usual. The air was filled with an indescribable lasciviousness.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui now understood why Tantai Xuan didn’t want to live in the same pavilion. Yu Ruyan understood now too. She initially thought that Tantai Xuan had only heard something. But now it was clear to both Qing Shui and her now. Their previous indecent performance had been seen by someone…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was gloomy. Never mind if he had to watch himself and his woman indulging in the wild act. It didn’t really matter. However, it turned out that there was also a kingdom toppling beauty watching beside him. If it was a man, Qing Shui would definitely have slain him without any second thoughts…...</p>
 <p>The most mortified among them were still Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan, especially Yu Ruyan. There were no words to describe her current mood. Actually Tantai Xuan wasn’t feeling any better than Yu Ruyan. She had seen every inch of this man. On top of that, it was in this fashion. The most speechless part was the fact that she was watching it together with the very same man.</p>
 <p>Their intimate acts were no longer within their control. Right now, all the three of them could only watch the couple on the bed going at it untiringly.</p>
 <p>Perhaps due to their subconsciousness, it was a lot shorter this time compared to previous time. Even so, it still lasted for more than two hours. The scene before Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan’s eyes wavered and Tantai Xuan vanished while both of them seemed to have returned on top of the bed. However, when they were watching just now, their sensations didn’t disappear.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was still embracing Yu Ruyan but it was very quiet in the room. In the silence of this moment, they could hear each other’s hearts beating. The two of them were embracing, facing each other. He was looking at Yu Ruyan’s satisfied but mostly embarrassed expression on her face.</p>
 <p>“How could this happen……” Yu Ruyan sighed after a long moment.</p>
 <p>“This is telepathic communication between consciousnesses. The chance of it happening is only one in fifty thousand, one in one hundred thousand or even one in a million. The chance of it happening between three people is even lower.” Qing Shui was also very gloomy about it actually.</p>
 <p>He feared that this would traumatize Yu Ruyan and even him. He recalled last time and those exciting ‘scenes’ that he had watched earlier. No wonder why Tantai Xuan was acting strange last time.</p>
 <p>It turned out that they had been watched long ago!</p>
 <p>If both him and Yu Ruyan didn’t know the fact that she had seen it, they wouldn’t really feel anything. But now, they didn’t even know how to speak to each other normally the next time they met…...</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan was also extremely embarrassed. “Do you think Sister Xuan can still see us right now?” she asked cautiously.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“How can I face her after this……?” Yu Ruyan grew more ashamed the more she thought about it, to the extent that she wanted to look for a hole and crawl into. It turned out that Sister Xuan had already seen them last time. No wonder why she was asking her if she was very happy earlier and said that she was making such weird noises. So she had actually seen everything…...</p>
 <p>………..</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was in her bedroom. Her face was so red that it seemed like blood would seep out at any moment. Was there anything more embarrassing than this? Her thoughts were swirling in her head.</p>
 <p>The sky was growing brighter. She was a little afraid of the morning coming. She woke up really early but holed herself up in her room all this time!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui woke up and went for his morning practice. On the other hand, Yu Ruyan made her way towards Tantai Xuan’s room. Tantai Xuan jolted at the knock of her room’s door. She opened the door to find herself staring at Yu Ruyan. “Sister Ruyan!”</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan blushed. She held Tantai Xuan’s hand as she entered the room and closed the door behind them.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan, I would like to leave the Putuo Mountain,” Yu Ruyan said softly.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xuan was shocked. She clasped Yu Ruyan’s hand tightly. “Sister Ruyan, we are all women. Do you have to be like that? We’ve already discussed this, why do you want to make such a decision instead? Could it be that you don’t want to be my sister anymore?”</p>
 <p>“Sister Xuan, you won’t look at me in some other way?” Yu Ruyan asked helplessly. This was the most embarrassing part for her. Although men and women enjoyed sexual pleasure that was the most amazing thing in the world, this kind of intimacy should only be shared among two people. It would really be upsetting if it was seen by someone else.</p>
 <p>“Sister Ruyan, what are you saying? To be honest, I am quite envious of you. Did it really feel that good….?” Tantai Xuan blinked her eyes teasingly.</p>
 <p>“Oh I see, so even our holy maiden is also in heat now. Should I call him over?” Yu Ruyan blushed but she was a lot calmer now. This incident seemed to have brought the two ladies even closer together.</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about, Sister Ruyan? Listen, we are sisters forever. There’s nothing to be ashamed of between us. Why don’t we sneak away now? It’s awkward to see him……” Tantai Xuan huffed.</p>
 <p>“Sure! Use your Sacred Jade Divine Stone and wait for me a hundred li away from here. I’ll go and inform him first.” Yu Ruyan agreed after thinking for awhile and felt like it was a good thing to do too. This incident would be forgotten eventually.</p>
 <p>When Yu Ruyan went to inform Qing Shui, he was also a little gloomy. The two ladies had initially planned to stay here for two nights. Now, even Qing Shui didn’t feel like it anymore. He wasn’t worried about what Tantai Xuan would say, he was only worried if there would be any revulsion between the two ladies. As for the revulsion between him and Tantai Xuan, it would probably never be gone.</p>
 <p>“Ruyan, perhaps the next time both of you return here, I may not be around here anymore. Only maybe. So if I’m not here, then don’t worry. I will go look for you,” Qing Shui said after thinking for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Alright, please take care of yourself. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine at the Putuo Mountain!”</p>
 <p>“Give her these to consume. The more powerful she is, the more beneficial it is to her too!” Qing Shui passed Yu Ruyan a portion of the things that would be useful to Tantai Xuan and asked her to give them to her. Yu Ruyan’s safety would be more guaranteed with Tantai Xuan’s strength.</p>
 <p>Yu Ruyan and Tantai Xuan left, without even having their breakfast. Qing Shui was left having his breakfast alone, while sighing at this turn of events that was out of his control. The incident this time had indeed left him speechless. He wasn’t even in the mood to talk about it anymore.</p>
 <p>As soon as he was done with breakfast, he immediately set off to the Firecloud Blacksmith Store. With the increase in his strength, he found that it was no longer that cold here. By the time he arrived at the Firecloud Blacksmith Store, Yan Yangzhao was already there.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I am here to bid my farewell!” Yan Yangzhao announced happily after he saw Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“You’re leaving that soon!?” Qing Shui found himself in front of Yan Yangzhao already while speaking.</p>
 <p>“Some matters to settle back home, so they are rushing me to return. We are brothers, so I’m not going to thank you in helping me forge the sword!” Yan Yangzhao reached out to pat on Qing Shui’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“If we are brothers then there’s no need to be so courteous. Since you are leaving, let me give you some little presents. I believe you will find them to your liking!” Qing Shui handed over an Interspatial Silk Sachet to Yan Yangzao.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I can’t possibly accept this……”</p>
 <p>“It’s Plum Blossom Wine!” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangzhao’s hand that was initially pushing it away immediately grabbed it with lightning speed…….</p>
 <p>“Brother, are you really planning to stay here? Go to the inner city. I will help you out!” Yan Yangzhao frowned as he offered seriously.</p>
 <p>The Divine Weapon Street was declining anyway. This was not how it used be in the past. The Forging Grandmasters here were only left with their reputations. A few of them had already moved out from here to the inner city a few years ago. There were also generations of Forging Clans and they were much more famous than the ones in Divine Weapons Street.</p>
 <p>“I will definitely make my way to the inner city but not now. When that time comes, I will definitely trouble you, Brother.” Qing Shui gave Yan Yangzhao a smile.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t look for me when you are at the inner city, I won’t forgive you.” Yan Yangzhao patted Qing Shui’s shoulder with great force.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui nodded and smiled, while he gave Yan Yangzhao a pat too.</p>
 <p>With Yan Yangzhao’s departure, Qing Shui reverted back to his monotonous life, just like back in the day. Stone had been improving rapidly. Over this period of time, Qing Shui had let him consume quite a lot of medicinal pills along with Old Man Wang. The old man still had more than a hundred years of lifespan so Qing Shui taught him a cultivation art to preserve health. His constitution was already fixed, so he didn’t teach him the Thousand Hammer Technique.</p>
 <p>Stone was cultivating the Tiger Form and the Thousand Hammer Technique but only very minimally. He could be considered proficient now. As they said, the master could only lead one to the door, while cultivation would be up to each individual.</p>
 <p>Normally, Stone should be able to carry out self-cultivation. As for how far it could go, it would all depend on his own luck!</p>
 <p>Both Old Man Wang and Stone had drunk Plum Blossom Wine. Qing Shui had used it for their meridian cleansing. The benefits that they received were enough to last them a lifetime.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui couldn’t really leave now even if he wanted to, because the pair of grandfather and grandson weren’t really that safe. Hence, he was prepared to stay here for now and then think about how to deal with the matters here appropriately.</p>
 <p>The Firecloud Blacksmith Store had great reputation now. Many people would come to customize or buy weapons. Over this period of time, Qing Shui had been forging in the blacksmith store. Not only that, he would also forge in the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, so the items on the shelves were of much better quality than before.</p>
