 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, another two months passed by. On this day, Qing Shui decided to head to the North Sea and the depths of the Haohan Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having returned for about three months, it was considered neither long nor short. However, some other things had happened in these three months. For example, Hai Dongqing and Yu He had both gotten pregnant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Qing Shui very happy. Women with a strong cultivation level had a lower chance of getting pregnant. Qing Shui didn't feel much about this, he just thought that the chances of them getting pregnant were very low. The probability of pregnancy would be similar to the intercourse on a safe day in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The safe day wasn't absolutely foolproof and the experts in this world had a very long lifespan, so this was probably a kind of balance in the world as well. Many people would manage to get children after a very long period of time or in the latter half of their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only those with great wealth and power would be able to have many children. However, people had physical restrictions. For example, the few ancient sovereigns in Qing Shui's previous life led long lives. Therefore, there were also a lot of people who paid a lot of effort in ensuring their good health.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was happy, he had not been wasting any days throughout this time. Even so, Yu Ruyan, Di Chen, and Tantai Xuan didn't get pregnant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn't willing to see a situation like this, but there was no other way out. He bade goodbye to his family and rushed in the direction of the Demon Lord Palace. Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing were both waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past two months, the Phoenix God Organization had basically settled down. Qing Shui had gone there a few times and not only had he helped Shen Huang to get stronger, he also helped to clean her impurities, allowing both her cultivation and combat experience to increase a notch higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Huo Feng had received tremendous help from Qing Shui. Qing Shui gave Huo Feng the Phoenix Form and hadn't expected it to be especially suitable for her. Although Shen Huang was the Phoenix God Organization's Divine Seat and her name was Shen Huang, it was a pity that the martial arts she cultivated wasn't one that was related to phoenixes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shadow Phoenix Pavilion hadn't been wiped out but had been thoroughly surpassed by the Phoenix God Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their domination wasn't because of the newly rising strength of Shen Huang and the others. Shen Huang had already been very strong even before this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Phoenix God Organization could be considered as terrifying now, thanks to the Golden Phoenix Organization and the Fire Phoenix Organization which had merged together with them. The name of the newly merged Organization still remained as the Phoenix God Organization. In fact, they had used this name before they went their separate ways. It was only at a later time that the Golden Phoenix Organization and the Fire Phoenix Organization set up their own groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Feng didn't have a clear mind and thus, everything was handled by Jin Feng. Nonetheless, now that he had recovered, Huo Feng was their representative. Right now, all their powers had merged together and it was all thanks to Shen Huang's charm. A lady who was like a goddess, she had a powerful ability to build cohesion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also let Qing Shui see, that the Dancing Phoenix Continent had the ability to match up with the Soaring Dragon Continent and the Haohan Continent. This feeling was very strong and this lady had contributed a lot to this Organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days ago, Qing Shui had already told Soulsearch that he was going to leave. He didn't say which day he would leave, but it would be in the next few days. When Qing Shui left, he didn't wish to tell anyone. Even Soulsearch, Puyang Qing, and the others didn't know either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Ming and Yiye Jiange, who was carrying Qing Xiu, stood on Dark Phoenix's back and flew at a rapid speed to the Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Yiye Jiange who was carrying their child, Qing Shui didn't know if this kid had a good life or not...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, during this period of time, Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing had also gone to the Qing Clan a few times. The members of the Qing Clan understood what this meant. It didn't matter if they weren’t Qing Shui's women now, but in the future, they would definitely be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They arrived at the Demon Lord Palace. Yiye Jiange still had an especially good relationship with the two ladies. Even Tantai Lingyan, who seldom showed any expression, revealed a faint smile. She smiled a lot more than before but seldom before outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, those who were familiar with her were already used to this. Most people would tend to lose their souls by seeing her smile. It was something which couldn't be bought even with a thousand gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Qing Shui enjoyed the most was to see Tantai Lingyan carrying children. It might be due to a woman's nature that she was able to do it so naturally. Right now, she carried Qing Xiu very naturally. That scene was very beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The kid wasn't shy and reached out his small and plump hand to touch Tantai Lingyan's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mmm mmm, don't be randomly touching..." said Qing Shui playfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's face flushed up and she glared at Qing Shui. Both Yiye Jiange and Qin Qing chuckled as they looked toward Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was only trying to get her to smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yiye Jiange also blushed a little. She recalled some events where she didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Sometimes, he would jokingly fight with the little kid for food...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qin Qing saw Yiye Jiange's expression, she whispered something next to her ears. This caused Yiye Jiange to blush even more. It was because back then, Qin Qing had been at the Qing Clan and saw the scene, but Qing Shui didn't seem to feel anything about it and even sucked out noisily in exaggeration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Till now, both Yiye Jiange and Qin Qing didn't know that Qing Shui had done it intentionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiye Jiange felt a little embarrassed at the thought of it while Qin Qing's heartbeat increased when she recalled the scene of Qing Shui kissing the snow-white peaks. She could still remember the slightly teasing gaze that Qing Shui cast at her back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three ladies in the room turned red. All of them were like fairies who had come down to the mortal world. Qing Shui looked at them seriously and the satisfaction in his heart was gushing like an overflowing river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still early and the two ladies didn't have anything to pack. Therefore, after informing Hua Rumei, Zhan Yu, and the others, the group went on their way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Lord Palace was still the Demon Lord Palace, but the Demon Lord Palace now had a different feel to it. Thanks to Hua Rumei, the one who had been managing the Demon Lord Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Tantai Lingyan seemed to be seeking development in the Haohan Continent. Although she didn't say anything, Qing Shui knew that she hadn't forgotten about the Five Tiger Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui didn't think to give up on it either. If the problem with the Five Tiger Immortal Sect persisted, the shadows in Tantai Lingyan's heart wouldn't be completely removed. Qing Shui hadn't brought these up, but he had not forgotten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current cultivation level, he had also tried to find out more about the Haohan Continent. However, he didn't get any pieces of information concerning the Five Tiger Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the ordinary world, those without a reputation were either not famous or without capabilities. However, if one didn't hear of them in the Haohan Continent, it would be because their level wasn't high enough to reach them. They might not even be able to reach the existences which were one notch lower than the Five Tiger Immortal Sect.</span></p>

All life forms within this area would be brought along with him.</span></p>

Moreover, an area of four meters square wasn't that small, with a length and breadth of two meters respectively, there was no problem for even ten people to fit in the space if they stood close together.</span></p>
