 <p><strong>AST 644 - Completing Di Chen's Wish (1)</strong></p>
 <p>Overnight, news about the Di Clan had spread rapidly in Seven Stars Country. Old man Ba was from "Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda". Anyone with some status in Seven Stars City would know that, back then, not many people knew about the battle situation. After all, Old man Ba's whereabouts were not kept a secret and meddlesome people would all have watched from afar.</p>
 <p>This battle made them understand that Old man Ba was very strong. With him in the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord, they would be able to remain as one of the seven stars. It was also through this battle that the Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda, which had always been keeping a low profile, was once again viewed in high regards by others.</p>
 <p>Many people held that suspicions over how many people there were in the Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda, Old man Ba's cultivation level, as well as whether Seven Stars Cloudway Pagoda would step out to fight for a position as one of the seven stars or to try to get into some circles.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui came out from the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal, it was already late in the morning and after having his meal, it was already close to noon. Therefore, most of them did not take their lunch. However, Di Clan still got people to send food over. It was just that Qing Shui had remained in his room and not come out.</p>
 <p>While in Di Clan, Qing Shui had entered the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal from the guest room. It was not far from the room he stayed in with Di Chen. He did not stay in Di Clan for the past two nights and was not sure if Di Chen was in Di Qing's room or in the room Di Clan had arranged for the two of them.</p>
 <p>Opening the room's door, he saw that Di Chen was standing at the window, staring outside. She turned to look at Qing Shui when she heard noise. Her beautiful face wore a faint smile but Qing Shui could still see that it was a smile that was put on when she turned. It was because her slightly furrowed brows had not relaxed yet.</p>
 <p>"Have you had a good rest?" Di Chen smiled gently.</p>
 <p>"Mmm, what are you thinking about?" Qing Shui walked up to Di Chen and stood next to her by the window and looked out.</p>
 <p>The view here was very good and allowed them to see a long distance away. They were even able to see the main streets in Seven Stars City, allowing them to look down on the world out there with all sorts of people.</p>
 <p>It felt wonderful to be able to look far away from a high position, looking down on everything down below. In fact, everyone hoped to be able to look downwards on other things and people, since it did not feel good to be lifting one’s head to look up, especially the mental state that accompanied it.</p>
 <p>"I'm baffled now. Suddenly, I don't know what I should be doing. In the past, I hated this place. But now, I discover that this place is not as hateful as what I imagined it to be. I'm scared." Di Chen said in a stupor.</p>
 <p>This was not strange. Di Chen had previously been hung up on the fact that her father had sent her to the Residence of the Sky Tyrant Lord. Now that she found out the reason behind it, although she still did not feel good about it, it was something she could accept. Moreover, she had also found out what her father had done for her all these years. Her father had not forgotten her. In these few days that they had been at Di Clan, other than Di Jing and his people, the rest had treated her quite well. This was especially so for Di Xuan's people, the people closest to Di Chen in terms of blood ties. That warmth they showered her with had affected her a lot.</p>
 <p>Di Qing, her father Di Xuan, the eldest brother, Di Fentian, who had doted on her since she was young, and Di Qing's mother who had treated her like her own, likely because her age was very close to Di Qing's. Moreover, Di Xuan only had these two daughters, and thus had doted on the two on them more so than he did the boys.</p>
 <p>It was not like Di Chen did not experience kinship before, so she knew about it. In fact, for all these years, she had not been able to let this go. Otherwise, she would not have thought to come to Seven Stars Country.</p>
 <p>"This is very normal. Relationship is the one thing that's most important in life. Be it kinship, friendship, or love, everyone needs to be supported by relationships. One would be able to live on properly with any one of them, living a good life. If it was a lonely person, a person without any 'relationships', then the person would be like a walking corpse or a devil."</p>
 <p>Di Chen smiled and looked at Qing Shui. Hearing Qing Shui's words seemed to make her feel slightly better. After all, so many years had passed. She knew well what she should do after everything had ended. She was just suppressed by that slight hint of pride.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, to you, out of kinship, friendship and love, which one do you think is the most important?" Di Chen asked, showing great interest.</p>
 <p>"A person who does not think much of kinship would not treat friendship and love seriously." Qing Shui smiled as he looked outside.</p>
 <p>"Why would you say that?" Di Chen smiled and look at Qing Shui, her beautiful eyes filled with warm smiles.</p>
 <p>"Everyone was born with kinship. Only those who values kinship would treat themselves and their kin well. Friendships are formed from building and developing connections with other people. Only the greatest friendship would be like kinship. As for love, it is also actually kinship. When a man and a woman fall in love, as time passes, it would become kinship. Only a kinship-like love would allow the couple to spend their whole lives together. Their children would be the product of their love, the ribbon that ties their hearts together." Qing Shui said slowly, his gaze turning increasingly soft. These were the things he had seen as well as added in with his own interpretations.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, am I unfilial?" Di Chen turned to look at Qing Shui and asked.</p>
 <p>"No. It's the parents' duty to bring up their children, just like how it is the children's duty to be filial to their parents. In both situations, they are voluntary acts, things that they do willingly. Even beasts do this. This is an instinct. Chen`er, your case is very special. After all, there are many things that are not within our control. Therefore, they cannot just live for themselves nor can they just think about themselves." Qing Shui's words were spoken from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>"Qing Shui, do you think that I can blend into Di Clan?" Di Chen felt very complicated when she said this.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood Di Chen's feelings. In fact, she had her own thoughts, but just wanted to receive the view of the person she cared about the most. Now, this person should be him. After all, Di Qing was also from Di Clan and the next person she was closest to should be himself. Although Qing Shui and Di Chen had not gone through the final act, sex, to become official husband and wife,they had both accepted this relationship. To a lady like Di Chen, occasional intimate acts were the best evidence of this.</p>
 <p>"The misunderstandings have been cleared up. They do love you but they had been left with no choice. This is what kinship is. If they did not love you, they would have definitely pushed you out. However, when faced with a life-and-death choice, they continued with their decision. This is the power of love." Qing Shui turned with a smile and said. Their faces were very close to each other and they could smell each other's breath.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!" Di Chen smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui planted a sudden peck on Di Chen's lips, "If you say thank you again, I'll smack your butt."</p>
 <p>Di Chen blushed as she said to Qing Shui in slight annoyance, "You're getting more and more out of hand. You're not allowed to be such a punk."</p>
 <p>"Do you want to try saying it again?" Qing Shui was relinquishing that wonderful feeling as he looked at Di Chen teasingly and smiled. Now, he was no longer that restrained when appearing before Di Chen.</p>
 <p>"I refuse to say it. You've turned bad!" Di Chen pinched Qing Shui's face and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"I want to hug you!"</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at this lady of unrivalled beauty. Her every twinkle and smile caused Qing Shui to be intoxicated. He licked his lips and that clear sound of him gulping could be heard. It may be he was trying to hide his embarrassment after saying this because Qing Shui had already wrapped his hands gently around Di Chen's waist.</p>
 <p>Di Chen had on a faint smile and a slight blush, laughing out softly next to Qing Shui's ear. Her voice was like that of a fairy singing, exuding a fatal charm.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Qing Shui heard her laughing like this. She seldom laughed out loud and would merely smile. In this moment, the sound of her laughter made Qing Shui feel as if he had drunk the finest wine, it felt extremely delightful.</p>
 <p>Just then, the door opened. Di Qing walked in to see Qing Shui and Di Chen in an embrace.</p>
 <p>Seeing Di Qing walking in, Di Chen anxiously pushed Qing Shui away, the blush returning to her face.</p>
 <p>"Ahh... I've disturbed you. Don't you know that you should lock the doors when you're doing intimate acts?" Di Qing smiled as she looked at Di Chen and Qing Shui, saying.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Qing Shui and Di Chen had separated, Di Qing did not walk out but looked at Qing Shui with great interest. It was because Di Chen was so embarrassed that she refused to look at Di Qing.</p>
 <p>"You didn't disturb us. But you really know how to pick your time to drop by..." Qing Shui said gloomily.</p>
 <p>"What rubbish are you spouting..." Di Chen pounded Qing Shui softly before walking over to Di Qing.</p>
 <p>Di Qing smiled happily, another emotion added in her eyes. It was an expression of struggle. When she looked at Qing Shui, sometimes she would fall into a daze. Qing Shui did not think much about it. Moreover, this was not the first time that she had fallen into a daze after seeing him. He merely thought that Di Qing was trying to think of new ways to tease him.</p>
 <p>"Elder sister, how does it feel?" Di Qing took Di Chen's hand and said, smiling.</p>
 <p>"What does what feels like?" Di Chen was stumped, not able to react.</p>
 <p>"The feeling of hugging a guy!"</p>
 <p>"If you want to know, go try it out for yourself!" Di Chen said.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, this is what you say, but if I were to really try it out, Elder Sister will definitely fight it out with me." Di Qing continued to say teasingly as she looked at Di Chen's expression without blinking.</p>
 <p>"Haha, if you like, then just go ahead. It'll be good if you can take his heart for yourself. This way, we two sisters would not have to be separated." Di Chen said teasingly to Di Qing, making it hard for one to tell if she was speaking the truth.</p>
 <p>"I don't care for that. This husband of yours is truly a playboy, having so many beauties by his side. I want to look for a man who would treat me like a treasure." Di Qing's tone changed very quickly.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was confused as he saw this scene. However, he knew that it was best that he say nothing at all, or he could choose to leave. When he looked at this pair of sisters who both had appeared in the Portraits of Beauty, he felt especially refreshed. The feeling was so beautiful that Qing Shui felt as if he was cleansing his soul.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had dinner with the two ladies as well as the members of Di Clan. However, there were only people from Di Xuan's side and there were not many of them, just over ten of them. It was much quieter than how it was previously.</p>
 <p>In fact, Di Xuan had his heart weighed down during the meal. He knew that if his daughter chose not to forgive him, this would be their farewell meal.</p>
 <p>"Aunt, have some of this!"</p>
 <p>"Aunt, have some soup!"</p>
 <p>Di Xian and Di Yao, the two juniors, kept passing the dishes to Di Chen.</p>
 <p>Di Fentian, Di Fenxing and the other members of Di Clan did not say a word. They merely cast gazes filled with complicated feelings as well as feelings of concern at Di Chen.</p>
