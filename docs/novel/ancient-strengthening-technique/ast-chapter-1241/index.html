 <p><strong>AST 1241 - One Spear Breaking Spirit, Meteor Rush, the old man in purple lion gown</strong></p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant already had the upper hand in terms of speed. This made Qing Shui really happy, the reason being that with speed, he would be able to attack and defend as he wished. In comparison, he would have much more space to move about flexibly.</p>
 <p>Real combat helped toughen up someone. Qing Shui operated his high grade spirit energy up to its peak.</p>
 <p>State of One with Elephant!</p>
 <p>Charge!</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant constantly rushed towards Saint Child. The weird energy from Saint Child once again rushed into both the dragon elephant’s and Qing Shui’s meridians. However, it was dissolved very quickly.</p>
 <p>Area Dominance!</p>
 <p>A white light enveloped Qing Shui, defending against every negative effect occurring within his body. Of course, it would have been hard to say if there were more attacks being dealt to the defense. Upon using Area Dominance, Qing Shui felt a lot more comfortable.</p>
 <p>Diamond Sword Qi!</p>
 <p>Previously, Saint Child’s body was also similarly shining with white light. Other than the Emperor’s Qi, the other negative effects had actually been removed, leaving Qing Shui with no choice but to once again make the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant patch it back.</p>
 <p>Vahra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Without all of these weakening abilities, Qing Shui felt that it was very likely that he would have been defeated very quickly.</p>
 <p>Saint Child remained calm and collected. However, the more he fought, the more fearful he felt. He felt that both the opponent and his demonic beast’s movements were becoming more and more coordinated. It was as if they were a single entity.</p>
 <p>But now, he had already come up with a countermeasure for it. He calmly blocked his opponents attacks. Countering skills with force, for now, he was still able to manage barely.</p>
 <p>At the moment when both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant once again used the Ferocious Dragon Elephant Attack, Saint Child also charged in.</p>
 <p>In mid-air, the body of Saint Child once again shone with the white light which Qing Shui was familiar with. Both his speed and strength abruptly shot up.The enormous javelin in his hand exploded with a resplendent white light.</p>
 <p>Battle Spirit Strike!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got frightened. He watched as the enormous javelin approached him and knew that he was already no longer able to dodge in time. Even if the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was to use the Instantaneous Diamond Evasion, it would also be futile, the reason being that he had already been locked onto by Saint Child’s Spiritual Sense.</p>
 <p>Divinity Protection!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui abruptly unleashed the Sword of Seventh Heavenly Wave with his Big Dipper Sword.</p>
 <p>Bang-bang-bang!</p>
 <p>Continuously exploding noises came through. Both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant got blown backwards. As if Saint Child would give up on such a good opportunity. He quickly charged in once again.</p>
 <p>Meteor Rush!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui swung his head, the Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel Bead which he had prepared a long time ago immediately got tossed out of his hands.</p>
 <p>Demon Binding Rope!</p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui only wanted to keep him occupied. Simultaneously, he also made the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant use the Vajra Subdues Demon and Diamond Sword Qi. With the Emperor’s Qi being the only exception, both the tyrannical Vajra Subdues Demon and the Diamond Sword Qi could only stay in effect for roughly five minutes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui suppressed fluctuation within his mind. If not for the Divinity Protection from before, it was very likely that he would have suffered a heavy injury by now. The more Qing Shui engaged himself in battles, the more he felt that the opponent wasn’t as terrifying as he thought. But despite so, he knew that he was actually relying on the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, without it, the only thing he could do was to run away.</p>
 <p>Thunderous Beast!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui took advantage of the time while his opponent was occupied and summoned the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant had very formidable resistance to physical attacks. In terms of his resistance to spirit energy, Qing Shui’s resistance to it was even more undisputable. Hence, he would stand a chance once the Thunderous Beast came out.</p>
 <p>After the Thunderous Beast attacked a number of times, Saint Child’s expression changed. He dodged away from Qing Shui and was about to charge towards the Thunderous Beast. He was aware that he had to eliminate this demonic beast or else he would die at its hands today.</p>
 <p>He had formidable spiritual sense. Even though the Thunderous Beast caused little to no damage to him, he was able to sense the terrifyingness about the demonic beast. This was very similar to cooking a frog in warm water.</p>
 <p>(TL note: it means due to a common situation which people are adapted to, they tend to let down their guard which results costing them their very lives.)</p>
 <p>As if Qing Shui would let him do as he pleased. He blocked Saint Child’s path with Instantaneous Diamond Evasion and once again smashed the Seal of Xuantian at his opponent. It had a 100% accuracy and was unavoidable.</p>
 <p>Earth mountain!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Disappear!</p>
 <p>Bloodthirsty Demonic Vines!</p>
 <p>While constantly attacking with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, Qing Shui was also continuously making a bit of trouble for Saint Child. He was doing this all to buy some time for the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>Now, Saint Child was feeling really annoyed. He was supposed to be a lot stronger than this little brat, yet he was left constantly occupied by him and was unable to get himself away from him. Since the incident from before, Qing Shui wouldn't forget to cast the Diamond Sword Qi as well as Vajra Subdues Demon from time to time to basically maintain his strength around that level.</p>
 <p>Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Mighty Dragon Elephant Stomp really worriedSaint Child. He felt that this area attack was very dangerous. Hence, normally, he would try to avoid it as much as possible. Halfway through, he failed to avoid it a number of times which as a result, caused his body to feel stiff. This really shocked him.</p>
 <p>Saint Child was once again trapped. He immediately stepped back and swung his hand. As he did so, a large demonic beast appeared beside him.</p>
 <p>Jade Kirin Beast!</p>
 <p>Its entire body was dark green like jade and it looked like a lion. It was about a hundred meters long. But compared to the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, it was considerably smaller. As soon as it came out, it was already charging in towards the Thunderous Beast.</p>
 <p>In the instant the Saint Child summoned his own demonic beast, Qing Shui unleashed the weakening abilities along with the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Vajra Subdues Demon!</p>
 <p>Emperor’s Qi!</p>
 <p>This still wasn’t enough, Qing Shui instantly took out the Soulshaking Bell and violently shook it.</p>
 <p>All of this happened within a few moments time. Qing Shui could feel that this demonic beast was slightly weaker than the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. It should more or else be around 8 million nimbus. It was also a mutated beast. Compared to the Fire Kirin Beast, it was much rarer.</p>
 <p>After being constantly weakened as well as threatened by the Soulshake Bell. The battle prowess of the Jade Kirin Beast was significantly reduced.</p>
 <p>Seven-headed Demonic Spider!</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, Qing Shui summoned the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider. On top of the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider, a small figure could also be seen. It was the Ten Thousand Poisonous Violet Sable.</p>
 <p>With the Heaven Shaking Drum and Spirit Gathering Lamp, Qing Shui didn’t feel panicked. He could have crippled the opponent’s Jade Kirin Beast whenever he wanted.</p>
 <p>The Jade Kirin Beast wore thick jade armor on its body. Both its resistance towards spirit energy and physical attacks were very powerful. Legend has it that it carried a hint of the true Jade Kirin Bloodline within its body.</p>
 <p>Under the effect of the Heaven Shaking Drum and Spirit Gathering Lamp, the spider web of the Seven Headed Demonic Spider managed to achieve a strength worth two million nimbus and more. The Demonic Spider Golden Armor could help make its stickiness and toughness as well as its toxicity increased three fold. Hence within a few moments, the Jade Kirin Beast was trapped by the Seven-headed Demonic Spider.</p>
 <p>But very quickly, a layer of faint dark green colored gas could be seen emerging from the Jade Kirin Beast’s body. It was just like water as it slowly corroded the spider web and caused it to deteriorate.</p>
 <p>The Jade Kirin Beast was a nemesis to all poisonous beasts!</p>
 <p>Even though the Jade Kirin Beast managed to restrain the Seven-Headed Demonic Spider, the spider itself was no ordinary demonic beast. The restraining effect also went both ways. The only thing seen was that its golden head started to give off a bright golden light. Not only that, the spider web it formed also started to give off a faint golden light.</p>
 <p>Spider Thread Bind!</p>
 <p>After that, yet another huge web appeared.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast was still constantly unleashing Thunderbolt at Saint Child.</p>
 <p>The ability of the Seven-headed Demonic Spider also shocked Qing Shui. It was actually able to keep the Jade Kirin Beast occupied. The Seven-headed Demonic Spider had really high intelligence. Even though the Jade Kirin Beast had been weakened quite significantly, Qing Shui thought that he would still need both the Thunderous Beast and the Seven-headed Demonic Spider in order to keep it occupied.</p>
 <p>The attacks of the Jade Kirin Beast mainly focused around its jade fire. This kind of flame was quite terrifying. Considering the fact that the Seven Headed Demonic Spider was slightly water-elemental in nature, it was still able to barely resist the jade flame attacks. In any case, it was still considered to have completely distracted the Jade Kirin Beast.</p>
 <p>“Just admit defeat. Or else I’m scared that I might end up killing you by accident,” Qing Shui said in his usual gentle tone.</p>
 <p>Even though he wasn’t loud, the people below were still able to hear him.</p>
 <p>“Darn it, how did things turn out like this? Saint Child is actually not a match against his brat,” someone screamed in surprise.</p>
 <p>“That brat isn’t a match against him. He is just showing off with his demonic beast.”</p>
 <p>“It’s still his skills to be able to show off with his demonic beast. Could you have done the same?”</p>
 <p>“Never would i have expected things to turn out like this. Saint Child is someone unbeatable, he definitely still have some tricks up his sleeves.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The discussions below were already unstoppable.</p>
 <p>Similarly, the Eldest Princess also found what she saw hard to believe. Even though she seemed the same on the outside, a huge wave arose deep within her. To her surprise, this little man was actually this strong. He was really capable of fighting against the Saint Child. In fact, he seemed to even have the upper hand now.</p>
 <p>Both Yan Jinyu and Seventh Princess were also really shocked. From the nervousness they felt at the beginning to the surprise and shock later on. Nevertheless, they would look at Eldest Princess from time to time. The reason being that considering that Eldest Princess was able to hug a man, it definitely wouldn’t be as she had explained before. Did she really like Qing Shui?</p>
 <p>“Do you really think you can beat me?” Saint Child observed Qing Shui’s face that had looked really calm, all along.</p>
 <p>“Try it then!”</p>
 <p>When Qing Shui finished speaking, he summoned the Thunderous Beast and made it use the Violet Lightning Strike.</p>
 <p>One Spear Breaking Spirit!</p>
 <p>A snow white spear afterimage or rather, the afterimage of a battle technique, charged towards Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Meteor Rush!</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui looked at the afterimage of the spear which was approaching him, he realized that he was unable to move. There was a weird energy locking him down. It wasn’t spirit energy locking him…… It was targeted through his soul. It felt really weird. On top of that, the power emitted from the snow white spear afterimage was really frightening.</p>
 <p>Sacred Jade Divine Stone Ring!</p>
 <p>He succeeded in a tiny movement after a struggle…… Qing Shui’s body actually moved. However, the spear afterimage was like a shadow following the body. It didn’t actually change just because he avoided it, so much so that its very distance also stayed the same.</p>
 <p>This was considered pursuing one’s spirit…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body couldn’t move any more. The only thing that could move now was his mind.</p>
 <p>Saint Child saw that Qing Shui was still able to move. Even though he was shocked, he was still more confident in his own battle techniques. This technique was a killing technique when used against someone with strength like Qing Shui’s. Previously, he was being too careless, he should have used it long ago.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>For safety purposes, Qing Shui told the Thunderous Beast to once again cast the Violet Lightning Strike. Since his life was also in danger, then Saint Child would also have to die.</p>
 <p>Saint Child was also feeling terrified deep in his heart. He couldn’t move and yet the fatal Ten Thousand Years Coldsteel Bead was heading towards his eyes. This was definitely fatal.</p>
 <p>To think that the demonic beast still had tricks up its sleeves!</p>
 <p>Everyone below the arena froze in shock. Could it be that they were planning to die together?</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“Daddy!”</p>
 <p>“Saint Child!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Right at this moment when everything seemed to be irreversible, both Qing Shui and Saint Child’s bodies moved. Furthermore, two soft but clear noises came through. As that happened, the surroundings turned formless. Everything quieted down.</p>
 <p>Both Qing Shui and Saint Child had walked past the gates of hell. At this moment, an old man in a purple lion gown appeared in the middle of the arena. He wasn’t talking, yet he was laughing loudly.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, you both are geniuses born from heaven. Furthermore, both of you are also from Heaven Secrets Academy, what’s the point in battling each other to the death? Today, let me be the mediator. Speak out about what kind of grudges you two hold for each other. I’ll see how we can solve it.” The old man’s voice sounded just like a clock. It felt as if his voice immediately rang within everyone’s ears.</p>
 <p>“This is Headmaster Cao!</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it’s said that he is really powerful!”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense! The terrifying attacks from before were dissolved by him effortlessly. How could he not be strong?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Fu Yantian greets Headmaster Cao!”</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui greets Headmaster Cao!”</p>
 <p>Even though Qing Shui didn’t know who this old man was but he still went along with Saint Child and greeted him.</p>
 <p>“Alright alright, come on, we will settle the problems between you two here and try to make you both as satisfied as possible.” The old man seemed particularly happy.</p>
