 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AST 2404 - Heartmatched Fruit, News of Tantai Lingyan</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, it had been three days since Qing Shui arrived at the Forsaken Heaven City. He planned to stay here temporarily and had inquired widely about the situation in the Forsaken Heaven City. The Forsaken Heaven City was different from other places since they could meet people who came from the Upper Three Regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other places, even in an existence like Zhongyuan City, there wouldn’t be any individuals or influences from the Upper Three Regions. At the very least, it’d appear as if there weren’t any.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Divine Palace and Demon Gate were present in the Forsaken Heaven City, and they were extremely powerful, among the top influences here. Another shocking piece of news that Qing Shui obtained was that it was very likely for Tantai Lingyan to be there. It was because the Demon Gate branches had been merged recently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be able to merge an organization like the Demon Gate in a place the Forsaken Heaven City, Qing Shui was basically certain that Tantai Lingyan had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wanted to look for Tantai Lingyan immediately. He had the confidence in defeating anyone in the Forsaken Heaven City. Of course, he wasn't planning to kill Tantai Lingyan. That woman had become very distant and Qing Shui wasn't sure if he would be able to help her recall her memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was extremely cold now, but she was very kind in the past. It was just that she was no longer the person she used to be. The demonic nature in her body had caused her to undergo changes. The Demon Saint Blood was extremely dominating and Qing Shui wasn't sure how he could negate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui took out the Heartmatched Fruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were two bright red fruits that were glistening and tender. Qing Shui had kept them all this while. He had gotten these fruits in the past and he felt that he would never use them in this lifetime. It was because he didn't want to use Heartmatched Fruits to get a woman's love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the Heartmatched Fruits. He had no idea if he would use them. The Heartmatched Fruits wouldn't affect anything about the person, but just make the two people who used the fruits to fall deeply in love with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui wanted to use the Heartmatched Fruits to help her regain her memories. If it couldn't be done, then the Heartmatched Fruits might cause great damage. It was because both parties would fall deeply in love with each other. It would be an irrational love. If that happened, two possible situations could occur. The first one would be that Tantai Lingyan would leave the Demon Gate for Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another possibility would be that Qing Shui would throw away everything for Tantai Lingyan, and even join the Demon Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui kept the Heartmatched Fruits. He had no idea if they would be so domineering. If he had a choice, he didn't wish to use them. He would only try them if there were no other way. He felt that the chances of being able to restore Tantai Lingyan's memories were very high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, Nuo Lan found Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister Nuo Lan, take a seat. Do you have something to say?" Qing Shui got Nuo Lan to sit down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Things are already clear. She is now the Demon Gate's Sect Leader. Moreover, the Divine Palace here is unable to stand against them. They fought once, half a month ago and the Divine Palace's Palace Lord was hurt," Nuo Lan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui frowned and said after a while, "I got it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After lunch, Qing Shui left by himself and headed north. They were still very far away from the Divine Palace. After all, the Forsaken Heaven City was very big and each great influence had their own domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after, Qing Shui saw the Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Palace was built on the local Sky Mountain. There was a Sky Mountain in Forsaken Heaven City and it was the largest mountain range there; it meandered like a huge dragon. The Divine Palace wasn't the only one built on the Sky Mountain. All major influences were basically based there after all, just at different parts of the mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sky Mountain was considered to be a Spiritual Spring. A sect could be built where a Spiritual Spring could be found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountain was very big and the peak was extremely vast, just like a plateau. This showed how vast the Sky Mountain was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Palace's buildings were also very tall. They weren't many pavilion buildings and was more like a palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their colors were rustic and impressive. Currently, the Divine Palace was filled with an oppressed feeling. Even Qing Shui could feel it while standing far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were four men on guard—two middle-aged men and two young men. When they saw Qing Shui's sudden appearance, they immediately stopped him and asked, "Who are you? What matters bring you here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person who stepped forth was a middle-aged man. He was very strong, with a goatee and appeared very valiant. He had a pair of big cowlike eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm here to meet your Palace Lord. I'm a physician," Qing Shui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Our Palace Lord won't meet anyone. Please go back," The man said directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm a Battle God. I can cure him. I'll also help your Divine Palace to fend off the Demon Gate. Go tell this to your Palace Lord," Qing Shui said directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man wanted to say something but another man who appeared more scholarly smiled and said, "Then please wait for a while. I'll go in and notify him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui didn't wait for long before that man returned. Not only did he return, but there were also three men behind him. One of them was an elderly with white sideburns and bright eyes like stars. He had a mysterious disposition which made it easy for one to have a good impression of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining two were middle-aged men with mediocre looks. However, both of them appeared mature and reliable, seemingly with good skills. One of them wore a battle armor while the other wore a silver robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All three of them were Battle Gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the old man saw Qing Shui, he frowned slightly, thinking that Qing Shui was too young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How may I address you?" The man smiled and asked. He could sense Qing Shui's Battle God's aura and as long as the person was a Battle God, there were basically no issues with loyalty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was how things were like between the Divine Palace and Demon Gate. It was hard for there to be traitors, such as for someone from the Divine Palace to be a spy in the Demon Gate. They wouldn't be able to hide their auras and there were also marks from the legacies they inherited. The price to pay for betrayal was huge and one would receive the backlash from the legacy and might even ended up being crippled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm Qing Shui. I've arrived at Forsaken Heaven City five days ago. I know medical skills and am aware that someone here is injured. Therefore, I've come to take a look." Qing Shui said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Old Master's injuries are a little serious. Do you know why the Demon Gate didn't continue to give chase? It's because he can't be saved." The old man didn't feel agitated after hearing Qing Shui's words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As long as he is still alive, I can help him recover," Qing Shui said confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know that you guys don't really trust me, but it's fine. You should have looked for quite a number of physicians as well. I'm also a Battle God, so there shouldn't be an issue with my identity, right?" Qing Shui said this casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm Zhuang Zhouyan. As for the two of them, this person who always likes to look cool and wears silver is Chen Feng. This person who always wears a battle armor is Zhang Dali," The old man gave an introduction to Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Shui shook hands with the two of them, saying, "Hello!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also shook hands with the old man and the four of them walked toward a palace building. They passed by quite a number of Battle gods on the way and all of them were generally more powerful than the ones Qing Shui had encountered in the past. However, the Battle Gods around Qing Shui had also gradually gotten stronger and were now a lot stronger than most of the people here.</span></p>
