 <p><strong>AST 1217 - The misery of having treasures at low grade, Ten Thousand Years Spiritual Limestone, Feathered Spirit Grass</strong></p>
 <p>Now, Qing Shui was already at a higher position than both Yan Jinyu and seventh princess. Yan Jinyu also just got promoted to be a high grade disciple not long ago. It hasn’t been long since seventh princess joined Heaven Secrets Academy. She was strong, hence it was fairly easy for her to get promoted to be a high grade disciple.</p>
 <p>However, becoming an elite disciple wouldn’t be as easy a task. Among a hundred people, sixty of them were normal disciples, twenty of them were high grade disciples whereas only five of them were elite disciples. From this, it could already be seen that the elite disciples were really powerful. At least inside the Heaven Secrets Academy, they still held quite a decent position. But the ones truly active in Heaven Secrets Academy were the core disciples and the people above them.</p>
 <p>“I am now an elite disciple, shall I invite the eldest princess over for the gathering?” Qing Shui asked after thinking for a while. After all, the eldest princess has also been a great help for him. If it wasn’t because of her, he wouldn’t have gotten this kind of opportunity. Hence, deep down, he still held a lot of gratitude for her.</p>
 <p>“My sister is going to come very soon. Well, at least you still have some conscience for remembering sister.” The seventh princess chuckled.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui got gloomy. What was that? But only until now did he look into the surroundings. Within this manor, there were three buildings, one pond and an area of small fake mountains. On top of the pond, there was an arched bridge and a spot with a pavilion. Within the manor, there was also a bamboo forest. It was a verdant forest which was greenish blue in color. An abundant life force spread around from it.</p>
 <p>“Even though a sparrow was small, it still had all the organs needed for it to be alive”. This place was already considered quite a decent manor. Actually, there was nothing really wrong with the previous manor. The problem with it was that everywhere were manors, hence, he somehow found it a bit awkward. Now, at least he would feel a bit more comfortable doing his morning exercise here.</p>
 <p>Not long after, the eldest princess came. When she saw Qing Shui and the girls, she smiled and greeted them. Only after that did she smile at Qing Shui: “Congratulations!”</p>
 <p>Like usual, this woman was like the bright moon across the night sky, very beautiful. Even Yan Jinyu and seventh princess were a bit inferior compared to her. No wonder Saint Child Band and the leader from Lord Sect would be so loyal to her. The kind of attraction which she could give men was fatal.</p>
 <p>Her appearance was so enchanting that it could cause people to spurt out blood. It wasn’t as simple as being sexy, it was also gentle and graceful. That was a kind of attraction that couldn’t be described in words. It was a kind of charm which came from within.</p>
 <p>Her eyes emitted a kind of tranquility. A kind of extraordinary feeling from the mortal world, causing people to not dare to blaspheme her. Qing Shui noticed that the more he interacted with it, the more his ability to self-control would decrease.</p>
 <p>He embarrassingly turned away, smiled and said to the eldest princess: “Thank you, and also, thank you for recommending me into Heaven Secrets Academy.”</p>
 <p>“Your dragon elephant is really powerful. You are a true man.” The eldest princess smiled out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s body shaked. He looked at the eldest princess and smiled: “Thanks for your compliment.”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui already knew that the eldest princess knew about the things that happened which involved him in the Huge Desolated City, so much so that QIng Shui could sense that the eldest princess was just around them at that time. The reason why she called him a man might have had to do with the fact that he didn’t run away while facing off against the Fire Dragon at that time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui saw both of the eldest princess’ beautiful eyes looking back at him. They seemed as if they were intending to see through him. Qing Shui was able to see something from her eyes. It should be about himself refining demons…… It’s just that she hasn’t inquired about anything for now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui rubbed his head and avoided the eldest princess’ eyes. Now, he was already considered to have temporarily got onto the eldest princess’ boat. If he wasn’t mistaken, the eldest princess has also known about him killing off people from Saint Child Band.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really hoped that the eldest princess found out about all these from other people instead of her witnessing it herself. However, Qing Shui knew that the possibility of the latter was really huge, because she was worried about the seventh princess, yet she was unable to take action herself. It’s very likely that she was trying to train her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On his first night in the new manor, Qing Shui entered the realm very early. He left the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant outside to guard the night. With it being there, Qing Shui could go into the realm in peace and not get distracted.</p>
 <p>Like usual, he refined his magic treasures. It’s just that for now, basically, it’s very hard for them to be upgraded. Qing Shui saw the Heaven Shaking Drum, Spirit Gathering Drum and Coiled Dragon Statue. As far as the current Golden Scale Dragon Elephant was concerned, Qing Shui no longer knew whether the Heaven Shaking Drum was still taking effect.</p>
 <p>With his current strength, he was no longer capable of knowing whether a scene caused by two million nimbus would be the same as a scene caused with the strength of four million nimbus. Or rather, he didn’t even know whether the attack the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant used the other day contained a strength which worth a million and twenty thousand nimbus or two million and forty thousand nimbus…...</p>
 <p>He couldn’t achieve it with his strength. Once Qing Shui refined that strength, he would be able to experience it.</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah, can I ask about the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant?”</p>
 <p>It’s just that upon learning the news, Qing Shui got upset, the reason being that the strength of the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant didn’t actually get increased because of the Heaven Shaking Drum. This was because the grade of the Heaven Shaking Drum was no longer able to catch up to its strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui really felt like cursing. But as he thought deeper into it, he let go of that intention. He has already picked up a great deal. It’s just that it was a waste that the Heaven Shaking Drum didn’t work. But he wasn’t afraid of it, once the Heaven Shaking Drum ascended in grade, it would naturally be able to once again significantly increase the strength of his demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Grades….. Without grades, everything would just be decorations. Similarly, it was also hardest for this thing to level up. For treasures like Heaven Shaking Drum, once it reached fifth grade, it’s already became considerably hard for it to continue ascending. This was only because the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant was too powerful. It’s like back then with the Big Dipper Sword, it couldn’t help amplify Qing Shui’s Spirit Energy and was no longer able to draw out its use as expected.</p>
 <p>These phenomenons were very usual. It’s just that it made people felt really upset.</p>
 <p>Alright, now, he felt that there was one more thing for him to look forward to. He looked forward to the Heaven Shaking Drum, Coiled Dragon Statue and the Spirit Gathering Lamp going up in grade. That was the only way, there would come a day when all of his demonic beasts became really strong.</p>
 <p>The Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant woke up. It seemed like the Nirvanic Fruit has ripened. It’s just that the Fire Bird hadn’t actually eaten it. Like usual, it would visit that place everyday and burn them with its own Fire of Life. Qing Shui felt that these Nirvanic Fruits would very likely make the Fire Bird’s strength increase significantly. It’s just like letting it go through Nirvana Rebirth. It might even end up just like the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant. Similarly, Qing Shui really looked forward to this day.</p>
 <p>If these demonic beasts of his could all be incomparably strong, it would be equivalent of himself being strong. This way, in the future, he would feel extremely confident wherever he went. This was because there were a lot of things he needed to do. After four years, there were people from his family who would also come. By then, they needed him to take care of them.</p>
 <p>As Qing Shui thought about all of these, he felt all fired up. His entire body was filled with motivation. He considered it as fighting for a reputation for his own family members.</p>
 <p>Other than that, what Qing Shui was happy about was that the Thousand Years Gloomy Tree had grown quite a lot of green fruits. He knew that the fruits contained extremely powerful Yin attributed force. What made him puzzled was that it was the favorite food source for the current Six-headed Demonic Spider. After every set amount of time, it would eat one of them.</p>
 <p>Other than the Six-headed Demonic Spider, the Spirited Snake Turtle also liked it. As for the other demonic beasts, none of them would really approach it. After every set amount of time, the Six-headed Demonic Spider would eat one of the fruits. During this period of time, its strength would increase by folds. The spider web it spat out would be more tough, sticky and poisonous.</p>
 <p>Six-headed Demonic Spider, female!</p>
 <p>This, Qing Shui could understand. But as for the Spirited Snake Turtle…… He remembered from his past incarnation that turtles contained large fire and it helped to significantly nourish one’s body. But very quickly, Qing Shui managed to find out the problem. The Spirited Snake Turtle, snake was a Yin animal.</p>
 <p>Could it have something to do with this?</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t concerned about this. That entire tree of green fruits would be enough food source for both the Six-Headed Demonic Spider and Spirited Snake Turtle for quite a while. Besides, even after they ate it, new ones would still grow.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui didn’t know up to what kind of level the Six-headed Demonic Spider and the Spirited Snake Turtle would attain by relying on the Thousand Years Gloomy Fruit. In any case, the Six-headed Demonic Spider relied on its spider web. Besides that, its strength would also increase. With its current speed, Qing Shui felt that the pace at which it improved was really terrifying. Even though it wasn’t like the sudden burst of improvement demonstrated by the Golden Scaled Dragon Elephant, but this kind of pace was in a way also considered to be insane. It’s just that he didn’t know for how long this pace would last for.</p>
 <p>This was a good thing. He made himself calm his mind down and entered the state of cultivation.</p>
 <p>Seal of Roc!</p>
 <p>About the Divine Nebula Formation, now, Qing Shui was already trying hard to arrange the sixty second star. Unfortunately, he failed again and again. But every time he attempted it, there would be progress and improvements.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui felt necessary to cultivate the Eight-eight Divine Nebula Formation within this time. By doing so, he would be able to significantly increase his strength and spirit energy. This was because he knew that the Realm of Violet Jade Immortal was somehow related to another factor, that was, the spirit energy.</p>
 <p>All along, he always had this thought with him. Maybe by improving his spirit energy up to a certain extent, he would be able to upgrade the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. Now, the source of contradictions have all been pointed towards the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal. It seemed like everything would only be able to develop smoothly once the Realm of the Violet Jade Immortal upgraded.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At the blink of an eye, half a month has passed. His raw strength once again increased by two nimbus. Qing Shui seemed to no longer feel excited with this. It’s just like the feeling when he was guarding an entire gold mountain, he wouldn’t fear that he had not enough gold to spend. At the moment when he saw two more golds, he wouldn’t have found it uncommon.</p>
 <p>The Seal of Roc was just the same as before. As for the Double Eight Divine Nebula Formation, he has spent three days within the realm trying to arrange the last star but with no result. It’s always so close… He was just one step short from success…...</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wasn’t really that upset. During daytime, he would guide the girl through her cultivation. This witch-like girl was already going to achieve the strength of a second grade State Master very soon. As for her capabilities in real combat… It was even more powerful.</p>
 <p>At the time when Qing Shui helped her acupunctured, Qing Shui felt that the Blood Terminating Force within her body was slowly blending into her body. By the time the energy from the Blood Terminator Bead completely merged into her body, the pace at which her strength increased would no longer be as terrifying as now.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stretched out his senses. The girl could barely make it to third grade State Master. Once that happened, she would no longer be able to improve at incredible pace like now.</p>
 <p>Half a month passed. The girl would cultivate Taichi Fist twice. In the morning and at night. At other times, she would cultivate the Tiger Form as well as a few footsteps. Qing Shui would also guide the flow of her pernicious aura and baleful aura with his Gold Needles , enabling the wounding power of the girl’s attacks to be a lot stronger than her own strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui was really happy seeing the progress the little girl made. Now, the girl seemed a lot more relaxed in front of him compared to before. She had also started showing a lot more expressions compared to before. Other than cultivating everyday, she would also talk to Qing Shui. But normally, they were also things concerning her cultivation. She had never spoken anything about her. Qing Shui didn’t ask. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to get anything unless the girl decided to say it herself.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, I have found the Ten Thousand Years Spiritual Limestone and Feathered Spirit Grass you wanted.” Qing Shui heard the eldest princess’ voice.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui turned around only to find that the eldest princess has arrived. He remembered that he once requested her to help him find the materials for Spiritual Liquid. At that time, he wasn’t really concerned about it. He never expected that she would actually find it.</p>
 <p>“Oh, well then, thank you! After I refined it, I will share a bit with you.” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“You are being too stingy. You only shared a little with us, you should at least share half of it!” It’s very rare that the eldest princess would talk so casually. That beautiful face of her made people not dared to look directly at it.</p>
 <p>“Actually, this little bit is already half of them. For all you know, I feel that there may only be a drop of it. Let’s hope for the best and hope that we will be able to get two drops of it. If not, I don’t think I will be able to share with you……” Qing Shui smiled and said.</p>
