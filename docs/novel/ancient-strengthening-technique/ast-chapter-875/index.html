 <p><strong>AST 875 - Magnificent Violet Lightning Strike, Insta-kill, Refining Demons</strong></p>
 <p>Looking at that unnatural expression of the lady, Qing Shui hurriedly turned his head aside, not wanting to see that lovable appearance. He started to laugh mockingly at himself. It was easy for men to lose their self-control in front of women. Although he did not want to provoke any other woman, there were still times where it was easy for him to get distracted. In fact it was not a definite thing that he needed to possess her, however he was unable to control himself. This was the charm of beautiful women.</p>
 <p>The lady quickly regained her composure. However she could not help but feel shameful for what happened earlier, in her heart. She was thinking about whether she had purposefully grabbed his hand, what would he think about this, would he think of her as...thinking about this, she felt that her heart was in complete disarray.</p>
 <p>Very quickly she felt worried about her own thoughts and for a moment became stunned and at a complete loss.</p>
 <p>The hysterical Berserk Dragons were once again slaughtered completely. When Qing Shui waved his hands to activated the Soulshake Bell again, the gigantic fiery red figure on the mountaintop suddenly ferociously launched itself over, obviously targeting Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Although the distance was too far its speed was akin to the speed of lightning.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui put away the Soulshake Bell and took out the Descending Heavens Talisman as well as the two Ten Thousand Year Coldsteel Bead dipped in highly toxic poisons. Then, he stared at the gigantic demonic beast currently heading here at rapid speed.</p>
 <p>The gigantic demonic beast did not fly, however its speed seemed faster than flying. Every jump and bound it made shoot it over hundreds of meters each time.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui stared closely at it. At the same time, the lady and those old people from the Mu Family were also staring at that Berserk Dragon King. They were experts of a region and could feel how terrifying this gigantic Berserk Dragon King was.</p>
 <p>Time did not permit them rest and if they continued on like that everyone would run dry. In addition, there were strong beastial roars ringing faintly from a distance, causing people’s hearts to palpitate.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui started to slowly calm down. This was a very strange feeling. He was quietly contemplating and waiting. The Berserk Dragon King was very fast and even Qing Shui felt that his speed was still inferior to it.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Descending Heavens Talisman in Qing Shui’s hand rapidly shot out.</p>
 <p>It was unable to hit anything at this distance, however the Berserk Dragon King was still running over. Therefore it had arrived at just the right moment. Seemingly at the same time, Qing Shui’s Emperor’s Qi and Fiery Golden Eyes had already rapidly shot out.</p>
 <p>At this time there was no need to be polite, furthermore the people in the surroundings could only see him sending out the talisman. At the same time, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant rushed towards the Berserk Dragon King as it activated “Vajra Subdues Demons”.</p>
 <p>Vajra’s Glare!</p>
 <p>After using his techniques, Qing Shui did not even bother to calculate his opponent’s remaining strength, as he immediately summoned the Thunderous Beast while shooting forward at the same time.</p>
 <p>Seven Star Armored Vest!</p>
 <p>“It’s dangerous, come back!” upon seeing Qing Shui’s actions, the lady panicked and shouted in a loud voice.</p>
 <p>Violet Lightning Strike!</p>
 <p>After Qing Shui had shot forward for a certain distance, the Thunderous Beast sent a Violet Lightning Strike at the Berserk Dragon King, instantly locking it in the sky. At this moment, Qing Shui’s two Ten Thousand Year Coldsteel Beads suddenly shot out. The most important thing now was that Qing Shui was within ten meters of the Berserk Dragon King.</p>
 <p>The reason why Qing Shui rushed out was that he was worried about the duration of the Lightning Beast’s Violet Lightning Strike. Also if he was too far away, he was afraid that the other Berserk Dragons would interfere. Therefore he had seemingly finished everything from weakening to attacking in an instant.</p>
 <p>The two Ten Thousand Year Coldsteel Beads infused with extremely toxic poisons shot straight at the two gigantic eyes of the Berserk Dragon King. That was the weakest place in its body. Furthermore, the most important point was that they could shoot directly into its brain, causing lethal damage.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui wanted to kill it in one strike, as time did not permit him otherwise. After a single attack, he immediately retreated. Within that short instant, Qing Shui had already been attacked for tens of times. Fortunately he had evaded any lethal attacks as he had the Seven Star Armored Vest, coupled with people supporting him for a place not far from him.</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast stood at a distance and continuously used its Thunderbolt. Any Vampiric Falcon Vulture that was struck would instantly be killed. The high single target attack added to its base strength as well as the Spirit Gathering Lamp made it have a very strong effect.</p>
 <p>Only when Qing Shui had returned to his original position, did the gigantic Berserk Dragon King start crying out mournfully and miserably. Its eyes were blinded, as the two Ten Thousand Year Coldsteel Beads entered its brain carrying along highly toxic poisons.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>Immense roars rang out as the pain caused it to unceasingly go crazy where it was. All of the demonic beasts around it suffered a calamity, as they had a huge disparity in size compared to it, with their strength being even more so. Therefore a large number of them were instantly killed by the crazy Berserking Dragon King.</p>
 <p>Thunderbolt!</p>
 <p>The Thunderous Beast’s Thunderbolt continuously landed on the Berserk Dragon King’s body. Added with the rapid flare-up of the poisons, it quickly collapsed.</p>
 <p>The Berserk Dragon King died, which instantly disturbed the entire Berserk Dragon horde. At this time Qing Shui and the rest would naturally not give up on this chance, with him taking out the Soulshake Bell again.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the beastial horde became restless, they began to retreat and then fled. Along with those that had fled earlier due to the Soulshake Bell, the demonic beasts that fled quickly formed small groups.</p>
 <p>These groups started to gradually expand as close quarter battles continued. The most important point was that their king was already dead. Gradually, the number of fleeing ones grew larger and larger. As for the Vampiric Falcon Vultures in the air, they seemed to be unwilling to leave, making sharp screeches as they stared at the corpses on the ground.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui gave a stomp on the rock floor below him, immediately creating many shattered chunks of rock. Qing Shui’s hand quickly swept across the rocks tumbling in the air. Every time he touched a rock it would rapidly shoot out, taking the life of a Vampiric Falcon Vulture in the process.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s actions were methodical and thoroughly and very quickly many Vampiric Falcon Vulture corpses fell onto the ground. At the same time, the Diamond Gigantic Elephant activated the Mighty Elephant’s Recklessness and rushed into the cast of Vampiric Falcon Vultures.</p>
 <p>Mighty Elephant’s Stomp!</p>
 <p>The Diamond Gigantic Elephant had tough skin and thick muscle. Without the Berserk Dragon horde, these Blood Sucking Falcon Vampires were nothing to worry about.</p>
 <p>“Let’s quickly descend. We can’t stay here for long,” said the lady as she walked over to Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“Okay!”</p>
 <p>Qing Shui recalled his demonic beasts and quickly descended with the lady and the Mu family people. While traveling he conveniently threw the Berserk Dragon King’s corpse into the Realm of the Violet Immortal and also a few Berserk Dragon corpses, in preparation for drawing talismans.</p>
 <p>This battle made Qing Shui realize the might of the Thunderous Beast. Naturally there was also the mysterious usefulness of the Spirit Gathering Lamp. It could double the might of the demonic beast’s magic. Not only could it double the might, in addition, it could double the auxiliary effects and intensity too.</p>
 <p>For example, the speed reduction effect of the Violet Lightning Strike was doubled, as was the paralysis effect time!.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui and the other people of the Mu Family followed the lady and rapidly traveled through the mountain valley, quickly reaching a place that was unobstructed on three fronts with a concealed mountain cave ahead. After battling for half a day, everyone was tired.</p>
 <p>Upon entering it, they sealed the mountain cave with a gigantic stone.</p>
 <p>The intelligence of demonic beasts was inferior to humans and most would simply not knock any rock they see. After sealing the cave, very little light could penetrate in. Fortunately, the lady took out some light stones and placed them at a few corners. After doing so, everyone took their time to pitch their tents, while a few old people placed cotton mattresses beside a wall not far away. Sitting down they started to chat.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had also pitched his tent, however he had finished it quickly. After saying his greetings to the others, he entered his tent. He still had things to do and he could not waste time.</p>
 <p>For the Berserk Dragon King corpse that he had thrown in earlier, he had in fact wanted to subdue this kind of demonic beast. The only thing was that he could not achieve that, nor could the lady and she was a beast tamer.</p>
 <p>However, the reason why Qing Shui had immediately killed it was because the king of a demonic beast horde is seemingly impossible to be tamed. The success rates were too small, especially when one wanted to forcefully tame it, which could just be neglected.</p>
 <p>It was due to this reason that Qing Shui had killed it. He had planned to refine it later and the time of a demonic beast’s was death was important, as it could not be too long. Therefore Qing Shui had hurriedly pitched his tent before heading into the Realm of the Violet Immortal.</p>
 <p>A moment in the outside world was a very long time in the Realm of the Violet Immortal. The shorter the period since death, the better the results were. Therefore, upon entering his hand immediately started the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace up, throwing the Berserk Dragon King corpse into it.</p>
 <p>After swallowing a Vital Essence Pill, he started his refinement. Now it was considered a walk in the park, as he was already very clear on the places that he needed to pay attention to. Added with the growth of his strength and spirit energy, this made Qing Shui feel relaxed and pleased with refining.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace slowly started to shrink, as the glow on its surface continuously sparkled. The demonic beast drawings were clear and natural, vivid and lifelike, even continuously producing faint beastial roars, showing its awe and prestige.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s hands gently patted the surface of the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace, spirit energy continuously entering it through his use of the Thousand Buddha Palm Imprint. This made his refinement of demonic beasts seem as if it was a coincidence.</p>
 <p>This was because he had tested this way ever since he had started doing this, all the way until he gradually discovered that his refining abilities were very strong. This might be due to the relationship between the Primordial Demon Refining Furnace and the “Buddha’s Power” within his body.</p>
 <p>The Primordial Demon Refining Furnace grew smaller and smaller as the various pure light halos grew more and more abundant. The drawing grew more clear and distinct as it slowly regained its original small size.</p>
 <p>A familiar sound rang out, informing Qing Shui it succeeded. Every time he refined he would be excited. This time was no different, thus he had immediately taken a look at the furnace after its completion.</p>
 <p>Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl!</p>
 <p>In the first look he spotted the familiar demonic beast essence pill. Scarlet red in color, it was the size of a fist and radiated violent energies. In actual fact, when refining demonic beasts what Qing Shui had anticipated the most was the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl!</p>
 <p>There were also three crystal cards, with the drawings on them being the image of the Berserk Dragon King.</p>
 <p>Looking at its description, it was “Berserk”. When used, it would add a certain amount of berserk strength.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui thought the concept of it was slightly unclear, however he had the Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl and that was sufficient for him. The value of it was absolutely the highest he ever achieved and it was the strongest Demonic Beast Origin Essence Soul Pearl he had ever refined.</p>
 <p>After putting all of these things away, he left the Realm of the Violet Immortal. After all it was still daytime. Everyone had come here to rest for a while. Walking out of the tent, he saw that there were still some people inside their tents, while the rest were outside.</p>
 <p>He did not place the previous battle in his heart, as he had seen many similar instances and had already been used to it.</p>
 <p>Now it was already noon and the previous battle had resulted in too much consumption of their energy. There was already a large piece of Berserk Dragon meat as well as an antelope in the cave. Although it could be said that the stronger the demonic beast the more delicious it's meat was, there were people who disliked eating demonic beast meat.</p>
 <p>It was time to roast the meat. Now there would be numerous people working together to roast the meat and prepare the food. An old person sprinkled some powder at the cave entrance. This could prevent the air within the cave from circulating to the outside and it lasted for 24 hours.</p>
 <p>This battle had thoroughly caused all the old people not dare to look down on Qing Shui, especially after the Thunderous Beast had shown itself. The beautiful Violet Lightning Strike and Qing Shui’s lethal attack had caused their hearts to palpitate.</p>
 <p>This youth was a killer. In fact they still did not know that Qing Shui had used weakening techniques when killing that Berserk Dragon King. For now, they were unable to determine the extent of Qing Shui’s strength.</p>
