 <p><strong>Chapter 106 Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><b>AST 0106 – Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang</b></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui snickered as he said, “Wu-Shuang, custom states that only a husband can help his wife to put on her shoes!” </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, then let me do it myself!” She retracted her beautiful foot, but in her heart, she thought the foot massage was very comfortable.</span></p>
  <p><span style>At this moment, the thumping sound of someone knocking on the door came from the outside. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui stood up to open the door, and saw his smiling mother standing there. He couldn’t help but blush a little. “Mother, come in.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Yi saw Wenren Wu-Shuang, she only had one thought. Her grace was shining, and her beautiful was incomparable. She heard Qing Shi say that she looked like a fairy. She didn’t believe it the first time, but now that she saw Wu-Shuang, she was indeed like a celestial who descended from the heavens. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang was having different thoughts at that moment: “No wonder this kid seems so charming and charismatic. He has such a graceful and beautiful mother.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Ah, hello aunt!” Wenren Wu-Shuang quickly put on her shoes and stood up. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Don’t move. If you’re still weak, then just lay down. I’ve finished preparing the food; I’ll let Qing Shui bring it to you. Your name is Wu-Shuang right? Your beauty really is unparalleled</span><b>*</b><span style>.” Qing Yi said happily as she held Wenren Wu-Shuang’s hand warmly to lead her back to the bed. </span></p>
  <p><b>*</b><span style>-(TL note: Wu-Shuang means unparalleled)</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Aunt you are the one who is still beautiful despite your age. How can I, Wu-Shuang, compare to you? I’m already not worthy of mentioning,” Wenren Wu-Shuang politely laughed though she was a little anxious in her heart. She didn’t know why, but she was a little nervous. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Yi looked at Qing Shui, and Qing Shui nodded. “Let’s go eat, Wu-Shuang. Try out mom’s delicious cooking.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang didn’t know whether Qing Shui’s words were intentional or not, but when she heard “mom”, she instantly blushed. However, Qing Yi was cheerfully winking towards Qing Shui. </span></p>
  <p><i><span style>This kid has such affinity with women. He is close to Yu He, plus there’s also rumors that he is close to Shi Qingzhuang. Now there’s another, Wenren Wu-Shuang. The most important thing is that each of them is a peerless beauty!</span></i><span style> Qing Yi looked at her all grown-up son and lightly sighed. </span></p>
  <p><span style>When Qing Shang, Qing Shi, and Yuan Ying saw Wenren Wu-Shuang, they were all astonished. “She is so beautiful!” Qing Shan said blankly.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Since Qing Shi already went blank once, his expression was a little better compared to the others.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’re a Xiantian cultivator?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“You’re so pretty. Are you friends with Qing Shui?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Do you like Qing Shui?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang, “…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui lightly hit Qing Shi’s head, “Little kids shouldn’t ask such unnecessary things.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui’s words provoked a wave of merry laughter as well as Qing Shi’s upset voice. During this period of time, Qing Shui, Qing Shan, and Qing Shi were usually together and told each other everything. Young people talk about everything when they are together, and they would of course often talk about women. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Comrades who went to battle together, roommates who shared a room together, and bros who visited brothels together. These were the three ways in which strong bonds were formed in the previous world. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui, Qing Shan, and Qing Shi were cousins in the first place, plus they were always together since their ages were similar. The result was that their relationship was this way. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Qing Shui, impart some of your experience on me. How can I make beautiful little sisters fall for me?” Qing Shi said half-jokingly with subtleties in his expression. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Black fish and turtles were delicious in the first place, but they also greatly aided in recovery, making even Wenren Wu-Shuang’s eyes sparkle as she ate and stared strangely at Qing Shui. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“Aunt, your culinary skills are excellent. This is the most delicious delicacy that I, Wu-Shuang, have ever tasted. I would be so grateful to have such skills like you.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“If it’s delicious, then eat more. If Wu-Shuang doesn’t have anything to do, then just come over to eat. Aunt would be so delighted if you came by often.” Qing Yi said while smiling satisfyingly. </span></p>
  <p><span style>“If you want to capture a woman’s heart, you have to first capture her stomach.” Qing Shui seriously said to Qing Shan.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shan nodded in deadly earnestness!</span></p>
  <p><span style>Others, “…”</span></p>
  <p><span style>It was early evening. Outside, the lanterns were lit; their light stones emitting soft rays of light. Since there were many lanterns, the streets of Hundred Miles City were brightly lit as if it were daytime. </span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang walked towards the Night Fragrance Court together. The night market on the streets was bustling with noise and excitement; everywhere people were talking and laughing. The main attractions of the night market were snacks and refreshments, but of course there were also antiques and small toys as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style>The most common types of people in the night market were families, young lovers, some closer friends, or youths who had feelings for each other!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Big brother, your girlfriend is so pretty! Buy a flower for her!” A childish voice sounded.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui tilted his head down, and saw a little girl who was around five years old. She had a huge pair of eyes, but they didn’t have much energy. In the basket that she was holding, there were about ten roses.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at this little girl. The way she talked was very child-like. He didn’t deny the relationship between Wenren Wu-Shuang and himself because the girl was too young. However, Wenren Wu-Shuang’s face was flushing with red, but Qing Shui was already kneeling in front of the girl. “Little girl, how can you sell flowers at such an early age? Where is your family?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Big brother, your girlfriend is so beautiful. Buy a flower for her!” The little girl widened her big eyes and stared hopefully at Qing Shui.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui sighed, took a flower, and handed the little girl a tael of silver. He reached out his hand to rub her small head, and silently injected light pressure on her Muchuang, Zhenying, Fengling, Naokong, and Fengfu acupoints.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Thank you big brother!” </span></p>
  <p><span style>The little girl left without even realizing that Qing Shui gave her more than silver. Though she did know to say thank you, she looked extremely slow-witted.</span></p>
  <p><span style>When she saw Qing Shui sigh, Wenren Wu-Shuang quietly said, “You already gave her a tael of silver. That should be enough to support her for a while.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui shook his head. “That money won’t stay in her hands. Didn’t you notice that she could only speak two sentences?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang frowned. Though she was very intelligent, she did not think too deeply about the incident. “Are you trying to say that someone else is controlling her?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Yes, so it doesn’t matter how much more money we give her. I’m just trying my best, and hoping that whoever is acting behind her would let her have a full meal because of this tael of silver.”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui was not pretending to be smart by saying all of this. His family in his previous life was average. Since he came from the countryside, he knew the difficulties of being poor. When he went to the city to study later, he saw too many rich people, and he developed a hatred for the rich. Whenever he saw beggars in the street, whether it was real or fake, he would take money out of his pocket. He tried his best to help the terribly tragic situations of the poor.</span></p>
  <p><span style>He didn’t ask for anything in return, and believed that others who did these same kinds of things would know. He only wanted to do his part. Some of the poor, wouldn’t even have access to cultivation techniques, which sealed them in an unending cycle of poverty. Only through strength, would enable you to lead a better life in this cultivation-oriented world.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Wenren Wushuang’s impression of Qing Shui suddenly got better by loads. The warmth of her eyes as she regarded Qing Shui, was different from the past. At this moment, she only felt that Qing Shui was extremely charismatic, and it was not because of the help he gave the girl, but because of the state of his heart!</span></p>
  <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you save that little girl?” Wenren Wu-Shuang asked, puzzled.</span></p>
  <p><span style>“There would always be a reason behind why it existed, this is not a stand-alone case, this is the evilness inherent in humanity. I don’t have the ability, even if I saved the little girl, so what? She wouldn’t be happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we have the consider the safety of the family of the little girl. If we save the girl, would the other party get revenge on them?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>Looking at the despondent look on Wu-Shuang’s face, Qing Shui replied, “Okay, stop thinking about it, I believe there would be fairness for her. Good exists within evil, and light exists within darkness. If there were no villains in this world, how would there be good people?”</span></p>
  <p><span style>The eyes which Wu-Shuang regarded Qing Shui with, shined with a bright glow, “Your thinking is weird, but it seems to make sense in a strange sort of way.</span></p>
  <p><span style>Qing Shui laughed bitterly, so does that means he had logic or not? This must be the Dao of “Warped Logic”!</span></p>

 <p><span style>Qing Shui and Wenren Wu-Shuang walked towards the Night Fragrance Court together. The night market on the streets was bustling with noise and excitement; everywhere people were talking and laughing. The main attractions of the night market were snacks and refreshments, but of course there were also antiques and small toys as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most common types of people in the night market were families, young lovers, some closer friends, or youths who had feelings for each other!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, your girlfriend is so pretty! Buy a flower for her!” A childish voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui tilted his head down, and saw a little girl who was around five years old. She had a huge pair of eyes, but they didn’t have much energy. In the basket that she was holding, there were about ten roses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui looked at this little girl. The way she talked was very child-like. He didn’t deny the relationship between Wenren Wu-Shuang and himself because the girl was too young. However, Wenren Wu-Shuang’s face was flushing with red, but Qing Shui was already kneeling in front of the girl. “Little girl, how can you sell flowers at such an early age? Where is your family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, your girlfriend is so beautiful. Buy a flower for her!” The little girl widened her big eyes and stared hopefully at Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui sighed, took a flower, and handed the little girl a tael of silver. He reached out his hand to rub her small head, and silently injected light pressure on her Muchuang, Zhenying, Fengling, Naokong, and Fengfu acupoints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you big brother!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little girl left without even realizing that Qing Shui gave her more than silver. Though she did know to say thank you, she looked extremely slow-witted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Qing Shui sigh, Wenren Wu-Shuang quietly said, “You already gave her a tael of silver. That should be enough to support her for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui shook his head. “That money won’t stay in her hands. Didn’t you notice that she could only speak two sentences?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenren Wu-Shuang frowned. Though she was very intelligent, she did not think too deeply about the incident. “Are you trying to say that someone else is controlling her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, so it doesn’t matter how much more money we give her. I’m just trying my best, and hoping that whoever is acting behind her would let her have a full meal because of this tael of silver.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui was not pretending to be smart by saying all of this. His family in his previous life was average. Since he came from the countryside, he knew the difficulties of being poor. When he went to the city to study later, he saw too many rich people, and he developed a hatred for the rich. Whenever he saw beggars in the street, whether it was real or fake, he would take money out of his pocket. He tried his best to help the terribly tragic situations of the poor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t ask for anything in return, and believed that others who did these same kinds of things would know. He only wanted to do his part. Some of the poor, wouldn’t even have access to cultivation techniques, which sealed them in an unending cycle of poverty. Only through strength, would enable you to lead a better life in this cultivation-oriented world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenren Wushuang’s impression of Qing Shui suddenly got better by loads. The warmth of her eyes as she regarded Qing Shui, was different from the past. At this moment, she only felt that Qing Shui was extremely charismatic, and it was not because of the help he gave the girl, but because of the state of his heart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you save that little girl?” Wenren Wu-Shuang asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There would always be a reason behind why it existed, this is not a stand-alone case, this is the evilness inherent in humanity. I don’t have the ability, even if I saved the little girl, so what? She wouldn’t be happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we have the consider the safety of the family of the little girl. If we save the girl, would the other party get revenge on them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the despondent look on Wu-Shuang’s face, Qing Shui replied, “Okay, stop thinking about it, I believe there would be fairness for her. Good exists within evil, and light exists within darkness. If there were no villains in this world, how would there be good people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes which Wu-Shuang regarded Qing Shui with, shined with a bright glow, “Your thinking is weird, but it seems to make sense in a strange sort of way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Shui laughed bitterly, so does that means he had logic or not? This must be the Dao of “Warped Logic”!</span></p>
