  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Chapter 394 - Acknowledgement, Who Doesn’t Know How to Write the Word ‘Death’?</strong></p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiao Shao became extremely pale after Qing Shui had beaten Xiao Tian to death in an instant. He stood there amidst the chilly weather with cold sweat rolling down his back. There was a void in his terrified gaze.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It was at this moment that Xiao Tian felt that his own death nearing. He was the “young master Yan” who could get what he wanted as he pleased, and any woman he fancied would be considered lucky. He might just be a lower disciple of the Yan Clan, but he was the most nurtured one of them all.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, he felt that all these luxuries would soon fade away from him. He didn’t want to die just yet, because he still hasn’t enjoyed himself enough!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to die, I cannot die! I will do anything you want, just don’t kill me!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiao Shao quickly prostrated himself on the ground as he shouted with a deafening voice. His thirst for life and cowardly demeanor had been completely exposed!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Useless. You are only making a fool out of yourself!” A cold grunt pierced through the atmosphere.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiao Shao, who was crawling on the ground, suddenly stood up when he heard that voice. It were as if he had heard the sound of a celestial being. He called out with a surprised tone: “Second brother, second brother, you have come. Thank goodness...”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Xiao Shao stood up happily and laughed as he spoke!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked on with an unwavering expression at the sudden appearance of the young man. The young man was handsome and elegant; he had nice skin and a sharp nose, as well as a pair of cold eyes.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was about 30 years old. Qing Shui had already analyzed his power within a single glance.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The peak of the Xiantian!” Qing Shui shook his head lightly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Where did this wild one come from? You’ve got guts. Do you even know how to write the word ‘Death’?” The young man stared at Qing Shui coldly with murderous intent overflowing.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you know who she is?” Qing Shui gently pointed at Qing Qing as he asked the young man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just a bastard…..”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Pa!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui’s figure shifted, as if he had just swayed on the spot. The young man, however, was knocked out from where he was standing. His right cheek was heavily swollen as he regained his composure. Some of his white teeth were knocked out as well. The handsome young man has become a pig head in an instant.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Blood was dripping out from the corner of his mouth as he looked at Qing Shui with terrified eyes. One move from Qing Shui had clearly told him everything he needed to know. The young man could not even see how Qing Shui had made his move towards him.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He was clearly in pain, but he couldn’t utter a sound! The blow to his heart was more painful than his physical wounds. He even acted almighty in front of his opponent, asking if he could write the word ‘death’.....&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“She is a member of the Qing family. Her surname is Qing, not Yan. She no longer had anything to do with Yan Clan the moment she stepped out from the Yan Residence.” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“I won’t kill you so you can relay this back to Yan Clan. The debts from 20 years ago have all been paid. Also, anyone who was involved in kicking out Qing Qing will die, no matter who they are.” Qing Shui then shot out two stones!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Pu pu!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">One stone pierced through Xiao Shao’s head and the other broke the testicles of the young man. One had lost his life, and the other had lost half. He would be crippled for the rest of his life.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Remember, my surname is Qing. They will remember what they did back then if they hear this name!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui was finished, he went straight to where Qing Yi was!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mother, let’s go back!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Okay!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi felt happy, really happy. This would be the happiest day in the past 20 years of her life. At least part of the hollow space in her heart had been filled up once again. However, it pained her to see her apathetic daughter by her side. She has made up her mind to spend the rest of her time and give all her love to Qing Qing. Although it would not compensate for what had happened during those times, Qing Yi could at least feel better about it. &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Qing Qing who was wearing the fox fur robe they had put on her. His dear sister may be a year older than him, but all he wanted to do now was treat her like a little sister.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Because he wanted to protect her!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Sis… Big Sister!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stuttered as he shouted! He had to be the one to clear the path to reunite their relationship!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">For now, Qing Yi could not possibly allow her daughter to call her ‘mother’. She couldn’t hope for it! All these years she had never once given her anything but suffering….</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, however, could call her his big sister, and so he did. However, it was difficult to imagine a man stuttering and being so straightforward when he had just displayed the expressions, actions, and words of a murderous man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing stared blankly at the man who had similar features to herself. She nodded on an impulse and said: “You are the man who bought the tea leaves earlier.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed awkwardly and said: “Big sister, let’s go back first. I will explain everything to you later, alright?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing nodded her head. Even in this harsh cold weather, she was still calm. Qing Shui wondered, would anyone else except Guo Polu buy the tea leaves she was selling?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised that the beast car was still in the same spot where they had left. He quickly went inside the car with everyone!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master, take us back to where we came from. Here’s the money!” Qing Shui handed him twice the money he had given him the first time.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Mister, this is too much!” The burly old man quickly said as he drove his car hurriedly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“It’s not easy for an old man like you to drive in this snow-covered land. You deserve it!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">………...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Residence!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When Yan Yidao came back, he immediately grabbed everyone’s attention with his disfigured face. A lot of people exclaimed in shock, and soon enough, the news had spread to the elders of the Yan Clan.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">At the same time, the spies of the Yan Clan had reported the incident to Yan Clan master Yan Haozheng! &nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The senior branch of the Yan Clan quickly convened a family meeting. Only the senior branch members would be in the meeting as the other five branches had nearly been annihilated!&nbsp;</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The meeting convened in the big hall!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Hundred of seats had been filled with people who ranged from youngsters to elderly men. The refined man who sat at the head of the table was around his 50s. His hair and brows were all white, but his face was free of wrinkles. The most distinctive feature were his eyes. They looked wise and bright.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He looked like a high-ranking person who wore a yellow brocade robe. The man has a fierce aura that could cut through anyone like a knife, which was why nobody dared to look him in the eyes. This man was the master of the Yan Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Haozheng!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Today we have gathered everyone here for the obvious reason. You all should know what has happened earlier. For those who are out of the loop, you may state your questions or ask around right now. Do not take more than 8 minutes!” Yan Haozheng said without much exaggeration.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">However, all the members below were deathly silent. Yan Haozheng nevertheless closed his eyes and waited for the time to go by. When the 8 minutes was up, Yan Haozheng slowly opened his eyes and swept his glance across the hall.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“The people from the Qing Clan came earlier. This is a consequence left by Yan Zhongyue’s unfortunate love from the sixth branch. The man demanded for the debts the Yan Clan has owed to the Qing Clan, as well as the death of those who were involved in the matter of kicking out that little brat from the Yan Residence!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Yan Haozheng observed the expressions from the crowd below as he spoke!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Insanity!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Ignorance!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“What could a lowly country folk possibly do to us.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Another man in his 30’s who looked similar to Yan Haozheng was ghostly pale as he clenched both of his fists tightly.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Zhongfeng, do you have anything to say on this matter?” Yan Haozheng titled his head towards his most outstanding, yet very shrewd son.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Father, Yishao has passed away and Yidao has been crippled for the rest of his life. I will tear apart that bastard into pieces. As for that little brat, we shouldn’t have kept her in the first place if this was what was going to happen.” Yan Zhongfeng said furiously.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The relationship between relatives in a large influential clan can be brittle. Even blood-related brothers will seek to kill each other. However, Yan Zhongyue and Yan Zhongfeng were not related by blood. Yan Haozheng and Yan Haoran, on the other hand, were blood-related brothers, but none of that mattered anymore. Would Yan Haozheng even have cared for his brother when he had forced his own father down from authority?</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Do you think you are able to kill him?” Yan Haozheng was still calm, as if he didn’t care for his grandsons.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“He was just a puppet that hadn’t fully grown out his hair. If I cannot win against him, I might as well commit suicide!” Yan Zhongfeng replied without hesitation. He was very furious, since his own son had died and his most outstanding son had become crippled.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Li, what do you think about this!” Yan Haozheng asked the shaky old man at the bottom left corner with great respect.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“We can’t let him go. But there is something fishy about this, yet I don’t know what. I’m getting too old!” The old man shook his head gently.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">A middle-aged man dressed in black came forward to Yan Haozheng and bowed: “I have a message from the Xiao Clan!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">He had been sent by Yan Haozheng to gather a report from the Xiao Clan!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Just report it. With everyone here, I don’t need to repeat the message afterwards.”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Master, this is the reply from the Xiao Clan. They have checked the background of this man. He is the youngest Elder in the Heavenly Palace. They have asked us not to act rashly and alert our opponents. The Xiao Clan has also take on the responsibility to take care of him.” The man dressed in black bowed in front of Yan Haozheng as he relayed his report.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Like a ripple from a tossed stone, the whole meeting room became instantly silent!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Palace was one of the strongest sects in the Greencloud Continent. Moreover, that young man was the youngest Elder of the century. This meant that he had influential support behind his back. Otherwise he wouldn’t have dared to cause a ruckus and say all those things.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“This meeting is adjourned. Nobody shall act recklessly!” Yan Haozheng quickly left as he finished the meeting!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and the others got back to the Lai Residence very quickly. The ground was already covered with a thick layer of snow. Luckily, all of them had cultivated to withstand the snow and cold, including Qing Qing who possessed the power of a Martial Commander Elementary Grade.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">When they reached the main doors to the residence, Lai Chusong and a few men were already at the entrance!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“You are back, sir!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had met with the master of the Lai Clan when he first came over. The refined middle-aged man who spoke to them now was indeed the master of the Lai Clan: Lai Jiutian. He was a martial warrior who was extremely powerful.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Uncle, please just call me Qing Shui. Brother Chusong and I are friends!” Qing Shui said with a smile when he saw the expression on the middle-aged man.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, can we talk?”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gestured his mother, Shi Qingzhuang and Qing Qing to leave first!</p>
  <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, come with me!”</p>
  <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, Lai Chusong, and the other few men followed Lai Jiutian into a pavilion!</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“She is a member of the Qing family. Her surname is Qing, not Yan. She no longer had anything to do with Yan Clan the moment she stepped out from the Yan Residence.” Qing Shui said softly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I won’t kill you so you can relay this back to Yan Clan. The debts from 20 years ago have all been paid. Also, anyone who was involved in kicking out Qing Qing will die, no matter who they are.” Qing Shui then shot out two stones!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Pu pu!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">One stone pierced through Xiao Shao’s head and the other broke the testicles of the young man. One had lost his life, and the other had lost half. He would be crippled for the rest of his life.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Remember, my surname is Qing. They will remember what they did back then if they hear this name!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">After Qing Shui was finished, he went straight to where Qing Yi was!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mother, let’s go back!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Okay!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Yi felt happy, really happy. This would be the happiest day in the past 20 years of her life. At least part of the hollow space in her heart had been filled up once again. However, it pained her to see her apathetic daughter by her side. She has made up her mind to spend the rest of her time and give all her love to Qing Qing. Although it would not compensate for what had happened during those times, Qing Yi could at least feel better about it. &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui looked at Qing Qing who was wearing the fox fur robe they had put on her. His dear sister may be a year older than him, but all he wanted to do now was treat her like a little sister.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Because he wanted to protect her!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Sis… Big Sister!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui stuttered as he shouted! He had to be the one to clear the path to reunite their relationship!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">For now, Qing Yi could not possibly allow her daughter to call her ‘mother’. She couldn’t hope for it! All these years she had never once given her anything but suffering….</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, however, could call her his big sister, and so he did. However, it was difficult to imagine a man stuttering and being so straightforward when he had just displayed the expressions, actions, and words of a murderous man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing stared blankly at the man who had similar features to herself. She nodded on an impulse and said: “You are the man who bought the tea leaves earlier.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui laughed awkwardly and said: “Big sister, let’s go back first. I will explain everything to you later, alright?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Qing nodded her head. Even in this harsh cold weather, she was still calm. Qing Shui wondered, would anyone else except Guo Polu buy the tea leaves she was selling?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui was surprised that the beast car was still in the same spot where they had left. He quickly went inside the car with everyone!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master, take us back to where we came from. Here’s the money!” Qing Shui handed him twice the money he had given him the first time.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Mister, this is too much!” The burly old man quickly said as he drove his car hurriedly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s not easy for an old man like you to drive in this snow-covered land. You deserve it!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">………...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yan Residence!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When Yan Yidao came back, he immediately grabbed everyone’s attention with his disfigured face. A lot of people exclaimed in shock, and soon enough, the news had spread to the elders of the Yan Clan.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">At the same time, the spies of the Yan Clan had reported the incident to Yan Clan master Yan Haozheng! &nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The senior branch of the Yan Clan quickly convened a family meeting. Only the senior branch members would be in the meeting as the other five branches had nearly been annihilated!&nbsp;</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The meeting convened in the big hall!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Hundred of seats had been filled with people who ranged from youngsters to elderly men. The refined man who sat at the head of the table was around his 50s. His hair and brows were all white, but his face was free of wrinkles. The most distinctive feature were his eyes. They looked wise and bright.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He looked like a high-ranking person who wore a yellow brocade robe. The man has a fierce aura that could cut through anyone like a knife, which was why nobody dared to look him in the eyes. This man was the master of the Yan Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yan Haozheng!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Today we have gathered everyone here for the obvious reason. You all should know what has happened earlier. For those who are out of the loop, you may state your questions or ask around right now. Do not take more than 8 minutes!” Yan Haozheng said without much exaggeration.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">However, all the members below were deathly silent. Yan Haozheng nevertheless closed his eyes and waited for the time to go by. When the 8 minutes was up, Yan Haozheng slowly opened his eyes and swept his glance across the hall.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“The people from the Qing Clan came earlier. This is a consequence left by Yan Zhongyue’s unfortunate love from the sixth branch. The man demanded for the debts the Yan Clan has owed to the Qing Clan, as well as the death of those who were involved in the matter of kicking out that little brat from the Yan Residence!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Yan Haozheng observed the expressions from the crowd below as he spoke!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Insanity!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ignorance!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What could a lowly country folk possibly do to us.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">……...</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Another man in his 30’s who looked similar to Yan Haozheng was ghostly pale as he clenched both of his fists tightly.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Zhongfeng, do you have anything to say on this matter?” Yan Haozheng titled his head towards his most outstanding, yet very shrewd son.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Father, Yishao has passed away and Yidao has been crippled for the rest of his life. I will tear apart that bastard into pieces. As for that little brat, we shouldn’t have kept her in the first place if this was what was going to happen.” Yan Zhongfeng said furiously.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The relationship between relatives in a large influential clan can be brittle. Even blood-related brothers will seek to kill each other. However, Yan Zhongyue and Yan Zhongfeng were not related by blood. Yan Haozheng and Yan Haoran, on the other hand, were blood-related brothers, but none of that mattered anymore. Would Yan Haozheng even have cared for his brother when he had forced his own father down from authority?</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Do you think you are able to kill him?” Yan Haozheng was still calm, as if he didn’t care for his grandsons.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“He was just a puppet that hadn’t fully grown out his hair. If I cannot win against him, I might as well commit suicide!” Yan Zhongfeng replied without hesitation. He was very furious, since his own son had died and his most outstanding son had become crippled.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle Li, what do you think about this!” Yan Haozheng asked the shaky old man at the bottom left corner with great respect.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“We can’t let him go. But there is something fishy about this, yet I don’t know what. I’m getting too old!” The old man shook his head gently.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">A middle-aged man dressed in black came forward to Yan Haozheng and bowed: “I have a message from the Xiao Clan!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">He had been sent by Yan Haozheng to gather a report from the Xiao Clan!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Just report it. With everyone here, I don’t need to repeat the message afterwards.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Master, this is the reply from the Xiao Clan. They have checked the background of this man. He is the youngest Elder in the Heavenly Palace. They have asked us not to act rashly and alert our opponents. The Xiao Clan has also take on the responsibility to take care of him.” The man dressed in black bowed in front of Yan Haozheng as he relayed his report.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Like a ripple from a tossed stone, the whole meeting room became instantly silent!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">The Heavenly Palace was one of the strongest sects in the Greencloud Continent. Moreover, that young man was the youngest Elder of the century. This meant that he had influential support behind his back. Otherwise he wouldn’t have dared to cause a ruckus and say all those things.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“This meeting is adjourned. Nobody shall act recklessly!” Yan Haozheng quickly left as he finished the meeting!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui and the others got back to the Lai Residence very quickly. The ground was already covered with a thick layer of snow. Luckily, all of them had cultivated to withstand the snow and cold, including Qing Qing who possessed the power of a Martial Commander Elementary Grade.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">When they reached the main doors to the residence, Lai Chusong and a few men were already at the entrance!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You are back, sir!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui had met with the master of the Lai Clan when he first came over. The refined middle-aged man who spoke to them now was indeed the master of the Lai Clan: Lai Jiutian. He was a martial warrior who was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Uncle, please just call me Qing Shui. Brother Chusong and I are friends!” Qing Shui said with a smile when he saw the expression on the middle-aged man.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, can we talk?”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui gestured his mother, Shi Qingzhuang and Qing Qing to leave first!</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Qing Shui, come with me!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr">Qing Shui, Lai Chusong, and the other few men followed Lai Jiutian into a pavilion!</p>
