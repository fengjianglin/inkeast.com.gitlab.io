 <p><strong>AST 794 - Post-Battle, This Battle Was of Utmost Importance</strong></p>
 <p>The battle ended after only the space of a few breaths. Qing Shui’s Sword of Sixth Wave had completely eliminated his opponents this time. The moment the Sixth Wave was executed, it would instantly kill opponents of a similar level on the spot. The Sixth Wave was much more formidable compared to the Fifth Wave.</p>
 <p>The Fifth Wave was a critical point. For a person of the same strength as the wielder, enduring the Fifth Wave was already the limit. One would even require the protection of external equipment to be just barely withstand the Fifth Wave. The Sixth Wave not only had an additional wave of attack, but also its power was much higher than before. It was already almost unbearable before, so now, this one strike was definitely fatal.</p>
 <p>The ‘Wave Force’ was very powerful but it was also one of the most difficult cultivation arts to cultivate. To be able to unleash the Third Wave was already considered an achievement. Without any absolutely heaven-defying defensive skills, people who met with Qing Shui’s Sixth Wave pretty much had no chance of survival unless their strength was much higher than his.</p>
 <p>On top of that, the Thunderous Beast’s Violet Lightning Strike had crippled one of them beforehand. The Jade Emperor Queen Bee’s strength had also increased by quite a lot after its breakthrough. That elderly man had been pretty unlucky this time. The weaker one’s spirit energy was, the more effective the Jade Emperor Queen Bee’s Poison Killer Sting would be.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Luan Luan’s Earth Devouring Mice were also extremely formidable. They possessed shocking speed and were so terrifying that even Qing Shui was extremely surprised. As soon as she stepped into the Martial Saint realm, Luan Luan’s flock of demonic beasts would be even more powerful.</p>
 <p>From the beginning to the end, the two young men and four elderly men didn’t even get a chance to attack before getting killed on the spot.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, everything was cleared by the flames. Someone also tidied up the area.</p>
 <p>This was less about destroying evidence than just keeping the public square of the Heavenly Palace’s main peak clean.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, now that you have killed them, I’m guessing that we are about to battle the Baima Aristocrat Clan now.” Elder Ge walked over and chuckled.</p>
 <p>“These kinds of people will cause a disaster sooner or later if we leave them alone. This can be considered a warning to some people that the Heavenly Palace isn’t just relying on luck.” Qing Shui laughed leisurely.</p>
 <p>“True. The Baima Aristocrat Clan’s intentions for coming to the Heavenly Palace were nefarious. Such an ending is only befitting of them.” Elder Ge agreed happily after thinking about it.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had a feeling that, very soon, they would no longer be disregarded by the others and that they also wouldn’t need to yield to others either. They would no longer have to live cautiously and could at least vent their frustrations out now. He prayed his strength would breakthrough soon, for Luan Luan to rise through the ranks, and for the rest of the Qing Clan to improve rapidly and steadily.</p>
 <p>Other than that, the Heavenly Palace’s strength had also been improving, especially considering that the ones who had stayed back in the last year were all elites. Although they had been improving very rapidly, it didn’t seem possible that they would be able to become like those supreme sects in the span of a few years or decades. Perhaps he should say that they might never be able to do that.</p>
 <p>Even so, Qing Shui was still very hopeful. Even in the most supreme sects, not everyone in the sect would possess a strength above that of a Peak Martial Saint. On the contrary, these sects still needed a large number of Martial Kings, Peak Martial Kings and Martial Saints for protection.</p>
 <p>This battle had been a joy to Qing Shui. He was able to learn about the average strength of these aristocratic clans through this battle and also learned where he and the Heavenly Palace stood in comparison. It was essential for him to have gone through this battle and later, similar subsequent battles.</p>
 <p>If something like this happened once, it would surely happen again. They had to repeat the ending of the Zuoshi Aristocrat Clan again so that in the future, people who had ill intentions towards the Heavenly Palace would reconsider their choices carefully. Lady Luck would never stay by the side of the same person all the time, so the ending of the Baima Aristocratic Clan was destined to be a tragic.</p>
 <p>“Then let us return first. Elder Ge, I will settle the issue with the Baima Aristocrat Clan.” Qing Shui smiled at Elder Ge.</p>
 <p>“Alright, sure.” Elder Ge waved his hand to show that he didn’t mind.</p>
 <p>“Lass, let’s return to let them know that we are safe and sound.” Qing Shui told Luan Luan who still seemed to be excited.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Luan Luan exclaimed in excitement. This was her first time being involved in a battle of this level. That hot blooded and brutal scene was still deeply imprinted in her heart. She now had an idea on the preparation and methods of the battle experts.</p>
 <p>Speed is a crucial asset in war. Do things in one quick spurt of energy, like a hot knife slicing through the butter.</p>
 <p>She had also gained some knowledge in being a Beast Tamer. As a Beast Tamer, one should continuously adjust and synergize with their demonic beasts in order to achieve the most perfect control. She had observed how Qing Shui’s Thunderous Beast had numbed the elderly man with its Violet Lightning Strike right before Qing Shui had followed up with a Silver Needle that snatched the elderly man’s life away.</p>
 <p>This was a cooperative move. She remembered the Crimson Dragon Bow that Qing Shui had given her before, but she had never gotten a chance to use it. It seemed like she should practice with it more in the future as its decisive far-sighted use in a battle might instantly determine its outcome. Sometimes, things require precise judgement and prediction. If one could accurately predict, then a battle may be shortened and a decisive victory achieved. All this required experience and a keen sense of when to gamble.</p>
 <p>In a Beast Tamer’s battle, the Beast Tamer usually stayed in the center, while being surrounded by their demonic beasts. The demonic beasts by their side were also their guardians. Other than ordering their demonic beasts around, the tamer could also perform some long ranged attacks or study some other battle techniques, like poison arts.</p>
 <p>Although this battle had lasted for a very short time, it had made her understand the methods of battles and allowed her to observe how a true battle was fought. It had also awakened her battle spirit. Her strength in future battles would definitely advance by leaps and bounds, too.</p>
 <p>That was because she possessed the Heart of Seven Orifices that no one else did.</p>
 <p>Bidding their farewell to everyone, Qing Shui and Luan Luan returned to the Qing Residence in the Starmoon Hall. The moment they entered through the front door, the people of Qing Clan were all gathered in the front courtyard. Happy smiles broke across their faces when they saw that Qing Shui had returned. Although they had been pretty sure that nothing would happen to Qing Shui, they had still been worried.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s appearance shocked them. It was too fast! Qing Shui and Luan Luan had come back way too early, so their appearance both surprised and delighted the Qing Clan members.</p>
 <p>They were aware that they had finished off their opponents because they had felt the terrifying Mighty Elephant Stomp from earlier at the main peak. So there was only one possibility - the opponents were taken care of with a single blow.</p>
 <p>“You’ve settled it?” Yiye Jiange asked Qing Shui in shock.</p>
 <p>“Yes I did, but there should still be people coming from the opponent’s side.” Qing Shui looked at Yiye Jiange.</p>
 <p>“Daddy was so impressive. He took care of them all single-handedly!” Luan Luan exclaimed in excitement.</p>
 <p>“That’s enough, lass. Our clan will rely on you very soon.” Qing Shui chuckled. The real meaning behind his sentence was that she would be the leading figure of the next generation. She was extremely vital to the Qing Clan.</p>
 <p>“Daddy promised to bring me to battles and said that I will be of help to him.” Luan Luan looked at Qing Shui excitedly.</p>
 <p>“Our Luan Luan is a good fighter now. I don’t mind bringing you along to battles, but you must listen to me during battles.” Qing Shui smiled at Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>“Yes of course, you are Daddy after all! Of course I will listen to you.” Luan Luan giggled while latching on to Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p>“Let’s return to the big lounge.” Qing Shui announced as he casually scooped up Qing Yin, who had run to his side.</p>
 <p>“Daddy, I want to eat fish. Aunty snatched them all.” Qing Yin complained with a pout.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui looked at the delicate small face of the little lass. He wanted to laugh so badly because she looked like she had been bullied. He uncontrollably gave her a big kiss. “Daddy will make more for you later. Just wait for a little while more.”</p>
 <p>The little lass was very intelligent. She was now able to understand some of the daily conversations and even knew that this man she called her daddy would fulfill any of her wishes. So she would look for Qing Shui every time she ran into something.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui understood that a child’s world was very simple. In every child’s heart, there was a father who was worthy of their greatest admiration. The father an omnipotent figure to them, so as long as anything happened, they’d always look for him and Qing Shui was doing his best in playing his role as a father well.</p>
 <p>“Daddy is the best!” The little lass wrapped her arms around Qing Shui’s neck. Her sweet laughter was extremely melodious.</p>
 <p>“Little Lass, for somebody so young, you are already so good at pleasing others.” Qing Shui laughed happily then looked at Canghai Mingyue, who was beside him. “She’s just like you,” she pointed out softly while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>“This lass is so clever. Of course she’s like me…..” Qing Shui chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Shameless. Lass, look at how thick-faced your daddy is.” Canghai Mingyue laughed at Qing Yin, who was in Qing Shui’s arms, and pinched her little nose.</p>
 <p>“Daddy has a thick face. He’s not afraid of the cold!” Qing Yin pinched Qing Shui’s face with her tiny hands and screamed happily.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui could only laugh along. The little child didn’t know the real meaning. She only knew that anything thick would be warm…...</p>
 <p>Canghai Mingyue praised her daughter’s cleverness as she smiled. Qing Shui’s desire was set ablaze by her elegant smile and her gorgeous face. When his gaze met with Canghai Mingyue, he gave her a look that she could understand. Her face unconsciously turned a faint red.</p>
 <p>She glared at Qing Shui with all her might. Qing Shui only laughed as he held Qing Yin. Canghai Mingyue, on the other hand, didn’t dare to look at Qing Shui in the eyes. There were still other people around, but only two people could tell what was going on through their interactions.</p>
 <p>Huoyun Liu-Li and Di Qing!</p>
 <p>Many people gathered in the big lounge. On top of that, there were little children around, so the atmosphere was very relaxed. Other than Qing Shui, the most powerful people that were gathered here were all women who were related to Qing Shui. Some were even already his women.</p>
 <p>“Qing Shui, are you waiting or going straight to the Baima Aristocrat Clan?” Di Chen came over and sat down beside Qing Shui. Qing Shui was sitting on a three seat beast leather couch. Canghai Mingyue sat on his left while Qing Bei sat on his right. There was a gap between Qing Bei and Qing Shui, so Di Chen was able to fit right in between of them.</p>
 <p>Di Chen only realized that something was off after she took a seat. Only Qing Shui and she knew about the relationship between them. The two of them were already very intimate with each other. They had embraced and kissed each other already, but no outsiders knew that the two of them could basically be considered as being in a committed relationship.</p>
 <p>Perhaps she had done it subconsciously and only realized it after sitting down. A slightly awkward expression showed up on her face. When she saw the teasing look on Qing Shui’s face, she angrily pinched him on his waist.</p>
 <p>Her action had obviously let everyone else know that she was actually Qing Shui’s woman. Di Qing had known about it, but Di Chen had never allowed her to tell anyone, so the others had never been able to confirm it. After all, Qing Shui highly respected this woman. Their relationship was kept very privately to the point that it was impossible for others to tell, even though some had their suspicions.</p>
 <p>Di Chen couldn’t help but blush under everyone’s gaze. Qing Shui, who was just beside her, only looked at her with a smile on his face. It was rare to see her being this shy. This had only happened a few times.</p>
 <p>“Sister Chen, so you and Brother Shui are…” Qing Bei teased Di Chen.</p>
