 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui knew that for the majority of the time, Qin Qing’s face was quite thin. But towards this woman, he tended to feel a bit elusive about her. The Qin Qing he had a deeper impression of was the Qin Qing standing on top of the enormous Green Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Qin Qing was similar to Tantai Lingyan. She gave everyone the feeling that she was a person who wasn’t amenable to reasonings. But now, he realized that it wasn’t necessarily the case. It’s only when she was in a battle that she was similar to his view of her. Normally, she would just be a graceful and subdued woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Qin, what a coincidence, we meet again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A familiar voice came through. Gu Yelong and the people with him sat down at a table near Qing Shui and Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing smiled but didn’t say anything. Qing Shui, on the other hand, despised this kind of shameless people who thought of themselves very highly and always assumed that every single woman would fall for them. He couldn’t help but muttered, “Idiot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui wasn’t loud, but everyone was able to hear what he said. Qin Qing was stunned when she heard what Qing Shui said. She raised the corner of her mouth and looked at Qing Shui with eyes which seemingly looked happy but at the same time also angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Gu Yelong got really upset when he heard what Qing Shui said. But in order to maintain his elegance, he didn’t say anything back to Qing Shui. Though this might be the case, it didn’t mean that the people around Gu Yelong could do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it wasn’t for Miss Qin, I would have torn off your mouth. you impudent bastard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man near Gu Yelong said in an angry tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing`er, it’s almost time. Let’s go and leave those self-righteous idiots alone. Do they really think that anyone would want to stay near them? Qing Shui stood up and said without even batting an eye at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing smiled and nodded as she stood up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yelong was really shocked. Since when had the Miss High and Mighty Qin began to listen so obediently to a man? Since when had she learned to tolerate a man so much?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t move! Have I given you any permissions to leave? Do you really think that you can insult Prince Gu as you please, just because you are under the care of Miss Qin?” The man from before proceeded to shout. At the same time, the aura of a pimp around him could also be felt spreading across the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled, “You are just a dog. What right do you have to randomly bark in front of me? Believe it or not, I am going to break your leg.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are digging your own grave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s body moved and in a flash, he appeared in front of Qing Shui. Before he managed to make his move, however, Qing Shui already lifted up his leg and kicked him out of the way. When that happened, a loud and clear noise of a bone breaking was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fighting noise which came through from here had attracted a lot of people’s attention. They were at the highest floor in the restaurant. The people who could come up to the highest floor were only warriors. And for warriors, the most enjoyable thing for them would be to have the chance to see others fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man who got kicked fainted. Qing Shui acted like nothing happened as he glared at Gu Yelong who was standing opposite him, “I will kill whoever set their sights on my woman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing shot a glare at Qing Shui. But she didn’t say anything. Qing Shui on the other hand, acted like nothing happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really expect me to let someone go after hitting my people so easily? Whatever he lost, you are going to suffer the same. If you agree to that, I will spare your life.” Gu Yelong replied in a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know what I hate the most?” Qing Shui smiled and looked at Gu Yelong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before Gu Yelong managed to say anything, Qing Shui continued on and said, “Fake people like you. You don’t even have the ability to get a woman pregnant. I don’t have time to play around with you. Go away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing stared blankly at Qing Shui. At this moment, her impression of Qing Shui was that he was nothing but a really vulgar man. Qing Shui smiled. Standing in front of hypocrites like Gu Yelong who always liked acting elegant, Qing Shui couldn’t have found anything more enjoyable than acting like a gangster in front of him. It would be even more fun if Gu Yelong started acting like a gangster in return as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You vulgar man… You lack the basic essence which a man should have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you also this elegant when you are being tortured by Ying Ya`er?” Qing Shui chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this, when Qing Shui left, he heard people mentioning that Ying Ya`er was waiting for Prince Gu tonight. That was why Qing Shui mentioned about it just now. He did it all just to embarrass Gu Yelong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are babbling out nonsense! I don’t know anyone called Ying Ya`er!” Gu Yelong’s face turned red and shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I look like I care whether you know her or not? Qing`er, let’s go. To think that a guy with erectile problems would still want to play with women, he must be bored to the point where he doesn’t know what else he can do.” Qing Shui was talking to himself towards the end. Despite that, everyone around him was still able to hear what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, does Prince Gu really have erectile problem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. Before this, I think I have heard a woman from Wind Whistling Pavilion mentioning about it before. But for some unknown reasons, she died soon after she said it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Without wind, there cannot be waves. This statement might be true.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qin Qing was unable to stay here any longer and decided to walk out. But suddenly, Gu Yelong’s figure appeared at the staircase and stood in the way of Qing Shui and Qin Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Insulting people has its cost.” Gu Yelong’s face was bursting with anger. At this point, he was already feeling extremely furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From other’s perspectives, however, his anger came from shame. Initially, Qing Shui never intended to talk about a person’s testes. The only mistake Gu Yelong made was having ideas about Qing Shui’s woman. He then made matters worse by intending to step on Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Insulting? &nbsp;In the middle third of every month, your testes will hurt for up to half a day. What else do you have to say? Oh, I almost forgot, I am a physician, more commonly known as the Miraculous Physician.” Qing Shui left the spot with Qin Qing, leaving the stunned Gu Yelong behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing a person or beating him up might not necessarily be the most satisfying way to punish a person. The best way to do it was by making him feel despair.&nbsp;</span></p>

Aren’t you afraid of Gu Clan giving you trouble?” Qin Qing shook her head and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well, they had their sights fixed on my woman. Just with that, it has already made your statement invalid even if he had been an emperor or an old man.” Qing Shui said in a way which seemed like he was feeling indignant at an injustice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You impudent brat. Are you trying to dig a grave for yourself? Since when have I become your woman?” An angry Qin Qing landed a light punch on Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

It’s still really early now. Rest assured, I am going to fight hard for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing decided to move away from this topic. She knew that they would only start talking further and further ahead if they continued to dwell into this topic, “Let’s head back. We have already arranged a room for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where do you live?” Qing Shui was a bit awkward when he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will live on separate floors.” Qin Qing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, and here I thought I would be living with you. That had given me quite a shock as I am not ready to do so just yet.” Qing Shui let out a sigh of relief like he just dropped down a huge burden in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing was shaken. She felt a strong urge to punch his face but in the end, she still managed to withstand her desire to do it. She wasn’t actually mad. Though she might be extremely annoyed with it, somehow, she still felt a kind of happiness which words couldn’t describe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was precisely what Qing Shui wanted. To leave a deep impression on this woman, he had tried using a lot of ways to communicate with her, even if it meant acting like a gangster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Qing might be unmatched in terms of her beauty in her generation, but she wasn’t just a stationary vase as well. Prior to this, when she heard the things which Qing Shui said to her grandpa, she came to understand that Qing Shui was doing all of this for her. Though she might look mad, deep down, she was actually happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you angry?” Qing Shui asked gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew my Qin`er wouldn’t be so narrow-minded.” Qing Shui said in a certain tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, Qin Qing had finally came to understand that little by little, the impudent Qing Shui was making his way up the stick like a snake, and now, she had somehow ended up a family member of his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned to Qin King Manor, Qing Shui was arranged in the courtyard where Qin Qing lived in. The courtyard wasn’t that big, but it looked really unique. There was only a building in the courtyard. It consisted of three floors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The floor was light pink in color and looked really exquisite. Night time had already approached; while walking, Qin Qing said, “Your room is on the second floor. Let me show you the way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui smiled as he followed her up to the second floor. The first floor only had two rooms. One was larger than the other. However, the beds in both rooms were double beds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The room might not be that big, but it felt really warm. Though it might not be strong, the room was filled with fragrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Qing Shui’s eyes, the snow white blanket on the bed was more seducing than ever before. Qin Qing could see a kind of passion filling up Qing Shui’s eyes, hence, she said gently, “The sky is turning dark, let’s go and have some rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Qin Qing finished speaking, she turned around and started to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, it’s was if Qing Shui couldn’t control himself and went on to grab her hand. He gently pulled her towards himself and embraced her in his arms. He was getting ready to kiss her cherry lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You never loved me!” Qin Qing said gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words made Qing Shui feel as if a bucket of cold water was poured on him in the winter. During this time, the sexy lips of the woman were slightly apart. He could smell the fresh breath coming from her mouth very clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am sorry for not controlling myself…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a bit late now, go have some rest. Goodnight.” Qin Qing smiled and said gently. Seeing Qing Shui’s lonely expression, she extended her hand and rubbed Qing Shui’s head before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was a bit speechless. He immediately entered the bathroom and took a shower. For now, he decided to leave the matter regarding Qin Qing aside and began thinking about Gu Yelong. Since he exposed the embarrassing things about him, it’s safe to assume that Gu Clan would look for him to settle the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Qing Shui thought, Gu Clan made their move very quickly. On the following day, words were spread to the public that Gu Clan wanted Qin King Manor to hand over Qing Shui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had found out that Qing Shui was just a man whom Qin Qing brought back with her. As to whether he was Qin Qing’s husband, they were still uncertain about it. It’s likely that Qin King Manor wouldn’t reject Gu Clan’s request just for a brat like Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Gu Clan was also very polite to the people from Qin King Manor. The only problem was that they never expected for Qin King Manor to reject their request so straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui had once again embarrassed Gu Clan. Though this time, Gu Yelong might have been the one to make the mistakes. Qing Shui didn’t hold back and exposed him in front of everyone. This has caused Gu Clan to lose a great deal of face. They then proceeded to ask for Qing Shui from Qin King Manor only to get rejected by them again. This caused them to lose face yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Clan couldn’t stand constantly being mocked by Qing Shui. After all, it was supposed to still be more powerful than Qin King Manor. But its strength lied solely on the number of members in its clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Qin King manor didn’t give them face, Gu Clan felt that it’s needed for them to fight for it themselves. It’s certainly not possible that Gu Clan would immediately make their way to Qin King Manor since they shared a good relationship with the royal clans. Out of all the clans, the royal clan remained one of the most mysterious ones. No one was clear as to how many strong experts were hidden within their clan. For a clan that was capable of conquering the dynasty, it would certainly not be as simple as it looked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Clan sent Qin King Manor a challenge letter. Initially, the relationship between the two clans were already in quite a bad situation, but now, Gu Clan sent out their challenge letter for Qin Royalty asking to either hand over Qing Shui or accept the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin King Manor would be considered to have lost if they didn’t accept either one of the options. Hence, the only option left for them would be to take the challenge which was a wheel match. Both sides must battle until one side admitted defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the scheme planned by Gu Clan. After all, Gu Clan wouldn’t gain any advantages with a one-on-one battle. That was why they decided to go for a tag match instead. Gu Clan had a lot of experts in them. Their sole motive was to beat Qin King Manor no matter what it took.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui was reluctant to let Qin King Manor be defeated and thus, he decided to settle this matter himself. However, Old Man Qin rejected it because doing that would mean that Qing Shui looked down upon Qin King Manor. Hence, Qing Shui had no choice but to agree to it but only under one condition, which is, he must be the representative for the first match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tag match is one where the warrior would be able to continue fighting in the arena given that they win their matches.&nbsp;</span></p>
