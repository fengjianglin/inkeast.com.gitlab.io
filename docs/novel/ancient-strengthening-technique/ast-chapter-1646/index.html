 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui did not seem to have slept, after all he had only just regained consciousness. After his strength was raised, his constitution became even stronger such that it would not be much of a problem even if he did not sleep for a long period of time. However, the sky only started to break and the doors of his chambers opened as his two women blinked sleepily and walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were only wearing pyjamas which were rather spacious and gave off an air of indolence. Their fringes were in a mess but it did not seem to affect their beauty, and instead added to their charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Qing Shui, both women smiled and went to wash up. Once they finished washing and dressing up, Qing Shui was already cleaned up. As he didn’t sleep, he simply washed his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both the women went to do their morning exercises and Qing Shui followed suit. The Divine Moon Immortal Sect’s land was vast and the plaza was filled with a great many people doing their morning exercises. These people belonged to the Divine Moon Immortal Sect and now the Sect was very peaceful after the Life-or-Death Battle that had happened previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them found a more secluded spot that prevented people from disturbing them. Everybody knew that Qing Shui and the two women were not to be trifled with. After all, the Hong Clan was a great example of what would happen if they were to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was such a long time and the surrounding people saw Qing Shui appear for the first time. Some envied his indomitable life spirit but were even more envious of the two kingdom-toppling beauties by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a while since he did some exercises, which was why Qing Shui liked to exercise for a bit now. The breakthrough from his drastic increase in strength this time did not cause any discordance with his body, but breaking through to Divine would also resolve the minor imbalances from these small problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divinity Spirit allowed Qing Shui’s Heavenly Dao to experience a qualitative leap. In the instant that Qing Shui felt as if he surpassed life and death did his Heavenly Dao also undergo a major breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taichi Fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s mastery of Taichi Fist now was unknown to him, but he long knew that he had attained the realm which disregarded form or intention. Now, his every single blow seemed to exude the rules of the Heavenly Dao, which was a kind of formless pressure. Each move and each stroke was so simple yet it carried an overbearing pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui’s face bore a satisfied expression and not long later, he saw that Yin Tian and Feng Xi had also arrived. They were also practising Taichi Fist. Previously, Yin Tian was stunned when he saw Qing Shui’s fist techniques as it had actually reached such a level of mastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui, both his women greeted Yin Tian and Feng Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tian’s Taichi Fist cultivation did not raise by much, these few days he was fretting a lot over Qing Shui’s injury and had no mood to train. Now that his mood was better, he resumed cultivation. Even though he stopped cultivation for a bit previously, his body was maintaining its recovery process during the past fifty days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After finishing his breakfast, Qing Shui helped Yin Tian with a round of Constitution Nurturing and stimulated his potential. After that, he used the Five Elements Divine Needles to help recuperate his viscera.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doctors do not treat themselves. Previously, Qing Shui suffered an injury but was unable to treat himself - no matter the difficulties, they were unable to treat themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this, more than half the day went by and Yin Tian’s body underwent a huge improvement this time. Now, he had nearly recovered to Peak False God. But even then, he still required two months or more to fully recover, unless he managed to cultivate his mastery of the Taichi Fist past the Grand Perfection stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Tian’s mastery of Taichi was now only at the Small Perfection stage, but even this would benefit him a lot. Taichi’s ability to nourish one’s health and cultivate the body was incomparable. To understand Taichi’s true essence, Yin Tian did not require treatment from Qing Shui and he would gradually recover anyway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some things did not need to be said but instead allow one to come to an understanding on one’s own. If he were to tell him, then he would forever find it difficult to come to an understanding. Qing Shui would also use Taichi to spar with Yin Tian and let him try to experience it for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The time now passed leisurely for Qing Shui. Yin Tian’s body was in the process of recovering and the Divine Moon Immortal Sect’s problems were more or less resolved, but there was still the Blade Demon Immortal Sect. When they came back and killed the Blade Demon and some of the Sect’s people, they were unsure of how the Divine Moon Immortal Sect would deal with the Blade Demon Immortal Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blade Demon Immortal Sect and Divine Moon Immortal Sect were the two largest sects in this region. The Blade Demon Immortal Sect had always wanted to exterminate the Divine Moon Immortal Sect in order to take control of the best resources this region had to offer for themselves. However while the idea was good, the reality was cruel. So much time had passed and there was no idea what the Blade Demon Immortal Sect was up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the contrary, the Blade Demon Immortal Sect were actually much more at peace now with the Hong Clan gone. The Blade Demon Immortal Sect without the Hong Clan was actually considered a significant loss of strength. Of course, this wasn’t including the fact that Qing Shui was someone on an entirely different level, the Blade Demon Immortal Sect would not know of Qing Shui’s current strength increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was because of this, Yin Tian and Feng Xi did not raise the matter of the Blade Demon Immortal Sect, as if they had forgotten about it. Qing Shui certainly wasn’t going to interfere with Divine Moon Immortal Sect’s affairs and although he was on good terms with them, he was here to treat Yin Tian’s injury after all. As for anything else, he wasn’t interested in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time he didn’t care if he came for nothing, moreover the him now had already taken a big step forward into this circle and stepped onto this platform. This step he took was very big and he felt very happy about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui brought Tantai Lingyan and Qin Qing to take a look at the surrounding environment of Divine Moon Immortal Sect. The scenery and environs were the most beautiful he had come across. The deeper one headed into Haohan Continent the more beautiful it would be, but it was also more vicious and dangerous. Of course normal human beings were always going to be the most, it was like how humans would not feel anything upon seeing an ant nor if they were to step on it. But it would be different if it were a rabbit and much less needs to be said if it was a person who wanted to snatch his things or his women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like here, the Divine Moon Immortal Sect would not monitor most people - common folk, but would definitely pay close attention to the Blade Demon Immortal Sect or any abrupt appearance of a strong clan. The Blade Demon Immortal Sect were also the same, otherwise what occurred when they came back would not have happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The threat of benefits, caused by competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui now possessed attention grabbing power, therefore casually heading towards the depths of Haohan Continent would surely be watched by others. While he surely would head there, it wouldn’t be right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them rode the Hellfire Phoenix with both women sitting on each side and looking into the distance. Seeing the rivers and mountains below them, they were standing high above and could see far so their heroic pride would would also rise. The feeling of overlooking felt very good, at least it was much better than looking up and they felt much better in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of them was a vast and endless plain with dense brushes that were waist high and trees would now and then rise above the profusion of vegetation. They were very sporadic and basically it would be a long distance before they saw another tree. The trees very sturdy but not extremely tall. This was because it was adapting to the sudden winds of the vast plain, too tall and the tree would be uprooted and blown away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his previous life, Qing Shui did not go to any vast plains and only saw it on the television. While this wasn’t the first one he saw in this world, the scenery in front of him right now was breathtaking and boundless, and with two beauties as his companions right now, what more could he ask for?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Occasionally, some wild beasts could be seen roaming the wild plains, and some might beast roars could even be heard; flocks of birds flew past from time to time as well. The wild beasts and flying beasts here were innumerable, and it was a scene that flourished with boundless vitality that made anyone who looked at it feel very comfortable.</span></p>

Actually he already saw some streams and lakes previously but they could not compare to the one right before him. It wasn’t very big or small, but the lake was crystal clear and glistened while the spiritual qi seemed to be in abundance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This lake was approximately oval in shape, and length wise about tens of miles and breadth wise about six to seven miles. On the banks of the lake were several trees and its surroundings were dense brushes, but what made Qing Shui surprised was that there was not a single flying beast that came here to drink water. It was a really peculiar place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streams and lakes that they came across before this was filled with flying beasts that came down to drink water but it was completely silent here which led Qing Shui to guess that if the water wasn’t poisoned then it was the presence of beasts in the water.</span></p>

It was blocked by the trunk of a tree earlier and thus he did not notice it. Since he saw it now, he decided to take a look and leave the two women on his Hellfire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Shui, then you have to be careful!”</span></p>

As for the sea creatures that dwelled in the water, there was probably no way for them to leave this place so they gradually got used to living here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui walked in the front of the stone tablet and was taken aback by the words inscribed on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entrance of the North Ocean!</span></p>

The World of the Nine Continents has the four major Ocean Domains and the Nine Continents Star Ocean Domain etc, these were terrifying existences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

He was holding a giant golden trident and his features resembled that of humans, with the only difference being that of his head which looked somewhat like that of a prawn head. Moreover, Qing Shui had seen the pictures of their race before and they were equal existences to the Ancient Battle King Crabs. This Ancient Golden Shrimp General and the Golden Battle King Crab were of similar existences, perhaps even surpassing it. But at this point Qing Shui was much stronger than before and yet the being that was guarding the Entrance of the North Ocean did not seem the least bit worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you thinking of doing at the Entrance of the North Ocean?” A sonorous voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I merely came here for a stroll and get some fresh air, surely there’s no need to be this fierce? En, that’s right Brother, if this is the Entrance of the North Ocean, can I get to North Ocean Domain from here?” Qing Shui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">North Ocean Domain entrances were plenty and North Ocean Domain could also be entered from the sky but it was extremely difficult. The safest way was to enter from elsewhere and even the Aquatics’ strongest existences could not be complacent in this uncharted Ocean Domain. If you were unlucky then you would be exterminated by some unknown Ancient Demon Kings. There were also Ancient Dragons etc which could not be measured by normal convention - they lived for far too long and the strength of their body was truly terrifying.</span></p>
