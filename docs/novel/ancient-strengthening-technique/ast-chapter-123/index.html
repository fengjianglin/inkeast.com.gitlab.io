  <p><strong>AST 0123 – Wenren Wu-shuang!</strong></p>
  <p>“I forgot about it. I had thought of you as a person who was no longer required to feast on the food of mortals. How about you go create a fishpond, and I’ll send some over. Whenever you guys feel like eating, they would be freely accessible. It’s also more convenient.” Qing Shui was a bit embarrassed as he looked at Wenren Wu-shuang.</p>
  <p>“You’re getting naughtier, mmm, you’re getting better at coaxing people too!” Wenren Wu-shuang seemed to be in a good mood, as she started to talk nonsense with Qing Shui!</p>
  <p>“It’s the house in front.” After walking for a short distance, Wenren Wu-shuang looked in the distance and spoke.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui followed the gaze of Wenren Wu-shuang. It was a three story high silvery-white pavilion, and it seemed very elegant compared to the houses surrounding it!</p>
  <p>“Alright, I won’t be accompanying you in. You go in and take a look yourself!” Wenren Wu-shuang smiled, and stopped in her tracks when they reached the entrance.</p>
  <p>“Why, are you afraid that I have evil designs?” Qing Shui’s amused gaze landed on Wenren Wu-shuang’s butt as he remembered the charming sight in the pool of the Night Fragrance Court: the mesmerizing scene of the beautiful snow-white butt when it was bent over.</p>
  <p>“You rascal, what kind of look are you making?” Wenren Wu-shuang said in annoyance, her cheeks were dyed red.</p>
  <p>“Then you should just accompany this man who has taken so many of your first times.” Qing Shui gathered his courage, tugged her soft hands and led her in .</p>
  <p>Qing Shui only felt the softness of the small hand. It was gentle and exquisite, as if were soft jade, and carried a slight cooling sensation amidst the scorching summer. It was very comfortable.</p>
  <p>“Mmm, why are you being such a rascal… What do you mean taken a lot of my first times?” Wenren Wu-shuang’s makeup-free face blushed.</p>
  <p>“I’m the first man to hug you, to help you undress, mmm, and I should be the first to touch that part of your body…”</p>
  <p>“Stop it!” Wenren Wu-shuang turned and used her other hand to cover Qing Shui’s mouth. Moisture flickered in her beautiful eyes, making her seemed pitiful.</p>
  <p>“I’m sorry, I only wanted to make you happy. I like seeing the look you have when you are smiling gently, when you are smiling shyly, and even the cute look when you’re embarrassed. While I’m lecherous, I would never think of harming you.” Qing Shui slowly took off the hand that was covering his mouth, and letting go of her other hand concurrently.</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang looked at Qing Shui seriously. “You’re still young. You may be mesmerized by me now, or you may even like me and will treat me well. However, I can feel that you may not be thinking solely about me in your heart. There seems to be other women in your heart whom you think more of.”</p>
  <p>At that moment, Qing Shui was a bit stunned. A woman’s intuition is so strong. There was Shi Qingzhuang in his heart whom he couldn’t let go of, and he even thought of only being with Shi Qingzhuang, yet he still could not let go of Wenren Wu-shuang as well.</p>
  <p>“Alright, you don’t have to blame yourself. I’m very happy, and can feel your intentions. You are not like the other guys who merely wish to possess. Qing Shui, let’s just let nature take its course. Now you should be doing the things you should be focusing on, and not drown in female companionship too early, otherwise your training could be greatly affected.” Wenren Wu-shuang recovered her usual graceful and matured look, smiling to show her concern.</p>
  <p>“Thank you, but I think it’s already hard for me to drown in female companionship now.” Qing Shui smiled at Wenren Wu-shuang gently.</p>
  <p>“You are not a devoted person. Don’t think that I don’t know that you seem to have some relationship with the one from Shi Clan, as well as the one from Yu He Inn. They are upper class ladies of Hundred Miles City, and both of them are top beauties. But what I do not understand, is that your targets always seem to be older than you, and they need to be at least women with a fiance!” Wenren Wu-shuang looked at Qing Shui seriously.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui stared stunned at Wenren Wu-shuang, feeling very stuffed inside. To think that he was being seen as a person with special preferences. Thinking back on the Warring States of his previous life, all the big shots seemed to like other’s wives. Out of their 12 wives, 10 of them were snatched from others. Now, he had become someone who not only snatched from others, but also showed interest towards women who had be taken by other men.</p>
  <p>“Do you like to snatch other’s women, and do you like mature women who have had men before, preferably widows?” Before Qing Shui could counter, he was made speechless from Wenren Wu-shuang’s words.</p>
  <p>“Where did you hear this?” Qing Shui asked Wenren Wu-shuang, perplexed.</p>
  <p>“Sister said that out of 10 men, there would be at least 6 who like mature women, and at least 8 who like pretty widows. I end up realizing that you fit the bill very well.” After saying this, Wenren Wu-shuang blinked her pretty eyes.</p>
  <p>“What is this? You have been led astray by your sister. Did your sister also tell you that men like ladies who are lewd in bed more, especially those who are more proactive?” Qing Shui said weakly.</p>
  <p>“I forbid you to say such lewd things!” Wenren Wu-shuang replied in annoyance.</p>
  <p>“Alright, alright, only you are allowed to say, I’m not. Let’s go in to take a look at the house first!” Qing Shui pulled Wenren Wu-shuang and entered the wide red wooden door!</p>
  <p>The house only took up a space of 1.5 mu, and was considered small. However, considering that it was in a prosperous area in Hundred Miles City, it was a good find. The courtyard was spacious, with a small flower bed, and even a small pond for one to rear fish. The house was brand new, with nothing inside, but it would be fine after getting some furniture and a bed. The house was fully decorated, and could immediately house people.</p>
  <p>“Are you satisfied?” Wenren Wu-shuang allowed Qing Shui to hold on to her hands, and seeing that Qing Shui was looking at it seriously, she could not help but ask.</p>
  <p>“Satisfied, very satisfied! It wouldn’t be bad to continue like this!”</p>
  <p>Hearing Qing Shui’s words that did not make sense, Wenren Wu-shuang looked at Qing Shui, puzzled. “What wouldn’t be bad if it continued?”</p>
  <p>“I really think that to grab onto your hands like this until the day we die is not bad!” Qing Shui spoke in a soft voice, and clenched on tightly to Wenren Wu-shuang’s hand.</p>
  <p>Wenren Wu-shuang’s heart trembled as if it had been nudged gently after hearing Qing Shui’s words. She looked at Qing Shui’s elegant face that tended to make one forget his age, as well as the pretty eyes which had a slightly masculine aggressive charm, and had the farsightedness to see through a lot of things.</p>
  <p>After a night of training, Qing Shui felt that he had improved quite a lot. Now, Qing Shui had felt that everything was increasingly falling into its place, as his life was mundane, but stable.</p>
  <p>It was rare that that morning, all the members of the Qing Clan in Hundred Miles City were present. Even Qing Zi had rushed back to Hundred Miles City. A few days earlier he was still at the Qing village, discussing with the Feng Clan that they would be holding the wedding in Hundred Miles City.</p>
  <p>After a lively meal, Qing Shui called back Qing You, Qing Hu, Qing Bei, and Little Fatty!</p>
  <p>“Brother Shui, is it that you have things for us to do?” Qing Bei asked, smiling.</p>
  <p>After all, everyone in Qing Clan who either had nothing to do, or were not too busy would all be helping to prepare for Qing Zi’s wedding. This was the wedding of Qing Clan’s eldest grandson, and they had to make it a glorious affair.</p>
  <p>“I’ve gotten a house, this is the key. You guys go get some furniture later!” Qing Shui smiled as he handed the money and key to Qing Bei, before telling them the address.</p>
  <p>“Oh, the house is ready!” Qing Bei received the items happily.</p>
  <p>“Qing Bei, ask Brother Zi what kind of furniture our future sister-in-law likes before you buy anything!” Qing Shui instructed Qing Bei. The rest were all uncouth fellows, and would be better off acting as bodyguards.</p>
  <p>Qing Shui remembered that they should start preparing the wedding invites soon. Who should they invite?</p>

 <p>“I’ve gotten a house, this is the key. You guys go get some furniture later!” Qing Shui smiled as he handed the money and key to Qing Bei, before telling them the address.</p>
 <p>“Oh, the house is ready!” Qing Bei received the items happily.</p>
 <p>“Qing Bei, ask Brother Zi what kind of furniture our future sister-in-law likes before you buy anything!” Qing Shui instructed Qing Bei. The rest were all uncouth fellows, and would be better off acting as bodyguards.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui remembered that they should start preparing the wedding invites soon. Who should they invite?</p>
