 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of explosive sounds rang out up above and air currents gushed through the sky. It was a pity for the Dark Phoenix that his opponent had only been inflicted with some minor injuries. The Dark Phoenix was very resistant toward attacks, but his attacking prowess wasn't that high. However, while in the Nine Phantom condition, its attack still wasn't considered bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The result of the battle was decided. The battle had ended. Qing Shui didn't leave any of them alive. The old man had taken his own life while the other two had been killed by Long Zhu`er and by Qing Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect lost three powerful cultivators. Plus the ones from before, they had really lost a lot. Right now, the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect wasn't only at the level of suffering from fractures or pulled muscles. Their situation could be compared to having lost an arm or something that was even more serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Sha, Qingfeng, Mingyue and the others hadn't taken part in this fight. When Qing Shui came down, when he saw their agitated expressions, he smiled, "Aunt Feng, thankfully we managed to tide through this."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Feng Xi was so happy that her feelings couldn't be described using words. She reached out her hand to pat Qing Shui on the shoulder, unable to say anything. She wasn't the only one like this. Even Yin Tian and Old Wang were the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because they knew that it would be too excessive for them to offer their thanks. In such a situation, saying thanks wasn't enough for them to express themselves. Therefore, it was better off for them to not say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan looked at Qing Shui and smiled happily with a soft gaze, "Did you get hurt?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui went up to embrace Tantai Lingyan. When everyone saw this couple, they really thought that the two of them were a match made in heaven, and were looking at them with warm smiles. They hoped from the bottom of their hearts that Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan would be the most blissful they could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How could I? Your husband's body is very strong." Qing Shui whispered to her ears softly and said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan had been with Qing Shui for a long time and knew that this guy must have a hidden meaning behind his words. However, it was in moments like this that she felt happier. It meant that he was really fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"They know that you're my husband. There's no need to keep re-emphasizing it." Tantai Lingyan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm not saying this for them. Be good, come, call me husband." Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many of Qing Shui's women knew this address and what it meant. [1] Qing Shui had been to a lot of places in this world, but hadn't heard of anyone using the exact same term.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Cut that out, or else, I'll beat you." Tantai Lingyan said in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hitting someone means that you care for them. There's no need to go to the trouble. Just a kiss will do." Qing Shui enjoyed the warmth between them now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, they're all around. Be good." Tantai Lingyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her tone, as if she was pacifying a child, seemed to have an amazing charm. Qing Shui was stunned for a moment and then broke out into a smile and whispered next to her ear, "In the future, when we have a kid of our own, I must have a look at the sight of you carrying the kid. It'll definitely be very beautiful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan's heart skipped a beat and she pushed away Qing Shui, a face a little flushed. She glared at Qing Shui and walked over to Feng Xi, feeling embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Did he bully you? Let Godmother stand up for you." Feng Xi smiled and asked Tantai Lingyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aunt Feng, I can't bear to bully her. Let's head back first." Qing Shui proposed. They had been standing here for very long and there were already people who had started to clean up the scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had any objections. Feng Xi waved toward the people from the Divine Moon Immortal Sect who were in the surrounding, indicating for them to be dispersed. This battle had raised the morale of the people from the Divine Moon Immortal Sect by a lot and they were now full of confidence in life. Earlier, they had to put in a lot of determination to decide to stay. It hadn't been that easy. Right now, not even 1% of the Divine Moon Immortal Sect's members had stayed. 99% of them had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still quite a number of them who had stayed since the massive Divine Moon Immortal Sect had quite a large number of members. Even 1% of them all was still a considerable number. These were the core disciples and those who could stay, would further become the greater core members amongst the core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans needed hope. Without hope, all would be gloomy; with hope, it was as if there was a sun and the entire world would become slightly brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the day, lively and happy sounds came from the Divine Moon Immortal Sect. The people who had came from the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect had basically all died. However, Qing Shui guessed that there might have been two or three of them who had managed to return to the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect to give their reports.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui washed up and then since it was about time, everyone had their meal together. This time around, they didn't say anything about the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect anymore and purely had their meal. It was because, right now, Qing Shui was the only one who could handle the situation. All the rest of them weren't strong enough. Since they didn't have the capability, then there wasn't a need for them to bring up the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meal ended very quickly. After they were done with their meal, Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan took their leave. Time was getting increasingly precious as no one knew what would happen next. This time was what Qing Shui had fought for them, and it was extremely precious. All the others knew that right now, Qing Shui and Tantai Lingyan didn't wish to be disturbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This matter shouldn't be over yet. Qing Shui, I'm very worried." Tantai Lingyan walked next to Qing Shui as they headed back to their place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Shui took her warm hand and shook his head, "You must be confident in your man."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'm being serious. Can you be a little more serious?" Tantai Lingyan said angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Earlier on, that old man said that he is from the top three in the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect. I don't know if he's the third, but he's definitely not the first. Therefore, the Demonic Saber Immortal Sect definitely still have other experts. However, they might not necessarily come." Qing Shui gave it some thought and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Demonic Saber Immortal Sect's losses are considered to be great as well. Would they be willing to bear with this loss?" Tantai Lingyan shook her head, disagreeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's never too late for a gentleman to seek revenge after ten years. These people aren't gentlemen and thus it wouldn't be considered long even if they were to come back 800 or even 1,000 years later. I won't be surprised even if they don't seek revenge either. They still have their family. The more the situation turned out like this, the more they wouldn't be willing to risk it. It's because if they end up losing, they would lose everything. What do you think?" Qing Shui smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tantai Lingyan was a little stunned. She thought of herself and the Five Tiger Immortal Sect. It had been so many years.Although she knew that the Five Tiger Immortal Sect was involved, if she were to go now, she'd be courting death. Therefore, it wasn't an intelligent decision. Moreover, she now had a little bit more things that she was concerned about.</span></p>

Moreover, in most situations, people wouldn't bring the family into the picture. This is especially when they aren't clear of the situation yet. If required, yes, it makes sense to get rid of everyone completely, removing even the roots. If I'm not dead, then they wouldn't be that foolish to try to wipe out the Divine Moon Immortal Sect."

He didn't feel any greed, but there was love that was deep as the ocean, seeping right down to his bones. Tantai Lingyan felt a little uneasy when Qing Shui was looking at her like this.</span></p>
