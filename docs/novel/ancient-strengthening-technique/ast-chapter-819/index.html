 <p><strong>AST 819 - Recipe for Du Meridian Strengthening Pill</strong></p>
 <p>It was possible to first let Luan Luan and her demonic beasts power up. In any case, there was no need to get panicky over the Fate Pills, as there were still the Everlasting Pellet, Beauty Pellet, Great Revitalizing Pellet and other pills.</p>
 <p>He had already taken one or two of these pills, however there were many that he had not taken. In the past he had felt that his strength was weak, and taking the pills then would be a waste. Currently, Qing Shui had also got over it. He would raise hi strength as much as he could, as he would not lack pills in the future.</p>
 <p>“Father!” Luan Luan shouted happily as she came to Qing Shui’s side.</p>
 <p>“Lass, circulate your cultivation technique first and restore your body to its optimum condition.” Qing Shui said as he smiled towards Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan replied with a single word and started to circulate her cultivation technique. As her big beautiful eyes faintly closed, Qing Shui could feel the changes in the flow of qi within her body.</p>
 <p>“Lass, consume this. After that, don’t think about anything else. Just rapidly circulate your cultivation technique and it’ll be alright.” said Qing Shui as he passed the Fate Pill over.</p>
 <p>Upon receiving it, Luan Luan immediately swallowed it down, before sitting down cross legged on the fighting platform in the backyard. In accordance to Qing Shui’s words, she rapidly revolved her Xiantian qi along her body’s meridians.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui faintly closed his eyes as he spread his Spiritual sense out. Luan Luan’s meridians distinctly appeared in his mind, as a powerful energy rose from her Dantian and rapidly spread to her meridians.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan’s body uncontrollably trembled, as the circulating Xiantian Qi suddenly accelerated. Her meridians grew taut all of a sudden, causing her to grit her teeth in pain.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui slowly opened his eyes and saw that Luan Luan’s complexion had already turned scarlet red in color. Extending his hand, a gold needle was inserted into her Tianjing acupuncture point, blocking the violent aura.</p>
 <p>Temporary strengthening of the meridians!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui’s acupuncture technique was deep and profound. With just a single needle, Luan Luan was able to feel a cool and refreshing aura flow through her meridians, allowing her originally scorching hot meridians to calm and cool down.</p>
 <p>In approximately less than a incense worth of time, Luan Luan’s complexion had again turned scarlet red. However Qing Shui did not move. When it reached an incense worth of time, Luan Luan’s entire neck had also turned scarlet red. At this moment, Qing Shui once again inserted needles to her Tianchi and Tianquan acupuncture points.</p>
 <p>Just like that, Qing Shui would insert needles once in awhile. This was the aftereffects of a strong medicine. Ordinary people were unable to use such heavenly treasures or heaven defying medicine, as they could easily explode and die.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan’s talent was unique and profound, yet he still had to use nine needles. After the ninth needle, the energy within Luan Luan’s body stabilized. What she needed to do now was to refine that energy and turn it into her own strength.</p>
 <p>What Qing Shui needed to do now was just not let anyone disturb Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>In less than an hour, Luan Luan opened her eyes and felt a wave of surprise. Upon seeing Qing Shui faintly smiling at her, she happily leaped toward him and hugged him.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>“How do you feel?” Qing Shui asked as he hugged Luan Luan. He could still feel Luan Luan’s strength.</p>
 <p>“I’ve just broken through to Grade Four Martial Saint.” Luan Luan replied excitedly. Her strength had explosively increased by multiple folds. This was something that made Luan Luan still feel incredulous.</p>
 <p>“Our lass’s talent is good, able to absorb it well.” Qing Shui was also very happy as the Fate Pill had at least displayed its greatest effect, which was very critical for Luan Luan.</p>
 <p>Within the three generations of the Qing Clan, Qing Shui had yet to see a figure that was able to be a overlord. However, Luan Luan was different. Although she was in the fourth generation, she would be able to mature to a frightening level as long as he provided her with some assistance.</p>
 <p>“Father’s the most formidable. Everything was given by Father.” Luan Luan said happily as she hugged Qing Shui’s arm.</p>
 <p>There was no reason for Luan Luan not feel happy. She had parents that doted on her and her training was going well, therefore she was very happy. She worshipped the man she called father. He was omnipotent and she felt very blissful to be his daughter.</p>
 <p>“You’re my daughter, who would I give it to besides you.” Qing Shui said as they walked down the platform.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui handed her more than half of the Demonic Beast Advancing Pellets that he had refined and said, “Every pill has a percentage change of letting your demonic beast break through its current grade. Try to find a time to let your demonic beasts try them. As for the outcome, leave it to their luck.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, Father’s still the best.” Luan Luan replied as she received the pills. She had never been overly courteous with Qing Shui. Of course, it would be a problem if she wanted to be courteous with Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>Luan Luan left impatiently and Qing Shui wasn’t in a hurry for Luan Luan to take more medicinal pills. After all, she had just assimilated the Fate pill, and her body was currently in a saturated state, making it unsuitable for her to take medicinal pills for at least two months.</p>
 <p>Therefore, taking medicinal pills to amass strength would still require some time.</p>
 <p>The stronger the medicinal effect, the longer the resting period. The Fate pill could only be taken once in a lifetime. Medical pills at King grade, Emperor grade and so on also had their limitations. For example, only able to take once a week, once every two weeks or once every three days.</p>
 <p>Another difference was strength. If one was strong, the waiting duration in ingesting pills of the same grade would be shorter than if one was weak.</p>
 <p>Apart from Luan Luan and Yu Chang, Qing Shui had also given the others each a Beauty Pill. They had already reached maturity in their appearances, therefore they could take it. In fact, they could have taken it when they were slightly younger, as the Beauty Pill was used to preserve one’s youth, not preserve one’s appearance. The Appearance Preserving Pill would preserve one’s appearance at the time of ingestion. However, to make sure it was absolutely safe, Qing Shu only allowed them to take it after they had become adults.</p>
 <p>There was also the “Rejuvenation Pill” of legends. According to the medicinal pill’s intrinsic effects, it permitted one’s appearance to become younger. This medicinal pill was only mentioned in legends, with no evidence that it truly exists.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not leave, as he had to look after them for a while after they took the medicinal pill, especially those that were weaker in strength. For Yiye Jiange and the rest, there were no problems whatsoever.</p>
 <p>The Beauty Pill could increase one’s strength by 20%. Unfortunately, once they reached the level of Yiye Jiange the increase would be lesser, with the increase not exceeding ten countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Qing Bei and the Qing Clan members had their strengths increased quite a bit, with the increase being 20% of their total strength. This made them incomparably happy. However, their increase in strength was a far cry from ten countries worth of strength.</p>
 <p>The variety of medicinal pills Qing Shui had was not a lot, yet was not too few as well. Furthermore, they were powerful, where one had to take over a month’s worth of time to completely digest the medicinal effects. Regretfully, Di Chen had already left.</p>
 <p>After the matter with the Baima Aristocrat Clan had concluded, Di Chen had left. This caused Qing Shui to think of her from time to time, reminiscing the times spent together with her. It’s said that longing for a person was a kind of illness. The current Qing Shui also agreed with that. Furthermore, it wasn’t an easily treatable illness.</p>
 <p>Longing for someone was a kind of illness, and it was a type of suffering that penetrated the soul. This made him think about his mother. All these years, she had suffered the most. Qing Qing’s appearance and return had slowly eased quite a bit of pain from his mother’s heart.</p>
 <p>The greatness of his mother’s love had made her throw away everything. But not to forget, it was a kind of intense repression.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui had been brooding about his father’s death all along . That man had died, and had died like that...</p>
 <p>Within the Realm of the Violet Immortal!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qing Shui was refining pills. The formula for the Du Meridian Strengthening Pill was about to be revealed, therefore he at present he prioritised refining pills over training.</p>
 <p>Du Meridian Strengthening Pill!</p>
 <p>Among the eight extra vessels in the human body, the Ren and Du meridians were the most mysterious ones. These were the two most important large meridians within the human body. The main path the divine energy took within the human body was precisely along the Ren and Du meridians. Therefore, strengthening them would lead to unbelievable benefits.</p>
 <p>The Ren meridian was one of the large associated vessels among the eight extra vessels in the human body.The Du Meridian controls the strength and defense of one’s body. Training the Du Meridian to a certain level would increase the strength and defense of one’s body.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The crisp and clear ring in his spiritual sense made Qing Shui incomparably happy. However, he still continued to refine the Tiger Vitality pill that was mid refinement.</p>
 <p>Impatiently, he spread his spiritual sense through his body. The Du meridian was one of the large associated vessels among the eight extra vessels of the human body.The Du Meridian controls the spirit energy and spirit energy resistance of one’s body. Training the Du Meridian to a certain level would increase the spirit energy, spirit energy and magic resistance of one’s body.</p>
 <p>Immediately, he saw the formula of the Du Meridian Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>The formula of Du Meridian Strengthening Pill was as follows, Black Ember Flower, Magic Fruit, Five Elements Water Fruit, Five Elements Metal Fruit, Golden Bull Grass, 5000 Years Five Qi Sun Grass, Nine-Headed Lion Grass, Sky Penetrating Grass that is more than 5000 years old, Eight Immortals Grass, Sunflower that is more than 5000 years old, blood of a turtle that is more than 5000 years old, lingzhi that is more than 5000 years old, 5000 Years Starmoon flower, Icewater that is more than 5000 years old, Peak Martial Saint demonic beast’s core, Peak Martial Saint demonic beast’s tendons, Peak Martial Saint demonic beast’s blood, Rainbow Trout Fish, Vermillion Fruit and Peach of Immortality.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the formula, Qing Shui gawked, not knowing whether to be happy or to feel sad. Apart from exchanging the Strength-Enhancing Fruit and Five Elements Fruit with the Magic Fruit and Energy Fruit, there were no variations to the other herbs, with only the sequence of pairing the herbs that was different.</p>
 <p>The effect of the Du Meridian Strengthening Pill: Increase one’s base spirit energy and spirit energy control by 50 to100%, depending on the efficiency in one’s absorption. Consuming the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pill would result unexpected outcomes.</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not think that there would be such a description. However, this was something favorable. As long as he could refine the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill, he would be able to refine the Du Meridian Strengthening Pill.</p>
 <p>He still needed a million experience for the “Violet Qi Pill”!</p>
 <p>Qing Shui did not think about the “Violet Qi Pill”. As its experience was unlikely to differ, sometimes it needed a long time to accumulate enough experience.</p>
 <p>However, Qing Shui felt it was still best that he found the ingredients for the Ren Meridian Strengthening Pill and the Du Meridian Strengthening Pill as soon as possible. In addition, he would strive to train Roc Spreading Wings and the Heart of Roc.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Regardless of which skill breaking through to large success stage, his combat prowess would increase by several folds. However, Qing Shui knew that it would be an arduous journey. He now also knew that the Roc Form, Phoenix Form and Dragon Form would not be that easy to train in, so much so that even if he exhausted his whole life, he might only be able to see but not achieve success.</p>
 <p>“Father, look at my Earth Devouring Mouse.” Luan Luan said happily while looking at Qing Shui.</p>
 <p>This was the strongest Earth Devouring Mouse she had. Currently, it was as big as a calf. Its body looked akin to being made of metal, sleek and glossy. Its mace-like tail and sharp claws seemed to be made of steel. Its cold teeth were triangular in shape with some serration, causing people to feel a chill upon seeing it.</p>
 <p>。</p>
 <p>An Earth Devouring Mice of that size was incomparably terrifying, radiating a penetrating aura from this entire body.</p>
 <p>It had actually reached the strength of Grade Eight Martial Saint.</p>
 <p>Even someone with one star of strength would not be able to get an advantage against its true combat strength. This was the formidability of the Earth Devouring Mice. Furthermore, there were nine other mice it could coordinate with. With the ten of them, they could cover a large scope, let alone the leader had already grown much stronger.</p>
