  <p><strong>330 - Canghai Mingyue Hanging on a Thread, Dead End</strong></p>
  <p><span>“Haha, Brother Long Ying, Brother Qian Li, we haven’t met for 20 years. Please don’t take offence because I’ve brought people here for such an abrupt visit,” an elder person on the opposite left guffawed. </span></p>
  <p><span>“No, this is common. What’s more, we have already received the message yesterday morning. Can’t you see how welcomed you are by my Heavenly Palace disciples.”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Haha, alright, let’s stick to the old rules. 9 rounds of duels, 9 halls from Heavenly Palace, 9 levels from Sword Tower. Be it tower or hall, let’s see who has the most number of wins within 9 rounds, and each person can only participate once.” The old man on the left from Sword Tower chuckled. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Let’s do this according to Brother Ying Kong, but as the old rules stand, since Sword Tower came to Heavenly Palace, you will ascend the stage first to wait for 2 hours. Once the competition starts, it is hard to avoid death and injuries. So in accordance to the old rules, let’s try to prevent it, but be responsible for your lives and deaths.” </span></p>
  <p><span>“Alright, let’s cut the talk. Luo Fei, up the stage!”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Yes!” </span></p>
  <p><span>A polished young man held a 3 inch Greenedge Sword and walked towards the largest and highest battle stage in the square. Each step of his was like a dragon’s gambol and a tiger’s walk, unordinary indeed. </span></p>
  <p><span>“I am Luo Fei from Sword Tower. I have been bold enough as to stand on this stage and hope that the friends from Heavenly Palace will be kind enough to give me some pointers!” The young man called Luo Fei bowed and said confidently. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui saw that the young man was actually of the same level as Canghai Mingyue, his abilities at the pinnacle of Xiantian. He still had no clue what the sparring between Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower was about. </span></p>
  <p><span>There was silence, and a young man from Heavenly Palace went up, similarly holding a 3 inch Greenedge Sword. Qing Shui saw that his abilities were also at the pinnacle of Xiantian, but it was a pity that he had much fewer battling experience - he was stabbed and injured in less than 10 moves, thus defeated!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui noticed that Luo Fei’s swordsmanship was skillful, agile and very fast. Coupled with his lunges, he appeared especially buoyant. </span></p>
  <p><span>Followed him was another, who unfortunately suffered a defeat after 30 moves. Qing Shui realised that the young man from Sword Tower had deliberately dragged the time; he would have taken a shorter time to win if not for that. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Protecting the stage?!” Qing Shui knew the reason. Suddenly, he faintly recalled the conversation amongst the elderly just now. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui watched the hundred odds of people on the opposite side, and knew that majority of them was here to protect the stage.</span></p>
  <p><span>After the 3rd defeat, another went up. Qing Shui smiled. </span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue!</span></p>
  <p><span>Although she was also at the pinnacle of Xiantian, Qing Shui couldn’t help but be a little worried, despite knowing that Canghai Mingyue shouldn’t lose if there weren’t any unexpected things occurring. </span></p>
  <p><span>Cloudmist Steps!</span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue did not say a word but started off with Cloudmist Steps immediately, the long sword in her hand performing the Sword Dance that Qing Shui was familiar with. </span></p>
  <p><span>Sword Dance! </span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue was trained in Sword Dance, and being the beauty who could overthrow states and cities, her sword moves made everyone below heat up!</span></p>
  <p><span>“Too beautiful, my goddess!” </span></p>
  <p><span>“Why didn’t I know that Heavenly Palace had such a beautiful woman, looks like she must be from Misty Hall.”</span></p>
  <p><span>“If I had such a wife, just let me be with her for a day. No, half a day and I’ll be contented enough to die immediately.”</span></p>
  <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui watched Canghai Mingyue’s sword moves and clearly imprinted them into his mind, every move and every technique, as well as that wondrous stance of her as she drew each swing.</span></p>
  <p><span>She was graceful and beautiful without losing her sharpness!</span></p>
  <p><span>She then stabbed him as he stared blankly and loud roars of cheers erupted from the crowd. </span></p>
  <p><span>The Sword Tower young man called Luo Fei went down, and was replaced by another young fellow. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed, the young man was blushing so hard he did not dare to look at Canghai Mingyue. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui found it hard to believe there can be such a rare person; how can he fight when he did not even dare to look!</span></p>
  <p><span>His performance was followed by bursts of teasing and chiding from below! </span></p>
  <p><span>“Damned, that brother should come down and not embarrass Sword Tower, he’s shaming us men!” someone shouted out.</span></p>
  <p><span>The young man did not disappoint the crowd and admitted defeat even before the third move...</span></p>
  <p><span>After that, another two from Sword Tower went up. Both of them were at the pinnacle of Xiantian, making it difficult for them to attain victory against Canghai Mingyue. This battle itself already led Canghai Mingyue to fame in the Heavenly Palace. </span></p>
  <p><span>It wasn’t her martial skills, but her beauty and perfect charm that made her opponents surrender without fighting! </span></p>
  <p><span>Another from Sword Tower came up. He was a tall and burly young man who looked like a leopard and a black bear simultaneously, though his burly figure also gave off a vigorous and smooth feel. He wore a singlet made of hide in the middle of winter and his exposed arms and shoulders shone like black metal stones. With his curly beard, there seemed to be a fearful strength hidden within him at a glance. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span>“An opponent of Martial King Grade!” Qing Shui started to feel uneasy. </span></p>
  <p><span>The man’s hair was short and almost bald. The scars on his head were like tangled roots and branches and his black eyes were unfeeling. </span></p>
  <p><span>“This is bad!” Qing Shui became anxious, as if no one would be able to interfere once the man enters the stage.</span></p>
  <p><span>Many others were starting to worry for Canghai Mingyue, and rustling could be heard below. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Damned, why is it this “bloodthirsty wolf”. The other time, five of our Heavenly Disciples fell dead at his hands, and tens of others were paralysed. There were even three women, all dead! Every time he appears there would be either death or paralysis,” someone remarked anxiously. </span></p>
  <p><span>“He isn’t even considered human, but a cold blooded animal. His capabilities are amazing, especially his resistance and recuperability. They are insane.” </span></p>
  <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
  <p><span>The battle on stage had begun, there was no chance of a person at the pinnacle of Xiantian winning against a Martial King!</span></p>
  <p><span>One could surrender. It was normal and no one would blame her even if Canghai Mingyue surrendered now. Moreover, there were already people shouting it out from below. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Beauty, don’t let him hit you, he is too violent!”</span></p>
  <p><span>“Beauty, hurry up and surrender or it’ll be too late!” </span></p>
  <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui smiled bitterly, and took out a self-made willow leaf razor. He knew Canghai Mingyue would never admit defeat, it was a martial artist’s pride. Once she surrendered today, she would never have the chance to attempt Martial King Grade. </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui slowly approached the battle stage. The crowd was pushed away by Qing Shui’s invisible might! </span></p>
  <p><span>The wolf-like man attacked like a violent thunderstorm from the start. His hands were of silvery white claws that extended a foot long, shining like the winter light and giving off chills that made one’s skin contract even further in this wintery day. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Ding!” </span></p>
  <p><span>“Ding ding din…”</span></p>
  <p><span>At the start, Canghai Mingyue was like a tiny boat in the great ocean, her body dancing on the stage like a top. </span></p>
  <p><span>Every move was made as if she were on the brink of death. This time Canghai Mingyue did not use the Cloudmist Steps, but the “Dancing Moon Steps” that she practised from young, barely defending herself against the attacks from this young man. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Rip!”</span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue’s sleeves were torn apart, revealing a deep bloody cut as she quickly retreated.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, it was too late. The shadow of a winter light wedged the young man’s murderous intents and slid towards Canghai Mingyue’s throat. </span></p>
  <p><span>The hobby of the “Bloodthirsty Wolf” was to see blood spurting at the final moment of a woman’s life! The more beautiful the woman was, the more pleasure he felt. </span></p>
  <p><span>Many below the stage shut their eyes, unwilling to witness the grim scene! </span></p>
  <p><span>Canghai Mingyue, however, had a smile on her face at that instant. She was truly calm, slowly shutting those pair of eyes that were brilliant like the sun and moon. </span></p>
  <p><span>“Father, Mother, your daughter will be reuniting with you!” </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui squinted slightly and struck while Canghai Mingyue lifted her head to avoid the life-seizing claws. It was like a wintery light, a shimmering meteor. It was Qing Shui’s first time using a concealed weapon!</span></p>
  <p><span>“Shew!” </span></p>
  <p><span>“Poof!” </span></p>
  <p><span>The moment that Canghai Mingyue had been waiting for never came. She opened her eyes to see that the person who was supposed to take away her life had his throat pierced through, and a great force even knocked him back half a foot. This half a foot of distance managed to allow Canghai Mingyue to avoid that life-seizing claw!</span></p>
  <p><span>In this instance, all that happened on stage gave everyone a shock, excluding Qing Shui of course. </span></p>
  <p><span>What was astonishing was the meteor-like concealed weapon. At the same time, everyone was shocked that someone had dared to break the rules of the battle during such an occasion! </span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui slowly stepped up the battle ground, the thin Heavenly Palace clothing seeming offensively conspicuous this moment! </span></p>
  <p><span> “Ah, it’s Qing Shui, Qing Shui from Starmoon Hall..” </span></p>
  <p><span>“He is Qing Shui!” the woman that had been standing beside Qing Shui and treating him condescendingly was now in disbelief, muttering to herself!</span></p>
  <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
  <p><span>Suddenly, it was as if the stew within a pot boiled. The entire square was seething! </span></p>
  <p><span>“Qing Shui, why did you do that?” Canghai Mingyue knew Qing Shui had forced himself to this dead end for her sake. </span></p>
  <p><span>“I will adhere to the second law set by Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower!” Qing Shui slowly said as she looked up at the high level personnel from Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower. Although his voice had been low, it was clearly heard by almost everyone around. </span></p>
  <p><span>With that, he took Canghai Mingyue’s arm, tore out a piece of cloth from his clothing, and poured some Golden Sore Ointment on her before slowly bandaging it. </span></p>
  <p><span>All that was done extremely gently, but the domineering tone in his voice from before was still reeling in everyone’s ears. He was a man of mystery, saturating everyone with the desire to be close to him. </span></p>
  <p><span>Everyone was dazed. They knew that the anyone who broke the rules set by Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower would either be sentenced to death or have to fight to the death against 9 disciples from the opponent!</span></p>
  <p><span>1 against 9! </span></p>
  <p><span>And one can be sure that the 9 opponents would be at the level of Chief Disciple, the number one from each of the 9 levels!</span></p>
  <p><span>This rule was not to be broken by anyone. No one had dared to break it because the first law was death, and the second was practically death as well</span><span>—</span><span>battling to death against 9 opponents who were the strongest 9 of the similar generation. </span></p>
  <p><span>Sword Tower was, after all, a great sect of the same level as Heavenly Palace!</span></p>
  <p><span>Qing Shui only just knew of such a law, and only a person like Qing Shui would have been informed just now. Almost everyone else knew since they frequented battle grounds. This second law was only arranged between Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower. </span></p>
  <p><span>The first law being the death sentence was declared by all sects in Greencloud Country. Only those who are able to successfully challenge the union of all the sects in Greencloud Country would be allowed to not obey the law, since it would be meaningless for people of such abilities to be forced to obey. </span></p>
  <p><span>Fei Wuji stood below, his face ashen. </span></p>

 <p><span>Followed him was another, who unfortunately suffered a defeat after 30 moves. Qing Shui realised that the young man from Sword Tower had deliberately dragged the time; he would have taken a shorter time to win if not for that. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Protecting the stage?!” Qing Shui knew the reason. Suddenly, he faintly recalled the conversation amongst the elderly just now. </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui watched the hundred odds of people on the opposite side, and knew that majority of them was here to protect the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the 3rd defeat, another went up. Qing Shui smiled. </span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue!</span></p>
 <p><span>Although she was also at the pinnacle of Xiantian, Qing Shui couldn’t help but be a little worried, despite knowing that Canghai Mingyue shouldn’t lose if there weren’t any unexpected things occurring. </span></p>
 <p><span>Cloudmist Steps!</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue did not say a word but started off with Cloudmist Steps immediately, the long sword in her hand performing the Sword Dance that Qing Shui was familiar with. </span></p>
 <p><span>Sword Dance! </span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue was trained in Sword Dance, and being the beauty who could overthrow states and cities, her sword moves made everyone below heat up!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Too beautiful, my goddess!” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Why didn’t I know that Heavenly Palace had such a beautiful woman, looks like she must be from Misty Hall.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If I had such a wife, just let me be with her for a day. No, half a day and I’ll be contented enough to die immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui watched Canghai Mingyue’s sword moves and clearly imprinted them into his mind, every move and every technique, as well as that wondrous stance of her as she drew each swing.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was graceful and beautiful without losing her sharpness!</span></p>
 <p><span>She then stabbed him as he stared blankly and loud roars of cheers erupted from the crowd. </span></p>
 <p><span>The Sword Tower young man called Luo Fei went down, and was replaced by another young fellow. Qing Shui rubbed his nose and laughed, the young man was blushing so hard he did not dare to look at Canghai Mingyue. </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui found it hard to believe there can be such a rare person; how can he fight when he did not even dare to look!</span></p>
 <p><span>His performance was followed by bursts of teasing and chiding from below! </span></p>
 <p><span>“Damned, that brother should come down and not embarrass Sword Tower, he’s shaming us men!” someone shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span>The young man did not disappoint the crowd and admitted defeat even before the third move...</span></p>
 <p><span>After that, another two from Sword Tower went up. Both of them were at the pinnacle of Xiantian, making it difficult for them to attain victory against Canghai Mingyue. This battle itself already led Canghai Mingyue to fame in the Heavenly Palace. </span></p>
 <p><span>It wasn’t her martial skills, but her beauty and perfect charm that made her opponents surrender without fighting! </span></p>
 <p><span>Another from Sword Tower came up. He was a tall and burly young man who looked like a leopard and a black bear simultaneously, though his burly figure also gave off a vigorous and smooth feel. He wore a singlet made of hide in the middle of winter and his exposed arms and shoulders shone like black metal stones. With his curly beard, there seemed to be a fearful strength hidden within him at a glance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“An opponent of Martial King Grade!” Qing Shui started to feel uneasy. </span></p>
 <p><span>The man’s hair was short and almost bald. The scars on his head were like tangled roots and branches and his black eyes were unfeeling. </span></p>
 <p><span>“This is bad!” Qing Shui became anxious, as if no one would be able to interfere once the man enters the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>Many others were starting to worry for Canghai Mingyue, and rustling could be heard below. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Damned, why is it this “bloodthirsty wolf”. The other time, five of our Heavenly Disciples fell dead at his hands, and tens of others were paralysed. There were even three women, all dead! Every time he appears there would be either death or paralysis,” someone remarked anxiously. </span></p>
 <p><span>“He isn’t even considered human, but a cold blooded animal. His capabilities are amazing, especially his resistance and recuperability. They are insane.” </span></p>
 <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
 <p><span>The battle on stage had begun, there was no chance of a person at the pinnacle of Xiantian winning against a Martial King!</span></p>
 <p><span>One could surrender. It was normal and no one would blame her even if Canghai Mingyue surrendered now. Moreover, there were already people shouting it out from below. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Beauty, don’t let him hit you, he is too violent!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Beauty, hurry up and surrender or it’ll be too late!” </span></p>
 <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui smiled bitterly, and took out a self-made willow leaf razor. He knew Canghai Mingyue would never admit defeat, it was a martial artist’s pride. Once she surrendered today, she would never have the chance to attempt Martial King Grade. </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui slowly approached the battle stage. The crowd was pushed away by Qing Shui’s invisible might! </span></p>
 <p><span>The wolf-like man attacked like a violent thunderstorm from the start. His hands were of silvery white claws that extended a foot long, shining like the winter light and giving off chills that made one’s skin contract even further in this wintery day. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Ding!” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Ding ding din…”</span></p>
 <p><span>At the start, Canghai Mingyue was like a tiny boat in the great ocean, her body dancing on the stage like a top. </span></p>
 <p><span>Every move was made as if she were on the brink of death. This time Canghai Mingyue did not use the Cloudmist Steps, but the “Dancing Moon Steps” that she practised from young, barely defending herself against the attacks from this young man. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Rip!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue’s sleeves were torn apart, revealing a deep bloody cut as she quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, it was too late. The shadow of a winter light wedged the young man’s murderous intents and slid towards Canghai Mingyue’s throat. </span></p>
 <p><span>The hobby of the “Bloodthirsty Wolf” was to see blood spurting at the final moment of a woman’s life! The more beautiful the woman was, the more pleasure he felt. </span></p>
 <p><span>Many below the stage shut their eyes, unwilling to witness the grim scene! </span></p>
 <p><span>Canghai Mingyue, however, had a smile on her face at that instant. She was truly calm, slowly shutting those pair of eyes that were brilliant like the sun and moon. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Father, Mother, your daughter will be reuniting with you!” </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui squinted slightly and struck while Canghai Mingyue lifted her head to avoid the life-seizing claws. It was like a wintery light, a shimmering meteor. It was Qing Shui’s first time using a concealed weapon!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shew!” </span></p>
 <p><span>“Poof!” </span></p>
 <p><span>The moment that Canghai Mingyue had been waiting for never came. She opened her eyes to see that the person who was supposed to take away her life had his throat pierced through, and a great force even knocked him back half a foot. This half a foot of distance managed to allow Canghai Mingyue to avoid that life-seizing claw!</span></p>
 <p><span>In this instance, all that happened on stage gave everyone a shock, excluding Qing Shui of course. </span></p>
 <p><span>What was astonishing was the meteor-like concealed weapon. At the same time, everyone was shocked that someone had dared to break the rules of the battle during such an occasion! </span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui slowly stepped up the battle ground, the thin Heavenly Palace clothing seeming offensively conspicuous this moment! </span></p>
 <p><span> “Ah, it’s Qing Shui, Qing Shui from Starmoon Hall..” </span></p>
 <p><span>“He is Qing Shui!” the woman that had been standing beside Qing Shui and treating him condescendingly was now in disbelief, muttering to herself!</span></p>
 <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;、、、、、、、、、、、、、、</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, it was as if the stew within a pot boiled. The entire square was seething! </span></p>
 <p><span>“Qing Shui, why did you do that?” Canghai Mingyue knew Qing Shui had forced himself to this dead end for her sake. </span></p>
 <p><span>“I will adhere to the second law set by Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower!” Qing Shui slowly said as she looked up at the high level personnel from Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower. Although his voice had been low, it was clearly heard by almost everyone around. </span></p>
 <p><span>With that, he took Canghai Mingyue’s arm, tore out a piece of cloth from his clothing, and poured some Golden Sore Ointment on her before slowly bandaging it. </span></p>
 <p><span>All that was done extremely gently, but the domineering tone in his voice from before was still reeling in everyone’s ears. He was a man of mystery, saturating everyone with the desire to be close to him. </span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone was dazed. They knew that the anyone who broke the rules set by Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower would either be sentenced to death or have to fight to the death against 9 disciples from the opponent!</span></p>
 <p><span>1 against 9! </span></p>
 <p><span>And one can be sure that the 9 opponents would be at the level of Chief Disciple, the number one from each of the 9 levels!</span></p>
 <p><span>This rule was not to be broken by anyone. No one had dared to break it because the first law was death, and the second was practically death as well</span><span>—</span><span>battling to death against 9 opponents who were the strongest 9 of the similar generation. </span></p>
 <p><span>Sword Tower was, after all, a great sect of the same level as Heavenly Palace!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qing Shui only just knew of such a law, and only a person like Qing Shui would have been informed just now. Almost everyone else knew since they frequented battle grounds. This second law was only arranged between Heavenly Palace and Sword Tower. </span></p>
 <p><span>The first law being the death sentence was declared by all sects in Greencloud Country. Only those who are able to successfully challenge the union of all the sects in Greencloud Country would be allowed to not obey the law, since it would be meaningless for people of such abilities to be forced to obey. </span></p>
 <p><span>Fei Wuji stood below, his face ashen. </span></p>
