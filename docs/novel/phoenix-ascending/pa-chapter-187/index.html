 <p><span style>Chapter 187: Behind the Scene</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Chen frowned. He felt a sudden attraction to Jun Huang seeing her flushed face. He shook his head, forcing himself to forget about the inappropriate thoughts. He told himself that he was simply affected by the fact Jun Huang was into men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Lanying had been wondering why the study was so quiet. She walked out and immediately realized that Jun Huang had eaten the lotus seed soup instead of Qi Chen. She cursed at Jun Huang for spoiling her plan. She had to try to shirk off the suspicion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took a deep breath and walked up to them. She huffed seeing the aroused look on Jun Huang’s face. “What’s wrong with gentleman Feng?” she asked innocently. “Why is your face so red?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Chen had noticed Jun Huang’s condition. He turned to her with worried eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang knew she had been hit with aphrodisiac. She adjusted her breathing to hide her reaction, but she stumbled when she got to her feet. Qi Chen caught her before she fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From her misty eyes and feverish look, Qi Chen quickly figured out what was happening. He shot a glare at Wei Lanying, who put on an innocent look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what has happened, Your Highness,” said Wei Lanying. “The lotus soup was prepared by the kitchen for sister Nan. There was some left. I brought it to you because you haven’t had any. It has nothing to do with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This gentleman isn’t feeling well, Your Highness,” Jun Huang said as she pulled away from Qi Chen. She took a deep breath and cupped her hands. “Please excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Chen assumed that Jun Huang was preserving her purity for Nan Xun, so he didn’t stop her. He let her leave with a nod. Jun Huang threw Wei Lanying a glance before stumbling out of the room. Qi Chen walked away soon after, ignoring Wei Lanying’s insistent calls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every step Jun Huang took was a trial. Fortunately her home was not too far from Prince Chen Manor. Soon, she was able to return to her place. The page boy watching the door ran up to her. He was shocked when he felt her feverish skin. Jun Huang ordered him to keep quiet and prepare some cold water for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately stepped into the barrel of cold water when she got back to her room. A shudder ran down her spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier, Nan Xun had been waiting for Jun Huang at her place. When the sun started to set, he came to the conclusion that Jun Huang had been kept in Prince Chen Manor by Qi Chen, so he left for the manor to look for Jun Huang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t see Qi Chen. Instead, he ran into Wei Lanying. She mockingly told him that Jun Huang was under the influence of aphrodisiac. He demanded to know where Jun Huang was before rushing away, leaving Wei Lanying fuming.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Feng Baiyu is a man</span></i><span style>, she thought. </span><i><span style>How come the two princes have become so obsessed with him? It’s infuriating.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Xun hurried to Jun Huang’s place. The page boy assured him that Jun Huang had returned safely. Nan Xun let out a sigh of relief, but he didn’t stop his strides. He made his way to Jun Huang’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew how it felt to be hit by aphrodisiac. It wasn’t an experience he would like to have again. The thought that Jun Huang was undergoing such torture upset him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately Wei Lanying had not dared to put too big a dose in the soup. Jun Huang felt better after taking a cold bath. She stepped out of the wooden tub and put on some clean clothes. She lay on the bed on top of the blanket, her teeth clattering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Nan Xun opened the door, Jun Huang was curled on her bed, trembling. He could tell how long she had been immersed in the cold water. Her body was freezing and radiating cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a word, he took off his shoes and climbed onto the bed, pulling Jun Huang into his arms. Jun Huang was still feeling lightheaded. It took a moment for her to realize what was happening. The heat in her body acted up again. She pushed at Nan Xun, but he didn’t budge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let - let me go,” Jun Huang muttered weakly into his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Xun sighed. He could smell the scent of sandalwood from Jun Huang. He circled his arms around her and said in a resigned tone, “Don’t worry, I won’t do anything. I know how it feels. You’ll feel better this way. I’ll use my inner energy to help you adjust yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smoothed his hand over her back. Energy flowed from his warm hands into her body and slowly circulated through her system, which alleviated her discomfort. Her tightened jaw loosened somewhat and her eyes cleared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was getting late. Jun Huang was exhausted. She ended up falling asleep while she was in Nan Xun’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang’s breathing slowed to a steady pace. Nan Xun lowered his head to look at her. Her eyelashes trembled slightly in the air. She was sound asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Xun relaxed. Fortunately her condition wasn’t too serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t willing to let go, though. The chance to hold her didn’t come easily. He wasn’t going to let it slip. He gingerly pulled the blanket from under him and put it over his and Jun Huang’s body. He tightened his arms and dropped a featherlight kiss on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang murmured something unintelligible. Nan Xun stayed awake in the dark for a good while before he finally fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Day broke. Jun Huang’s eyes fluttered open. The first thing she saw was Nan Xun’s face. The rising sun streamed through the window and hit the side of his face. The entire room was covered in a warm glow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his sleep, Nan Xun looked softer and less stoic. It was rare to see the tender side under his steely demeanor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang tried to get up and realized that Nan Xun was still holding her. Nan Xun was always a light sleeper. Jun Huang’s slight movement was enough to wake him. He opened his eyes, leveling her with a deep and captivating gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang had shared a bed with Nan Xun before, but it was the first time she woke up in Nan Xun’s embrace. In Yun Town, the two of them had kept to their side of the bed, staying within their boundaries without ever nudging the line. She was not used to this intimacy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake?” Nan Xun said. His voice was still hoarse from his sleep. Jun Huang flushed a deep red and jerked away from him. She took a deep breath to steady herself and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Xun let out a rueful laugh seeing Jun Huang recovering her calm. He rubbed at his forehead and sat up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun had risen over the horizon. Jun Huang quickly got off the bed and put on a robe before pushing the door open. The backyard was bright and beautiful. It was a good day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Xun fixed his clothes and walked up to Jun Huang. He glanced at the servants sweeping the fallen leaves and hummed. “Do you still feel uncomfortable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang turned to him and shook her head with a smile. “I’m feeling better,” she said quietly. “Thank you for yesterday. If not for you, I’d have caught a cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going to let you suffer.” Nan Xun awkwardly touched his nose. Before he could say anything else, Little Girl came to announce that breakfast was ready. She also said that Qi Chen had sent a messenger early in the morning, asking Jun Huang to go to the manor as soon as she got the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t take long for Jun Huang to figure out what Qi Chen asked for her for. Their conversation about illegal salt vending had gone unfinished. Qi Chen must have failed to come up with a good solution after ruminating it over for a night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breakfast, Jun Huang went straight to Prince Chen Manor. As soon as she arrived, she saw the pregnant Nan Guyue. It had been a while. Nan Guyue’s belly was more and more pronounced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess.” Jun Huang was going to pretend she hadn’t seen Nan Guyue, but Nan Guyue had stopped in her track and turned to her. Jun Huang had no choice but to stop to greet her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Chen happened to be here for Nan Guyue as well. He relaxed when he saw Jun Huang and jogged up to her. “I didn’t know yesterday that brother Feng has been the victim of a foul trick. I assumed that brother Feng was feeling tired because of your trip. Rest assured, I will take responsibility for what happened in this manor and find the one behind this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang chuckled and looked up at Qi Chen. “Your Highness is too kind. This gentleman didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but this has happened in the manor. It’s not ideal to keep someone with ulterior motives around, is it? We should get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Chen had merely been trying to be diplomatic. Jun Huang’s words were a wake up call. He broke into cold sweat and nodded. “Brother Feng is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please excuse us, Guyue,” Qi Chen turned to Nan Guyue and said. “Let the servants keep you company. I have business to discuss with brother Feng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Guyue threw Jun Huang a look that Jun Huang did not understand. Jun Huang didn’t think too much of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nan Guyue nodded. “Of course. Your Highness should take care of your business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Chen was still concerned despite Nan Guyue’s ready agreement. He ordered two of his experienced servants to keep at Nan Guyue’s side before leading Jun Huang to the study. Nan Guyue kept her eyes on Jun Huang, but quickly looked away when Jun Huang turned to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jun Huang thought that perhaps she was overly sensitive. She followed Qi Chen into his study. Qi Chen had a servant bring them some tea. He poured Jun Huang a cup and said, “Yesterday I’ve spent some time thinking. I agree with what brother Feng said. My ambition is to gain the world, and it is going to be mine in the future. There’s no need for me to be in a rush. I’ll do as you suggested and let go of half of the salt vending business. What does brother Feng think?”</span></p>
