 <p><b>Chapter 165: Meeting A Love Rival Once Again (1)</b></p>
 <p>After a brief pause, Shen Jingbin broke the silence by speaking.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you have anything you want to tell me?”</p>
 <p>“I wanted to see if it would surprise you.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s lips twitched. “It wasn’t much of a surprise, but I definitely received quite a scare.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning smiled harmlessly. “Your classmate gave me quite a scare too. She’s a pretty upright girl.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cast a sidelong glance at him. “You can just say she’s foolish, I won’t mind.”</p>
 <p>“Cough…”&nbsp;<i>Can we not be so blunt</i>.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly remembered that the person in front of her didn’t come here on his own. “Since you’re here to give the lecture, where’s your older brother and that girl?”</p>
 <p>“My brother said he’ll bring Jian Cishu around, so I don’t need to worry about her.”</p>
 <p>“He’s such a nice brother.”</p>
 <p>The two of them continued speaking as they walked out.</p>
 <p>“Do you have anything on afterwards? If not, I’ll treat you to lunch.”</p>
 <p>Since someone was willing to treat her lunch, she naturally didn’t have any reason to reject. “Sure,” Came Shen Jingbin’s straightforward reply.</p>
 <p>Since she was having lunch with Zhao Chengning, she was a little embarrassed to call her dorm mates over to join them. The two of them randomly picked out a decent looking restaurant near the school and decided to eat there.</p>
 <p>It was nothing much to Shen Jingbin since it was her school to begin with. However, she felt that it was quite rare to see someone of Zhao Chengning’s status actually willing to dine at a small restaurant like this.</p>
 <p>It was lunchtime, so both the school canteen and nearby eateries were packed with people.</p>
 <p>When they entered the restaurant, the once bustling dining hall magically became silent for a few seconds.</p>
 <p>“Are there no waiters?” The two of them looked around. There weren’t any available seats in the dining hall, so they were thinking of looking for a waiter to check if there were any private rooms left.</p>
 <p>To turn a bigger profit, eateries near the school charged an additional fee for use of their private rooms. As such, the private rooms would often still be empty when the dining hall was full.</p>
 <p>The two of them looked around for a bit but weren’t able to find any waiters.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin carefully surveyed the place again before she finally spotted a lifeless looking waiter in a corner of the restaurant.</p>
 <p>“There’s one over there, gimme a minute,” Shen Jingbin said as she walked towards the waiter.</p>
 <p>Said waiter was still standing there in a daze after witnessing Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning’s breathtaking appearance. Now that the beautiful girl was walking towards him, his heart began thumping crazily.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he finally remembered that he was a still waiter. He hastily tidied up his appearance before he stuttered out, “How… how may I help you?”</p>
 <p>“Do you still have any empty private rooms available?”</p>
 <p>Ahh! Her voice sounded so nice! The waiter’s emotions suddenly started stirring.</p>
 <p>“There is, there is!” The waiter vigorously nodded his head like a little chick pecking at rice. Was she joking? He’d clear one out for her even if there weren’t any! “May I ask how many are dining?”</p>
 <p>“Two.”</p>
 <p>The waiter looked behind her and noticed a man who looked just as eye-catching as she did. “Alright, please call your friend along and follow me.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jingbin turned and gently waved at Zhao Chengning. Upon seeing her, Zhao Chengning strode over to her in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“Found one?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin pointed at the waiter leading the way. “Just follow him.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning nodded. As the two of them followed the waiter further in, the redwood door of the private room blocked out the red-hot gazes that were trained on them from the dining hall.</p>
 <p>“Oi oi oi, weren't those two people from just now looking a little too beautiful? They aren’t celebrities, are they?”</p>
 <p>“Are you an idiot? That girl just now is the famous Goddess Shen from the Management Department. I don’t recognise that guy though, haven’t seen him around in school before. But by right, there’s no reason for a handsome-looking guy like him to remain unknown till now.”</p>
 <p>“Bah, don’t you guys go on to the forums? Still, remember that successful entrepreneur our school’s said to have invited to give a lecture? That’s the guy. He’s got looks and has a good background. I’ve even heard that he’s the most eligible bachelor in B City…”</p>
 <p>“I remember! I remember! I’ve seen that post before, he’s called Zhao something-something,” One of them said as they hastily cut in.</p>
 <p>“Eh, so he’s a rich second generation huh? No wonder even a Goddess level figure’s having lunch with him. Society sure is pragmatic.”</p>
 <p>After saying so, the person who spoke realised there were several gazes filled with disdain staring at him. “What? What are you guys all looking at me for? Did I say something wrong?”</p>
 <p>One of the people sitting at the same table as he looked down on him, saying, “Which mountain did this angry youth crawl out from? You’re filled with so much righteous indignation, but do you know what Goddess Shen’s background is?”</p>
 <p>The guy whose words were previously filled with jealousy was a little dumbfounded. “What kind of background?”</p>
 <p>“Hoh, she’s from the wealthiest and most influential family in A City. She’d be able to do as she pleases even if she went to the capital, so the things you’ve just said are seriously laughable. Or perhaps, it’s just you who’s viewing all women through a tinted lens?”</p>
 <p>The man was told off so thoroughly that he had nothing to say. He just silently buried his head in his food and didn’t utter a single word more.</p>
 <p>Apart from discussions like these, students who recognised the pair had long since fished out their phones and started secretly taking pictures.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning didn’t allow for photography during his lecture, so no matter how mouth-wateringly enticing countless people found his face to be, they were unable to snap a picture of him to comfort themselves. Bumping into him again at the restaurant this time around was practically a blessing from the heavens!</p>
 <p>He’d even brought along a complementary Goddess, you’d have to be an idiot to not take pictures!</p>
