 <p><b>Chapter 163: The Director’s Rampage (1)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>The auditorium was suddenly filled with an awkward silence, yet several seconds later, hushed whispers broke out. Everyone present was unable to control themselves and started gossiping.</p>
 <p>In an instant, Shen Jingbin felt countless gazes land on her. Some were just interested in watching a good show, while others were mocking or unresigned.</p>
 <p>“You! Didn’t I remind all of you to ask&nbsp;<b>MEA-NING-FUL QUESTIONS?!</b>” Said the Director as he snatched back the microphone.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright, I can answer this question,” Unexpectedly, Zhao Chengning abruptly spoke, causing everyone to look towards him.</p>
 <p>A dazzling smile suddenly appeared on Zhao Chengning’s handsome face. “I like strong and independent women. As for this woman’s attractiveness, I can’t think of a single reason to dislike her.”</p>
 <p>Immediately after hearing him say that, astonished gasps could be heard from within the auditorium.</p>
 <p>After giving his answer, Zhao Chengning even discreetly winked at Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin caught her breath.&nbsp;<i>F*ck, what the hell is this guy doing?!</i></p>
 <p>“Hahaha. Alright, let’s move on to the next student. Remember, please ask&nbsp;<i>meaningful</i>&nbsp;questions!&nbsp;<b>Mea-ning-ful Ques-tions!</b>” The Director was flabbergasted by Zhao Chengning’s easy acceptance of it all. However, that just meant that he had a gentlemanly demeanour. It didn’t mean that he could just ignore his students’ shenanigans. Otherwise, if this got out, the reputation of his Management Department in A City would be ruined!</p>
 <p>With that in mind, the Director shot a vicious glare at Huajuan. She looked like she was a third year from class 1. She should be named Huajuan or something. Her name wasn’t important though since he’d now marked her! He’d slowly take his time and deal with her in the future.</p>
 <p>The controlled question and answer segment then continued on. After Huajuan sat back into her seat, she had a wide smile on her face as she popped up in front of Shen Jingbin. “Oh my, Jingjing did you hear what he said just now?! Zhao Chengning said he likes girls like you!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin pushed her face aside and said, “Get lost. Huajuan, you must really be suffering from something bad.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Jiangmeng looked over with a look of worry on her face. “Huajuan, you were way too impulsive just now. Take a look at the Director’s face, he’s definitely going to mark you for this.”</p>
 <p>Xiaohe landed the finishing blow. “It’s nothing as simple as just marking you. Take a look at his eyes, he’s practically out for blood!”</p>
 <p>It was only then that the folly of her earlier actions dawned upon Huajuan. She let out a howl of grief and cried, “Oh my god! What was I thinking just now?! Why did I ask a question like that??? Why didn’t any of you stop me?!”</p>
 <p>“We wanted to stop you, but you didn’t give us the chance!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. You stood up without saying a word to any of us, so we were all caught off guard!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin held her head in her palm. These three weren’t exactly being subtle. She could faintly feel the Director continuously glaring daggers in their direction.</p>
 <p>“Could you guys stop talking?”</p>
 <p>The three of them finally detected the all-encompassing resentment that was being exuded from the Director on the stage and silently closed their mouths.</p>
 <p><i>What should they do? They’ve offended the Director! Things are definitely going to be dire in the future. Waiting online, please reply ASAP!</i></p>
 <p>To avoid being glared at by the Director, the four of them pretended to be invisible for the second half of the lecture.</p>
 <p>The four of them managed to make it to the end of the lecture with great difficulty. After giving his closing speech, the Director turned off the microphone and shouted at Shen Jingbin and co with a booming voice, “Huajuan, Shen Jingbin, meet me in the office. I have some things I wish to discuss with the two of you.”</p>
 <p>“Director, I was wrong! Gajimayo (Don’t go)!!!” Huajuan cried out.</p>
 <p>“Director, I’m innocent!” Shen Jingbin blubbered.</p>
 <p>With the Director’s blatant abuse of power, the two of them had absolutely no chance of escaping. Huajuan wailed as she dragged Shen Jingbin by the arm to the Director’s office.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin didn’t have any superfluous emotions on her face. However, that didn’t mean she was calm on the inside. Rather, she was in a complete panic...</p>
 <p>Because she’d received an SMS from Zhao Chengning.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll pull you out.（＾－＾）”</p>
 <p><i>F*ck! Don’t do that!</i></p>
 <p>Unfortunately, nothing was going to change no matter how much she roared in her heart. In fact, she didn’t even have the time to reply to Zhao Chengning’s message!</p>
 <p>“Senior Shen, do your best.”</p>
 <p>“Senior, I’ll go with you. Just shout for me if the Director tries to hit you and I’ll come rushing in to save you!”</p>
 <p>As they made their way towards the auditorium’s exit, countless students from the Management Department couldn’t hold themselves back and tried to console her.</p>
 <p>Ah, their Goddess was far too pitiful. She’s being dragged down by her pig of a teammate.</p>
 <p><i>Don’t cry Goddess, we love you! Muack muack!</i></p>
 <p>“Hey, does that mean you guys can save me if the Director tries to hit me?” Huajuan said to the underclassman that spoke to Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>She remembered this junior. He should be in the school’s Taekwondo club and was rumoured to be pretty strong too. Stopping the Director shouldn’t be a problem at all!</p>
 <p>“Ah… no. I refuse. I’m Senior Shen’s exclusive bodyguard!” Came the junior’s unhesitating reply.</p>
 <p>Huajuan: ...</p>
 <p><i>Get lost! Get as far away from me as possible!</i></p>
