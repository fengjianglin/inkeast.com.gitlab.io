 <p><b>Chapter 339: Emerging Victorious (1)</b></p>
 <p>Crying Fish looked apprehensively at the wall of players before them. “Nine Ballads, what’re we going to do now? I’m afraid it’ll be hard for us to get past their defense line; it looks pretty solid.”</p>
 <p>Nine Ballads maintained her calm. “Fish, you’ll be in charge of breaking through their first line of defence. You should know which ones are easy to take down; target them.”</p>
 <p>She then turned her attention back to Neverending Journey and changed topics. “Guild Leader Journey, round up a squad and secure kills in this area whenever you see an opportunity.”</p>
 <p>“What about you?” Neverending Journey asked.</p>
 <p>“I’ll find a way to bring a party over to the Watchtower of Longevity.” Nine Ballads replied. “Tiny Little Loli, Inseparable Love, Return Of The Jedi, and North By Northwest, each of you is to bring along someone reliable and follow me.”</p>
 <p>The named individuals gave a solemn nod of their heads. Nine Ballads turned back to look at Crying Fish. This woman was the most prone to getting into trouble, so Nine Ballads had no choice but to remind her once again.</p>
 <p>“Fish, remember that you have an important part to play. If you don’t manage to attract their attention, there’s a high chance that they’ll realise we’re trying to launch an ambush on their backline. Once their backline receives backup, we won’t have any chance of winning this battle. We don’t know what the situation is with that ugly monster either, so we have to seize every opportunity we have.”</p>
 <p>Stirred by the gravity of her words, Crying Fish gave a solemn nod of her head. Following that, Nine Ballads left with her party.</p>
 <p>From the time she’d joined the Shinra Sect till now, Nine Ballads was able to subdue all of the players within the sect with her imposing presence. Not a single person objected to her plan.</p>
 <p>Crying Fish took a deep breath before she swept out her hand and howled in anger as she charged forward with the remaining players.</p>
 <p>Next Week Is Unlikely calmed himself. The Guild Leaders of Imperial City and Memelord exchanged a glance with one another and came to a tacit understanding. Both of them immediately encouraged their respective guild members to buck up!</p>
 <p>Under their leadership, players that weren’t a part of the three guilds joined in as well, and their spirits became just as indomitable as the rock-solid human wall they formed.</p>
 <p>Both sides clashed. Their roars shook the heavens and their blood boiled.</p>
 <p>During this time, Nine Ballads and her party were looking for a loophole in the enemy’s defence. There were numerous players from the Six Great Sects. Next Week Is Unlikely had also carefully placed people he trusted at every corner of Soundwave Temple, making sure to block off all the routes to the Tower of Longevity.</p>
 <p>Nine Ballads silently cursed.</p>
 <p>At times, having more people was an advantage, while at other times, it was a detriment. There’d always be something that was overlooked. Crying Fish noticed that Lonely Moon was the one guarding an area with a team of players.</p>
 <p>She immediately brought her party to where Lonely Moon was and called out to him when they were near enough.</p>
 <p>Crying Fish’s affectionate title of ‘Goddess’ wasn’t just because she was pretty. She had a unique voice and accent as well - the type that made it difficult for men to controls themselves when they heard it. Though her voice had changed, her accent was still the same. Lonely Moon had been secretly in love with her for a very long time, so he immediately froze when he heard her voice.</p>
 <p><i>An opportunity!</i></p>
 <p>Having waited a long time for this chance, Neverending Journey decisively charged forward, working together with Crying Fish to create an opening in their defence line.</p>
 <p>“Go!” Nine Ballads seized the opportunity and rushed forward.</p>
 <p>Next Week Is Unlikely rushed over as soon as he realised what was happening. But, Nine Ballads and company moved quickly, and by then, it was too late. They were all cloaked as well, so he failed to notice them.</p>
 <p>Without looking back, Nine Ballads and company dashed towards the Tower of Longevity.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen was guarding the Tower of Longevity when he was suddenly overcome by a strange sensation.</p>
 <p>Though his martial arts wasn’t up to snuff, he was still pretty sharp when it came to sensing danger and bloodlust thanks to Old Master Shen’s training.</p>
 <p>“Someone’s coming!” Shen Jingchen shouted as he raised his sword.</p>
 <p>The players guarding the Tower of Longevity immediately went on alert. Though the surrounding was silent and nothing seemed off, they didn’t relax their guard. All of them had faith in Dawn’s Twilight’s abilities.</p>
 <p>As expected, a figure in black appeared barely a minute later. The figure rushed forward without any concern for themselves before blowing themselves up. Shen Jingchen didn’t expect the opponent to unleash such a considerable attack as soon as they began their assault, so he immediately gave the command for everyone to scatter.</p>
 <p>The number one thing to do when an enemy was about to blow themselves up was to avoid standing together.</p>
 <p>“Now!”</p>
 <p>As soon as they scattered, several figures in black emerged and launched a combined attack against one of the players.</p>
 <p>The players, who were now scattered and left on their own, couldn’t hope to rival the combined strength of a group of black-clothed men and died within seconds. The black-clothed men didn’t waste any time either. They immediately turned their attention to their next target the second they finished off a player.</p>
 <p>All the people Shen Jingchen had brought had an acute battle sense. Though they were a little disoriented in the beginning, they quickly grouped together without the slightest bit of hesitation once the surprise wore off.</p>
 <p>“Hold them back! I’m going to put out the light!” Nine Ballads shouted before she ran towards the Tower of Longevity without looking back.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen rushed after the figure in black that barged into Watchtower of Longevity and shouted, “Hurry and call for backup! You guys guard this place; I’ll take care of the inside.”</p>
