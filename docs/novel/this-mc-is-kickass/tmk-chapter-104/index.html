 <p><span style><strong>Chapter 104:</strong> </span><b>A Disturbance On Weibo</b>&nbsp;<span style><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After looking through the stickied thread on popular strategies, Shen Jingbin was about to close up the forums and get some exercise when she suddenly received a call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced at the notification and found that it was from her roommate, Huajuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, what’s up Huajuan?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Jing Jing Jing Jing! Hurry up and take a look at Weibo Weibo Weibo Weibo!” Huajuan excitedly shouted over the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin had always known that Huajuan was a happy-go-lucky kind of girl, but this was her first time seeing her so excited. “Weibo? What about it?” Shen Jingbin asked, feeling puzzled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A celebrity microblogger on Weibo started an event to look for the most beautiful campus belle. We might have only been fooling around, but one day Xiaohe and I decided to post a picture of you and it went viral! Hahahahaha! So many people came to Xiaohe and I to ask about you, but rest assured, we didn’t reveal anything about you to them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin didn’t like taking selfies and neither did she enjoy going on Weibo, so up till now, she only paid attention to her roommates and a few other news related accounts. There were only a few who knew of her Weibo account.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To her, Weibo was just a place to browse for news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan’s announcement caused a bit of a headache for Shen Jingbin. “Why would you sell me out like that? I’m just a beauty who wants to keep a low profile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan’s tone immediately turned guilty, “Actually, we didn’t plan to post your pic at first. After all, we both know what you’re like. But did you know that Luo Xiaoqian actually entered as well? Most importantly, she turned out to be pretty popular as well and ended up garnering a lot of fans. After that, someone from our school ended up seeing it and commented beneath her picture that she wasn’t a match for you blablabla…cough cough…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she reached the good part, Huajuan was talking so animatedly that she accidentally swallowed her saliva. “You know that I like going on Weibo, and I happened to come across this. After I clicked on it, I found out that her fans were launching all sorts of malicious personal attacks against you. On top of that, someone mentioned what happened previously between you and her at school. Not only did they distort the truth, they even made you out to be some worthless scum. Do you think I’d be able to stand it after seeing this? So, after discussing it with Xiaohe, we decided to post up your pic to let them shoot themselves in the foot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Just how bored are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not the point, alright? What’s important is that Luo Xiaoqian was utterly destroyed by you. Even her fans have changed sides over the course of just one night. Hahahaha, I can’t take it…. We saw Luo Xiaoqian in school today and she was fuming mad.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So why do you want me to go on Weibo since you guys have managed to resolve everything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Shen Jingbin’s words as a reminder, Huajuan immediately talked about the matter at hand, “Oh, it’s like this: a few people from the game company happened to see your picture as well and wanted you to be their ambassador. But, they didn’t know how to contact you, so they looked for Xiaohe and I instead. We didn’t dare to give them your contact details, so we only told them your Weibo account. Do you want to take a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it, don’t bother about them. Just take it as me not knowing about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch, I knew things would turn out like this. Big sis, why don’t you make good use of that pretty face of yours?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Shen Jingbin succinctly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan choked a little and said in exasperation, “Alright, you win!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin hung up after saying a few more words to Huajuan. Shen Jingchen looked at her curiously and asked, “Who was that? Anything wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin put her phone away and said, “It’s nothing. Let’s go, we’ll take our take walking home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen only asked in passing and didn’t pay it any more mind since she didn’t answer. He shrugged and stood up as the two of them began to make their way back home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, faraway in B City, Zhao Chengning was opening his WeChat while sipping on his coffee. In Moments[1. Don’t forget! It’s WeChat’s social networking function </span><span style>Σｄ(ﾟ∀ﾟ)]</span><span style> , he happened to see a friend who was in senior high post up a picture of Shen Jingbin with the words: does anyone know this beauty? She was spotted on Weibo and the game company’s executives are thinking of asking her to be the game’s ambassadors, but they don’t have her contact info. .·´¯`(&gt;▂&lt;)´¯`·. Omnipotent Moments, please help me out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning almost spat out his coffee when he saw that. If memory served him right, this student should be working for the development team of &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slid his fingers across the screen and tapped on the student’s WeChat account.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning: Where’d you get a picture of that beauty in your moments from?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiangpeng: What the f*ck! It’s god Zhao! Are you interested in this beauty or do you know her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning: Answer my question first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiangpeng: I saw her on Weibo. God Zhao, you’ve got a connection, right? Help me find out about more about this beauty. I’ll treat you to a meal if you manage to get me her contact!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning: Hand over that Weibo link to me first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiangpeng: Alright, alright. Just wait a moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A minute later, Xiangpeng messaged the link to Zhao Chengning and he tapped on it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“#Searching for the most beautiful campus belle — Show off your campus belle and see who’s the most beautiful#”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eye-catching title was followed by a photo of Shen Jingbin that showcased her 360° of flawless beauty.</span></p>
