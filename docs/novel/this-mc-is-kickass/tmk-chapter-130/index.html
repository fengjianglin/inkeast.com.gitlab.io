 <p><b>Chapter 130: Herb Gathering At Cloud Dream Swamp (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>All Life Skills required specific tools to perform them. For example, concocting medicine required a medicinal cauldron. However till now, she had yet to possess even the lowest grade medicinal cauldron. As such, her top priority was to get a medicinal cauldron, some medicinal elixir recipes, and herbs for concocting. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Medicinal Cauldrons could be found in Life Skill shops. After arriving at Jiang City’s Life Skill shop, Shen Jingbin asked the shop owner about it and also purchased recipes for some low grade medicinal elixirs. She then went to the teleportation point and transported herself to Thunder Marsh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within Thunder Marsh was a swamp forest called Cloud Dream Swamp, which was covered by a thick layer of mist all year round. On top of that, there were numerous venomous mosquitoes and snakes. In spite of that, this map had more medicinal herbs compared to other maps. For low grade medicinal herbs; there was dream grass and fuchsias, while high grade medicinal herbs consisted of rebirth fruits and reincarnation grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, finding high grade medicinal herbs would be slightly more difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truth be told, Shen Jingbin really hated damp places. In spite of that, for the sake of gathering medicinal herbs, she had no choice but to put up with her feelings of disgust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cloud Dream Swamp was like a primordial forest where opportunity and danger came hand in hand. To prevent poisonous snakes and wild beasts from jumping out of hiding and attacking her, Shen Jingbin summoned Mascot to her side for protection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from revealing a monster’s Level, the Appraisal skill that players normally used could also identify different kinds of medicinal herbs. Shen Jingbin led Mascot and wandered about the mist filled swamp forest as she appraised the various fauna by her feet, immediately squatting down and harvesting any herbs that were identified. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After casting Appraisal, multiple dings rang out from the system notification by her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on discovering Starry Grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on obtaining Starry Grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on discovering Heart Decaying Mushroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on obtaining Heart Decaying Mushroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on discovering Thousand Illusory Indigo Plant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on obtaining Thousand Illusory Indigo Plant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, Shen Jingbin’s backpack was practically bursting at the seams and she’d unknowingly walked into the depths of Cloud Dream Swamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a high chance of obtaining precious medicinal herbs in the depth of Cloud Dream Swamp, but it was proportionately dangerous as well. After sorting out her backpack, Shen Jingbin realized that there wasn’t a single slot of space left in it, so she decided to return by retracing her steps. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was utterly dumbstruck when she turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of place was a primordial forest? It was the kind of place that looked the same no matter where you turned!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin felt faint. </span><i><span style>My god, which way did I come in from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced at Mascot who was by her side. Cats were supposed to have a very sharp sense of smell, so why not try letting Mascot lead the way? </span></p>
 <p><span style>But…were cats the ones with a sharp sense of smell, or was it dogs? Or, were both of them pretty good at it?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Forget it, she wasn’t going to bother about it anymore. Either way, either one was a better alternative to herself.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin crouched down and rubbed Mascot’s head. “Quickly, can you figure out which way we came from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mascot blinked at her cutely.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Maybe it doesn’t understand? Alright, she’ll try a different method of speaking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Look around and bring me to the place with the most people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were probably lots of people near Cloud Dream Swamp’s teleportation point. Going by that logic, going towards the place with the most people should allow her to leave this sunless area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost as if it’d understand what she said this time around, Mascot gave a soft cry before it swished its tail and started moving towards a certain direction. Shen Jingbin followed behind it, splitting her attention between assessing the area and being on the lookout for anything of note.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After walking along with Mascot for a bit, Shen Jingbin realised something felt a little off.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did she feel that the light was becoming increasingly dimmer the further she walked? She wasn’t going deeper in, was she?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin stopped in her tracks. After taking a few more steps, Mascot looked back at her when it realised its Master wasn’t following it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mascot, are you sure you know where you’re going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Forget it, I wouldn’t understand you even if you did reply.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Shen Jingbin thought of her relatively useless map and hurriedly pulled it out of her backpack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sure enough, she was going further in!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dream Cloud Swamp was vast. Looking at the map, she found herself at the furthest edge of the map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin suddenly heard someone crying out for help when she was busy examining the map, so storing her map away, she listened intently for the voice. It was coming from the direction she was facing, and she could even hear the sound of blades clashing against one another if she strained her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mascot, go over and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She figured she might as well go over and take a look since she couldn’t find a way out. Who knows, this person might even be able to lead her out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar!” With a mighty roar from Mascot, both Master and pet sped towards the source of the sound. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A short distance away, Shen Jingbin spotted numerous figures leaping about from the gap between the trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It turned out there was actually a large group of players here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mascot, shrink yourself down a bit,” As she was unclear of the situation, Shen Jingbin didn’t want to just rush in. After Mascot shrunk down, she grabbed it and carefully inched forward, before she then hid behind a tree trunk that was wide enough to fit two people and stretched to the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of her were nearly thirty people and a towering dark red figure that was trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On closer inspection, the towering figure turned out to be a monster with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. This monster had basically the same structure as a mermaid, but it’s actual appearance was completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this monster had the upper body of a human, it looked extremely ferocious and had blue veins protruding out of its body. Its lower body didn’t have the beautiful fish tail of a mermaid either. Instead, it had a burly tail akin to that of an alligator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, it was using its tail to prop itself up and brandishing the spiked mace in its hand, throwing players that got close to it to the ground. It wasn’t satisfied with just flooring them either. It even lashed out with its burly tail and viciously pounded the players, causing its victims to let out blood-curdling shrieks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of players who could still stand continuously shrunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help! Help!” Suddenly, a player wearing dark coloured clothes; dark enough to almost blend in with the surrounding trees, started running towards Shen Jingbin whilst shouting for help at the top of their lungs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the same voice she’d heard just moments before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marco Polo Bun?” The distance, coupled with the fact that this player practically blended in with the surrounding trees, meant that Shen Jingbin could only hear his voice but found herself unable to spot him. Now that she’d caught sight of him, she immediately recognized that this was the very same Marco Polo Bun that she’d met in Hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing someone call out his name, Marco Polo Bun skidded to a halt and looked towards Shen Jingbin. “Who called me?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking a closer look at her, Marco Polo Bun immediately cried out in astonishment, “What the f*ck, why’re you here?!”</span></p>
