 <p><b>Chapter 135: Capitalism Is The Root Of All Evil (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast estimated the distance between Shen Jingbin and the Universal Envoy before walking to her side. “Do you know that guy?” He enquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was referring to Marco Polo Bun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason for his enquiry was because he noticed her eyes sparkling whenever she looked at that person. It was an expression that he’d never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Shen Jingbin nodded in affirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the sight, Quiet And Steadfast evaluated Marco Polo Bun once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marco Polo Bun, who was in the midst of playing a game of tag with the Universal Envoy, felt a sudden chill run down his spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how formidable the Universal Envoy might be, it was still unable to handle the onslaught of numerous top-tier players. Not much time had passed since it started pursuing Marco Polo Bun before its Health bar was almost empty. However, Marco Polo Bun was running out of steam as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the Universal Envoy knocked him out now, it wouldn’t be able to carry him back to its nest. Since that’s the case, screw it! He might as well fight!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this thought in mind, Marco Polo Bun steeled himself against running and turned around, preparing to use every skill he had against the Universal Envoy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the number one Dragonkin in Jade Sea Pavilion, Asuka, happened to unleashed a powerful skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only was Asuka Jade Sea Pavilion's number one Dragonkin, she was also the top Dragonkin in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; and her DPS was off the charts. The Universal Envoy’s Health was instantly reduced to just a few points after Asuka unleashed her skill, followed by Marco Polo Bun’s own skill immediately after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a resounding roar, the Universal Envoy collapsed, never to rise again. At the same time, a scarlet red announcement appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[System Announcement] Congratulations to Player Marco Polo Bun for successfully defeating the Universal Envoy and ridding the world of an evil! He’s the honour of the hour!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marco Polo Bun almost choked on his own spit. Never in his wildest dreams did he think that he would actually be the one to deal the final blow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t he just too lucky?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no longer any threat now that the Universal Envoy was dead. “Sunhill, Lotus, and Luoluo, search for our comrades and bring back those who have been taken away. Nymphs, see if you can rouse those around us. Polo Bun, harvest the Seven Cycle Reincarnation Fruit before looting the corpse,” Morally Grey ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The players who were chosen began carrying out the tasks that they were assigned to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marco Polo Bun jogged over to where he’d first discovered the Seven Cycle Reincarnation Fruit and began harvesting it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gathering it was slow due to its rarity, so it took him a whole five minutes before he was able to dig it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on obtaining the Seven Cycle Reincarnation Fruit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pleasing sound of the system announcement rang out. With a face full of smiles, Marco Polo Bun gingerly placed the gathered fruit into his backpack before running over to the Universal Envoy and reaching out to loot the corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained 50 silver.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a Graceful Jade Whisk x1. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a Lustrous Clear Cloud Robe x1. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained Floating Light Silk x5”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The items dropped from the Universal Envoy were numerous. A casual glance from Marco Polo Bun informed him that these items weren’t bad at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the matter, what dropped?” Morally Grey walked up to him and enquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marco Polo Bun reported the items that he’d received. With slightly furrowed brows, Morally Grey pondered for a while before saying, “Pass me the whisk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marco Polo Bun gave the Graceful Jade Whisk to him without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morally Grey took the whisk that the Universal Envoy dropped in hand and walked up to Shen Jingbin. “I noticed that your equipment seemed to be lacking, so please take this as a token of our appreciation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need,” Shen Jingbin declined. As the saying goes: </span><i><span style>He who does not work shall not eat.</span></i><span style> She wasn’t shameless enough to accept something she didn’t deserve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please accept this, this wouldn’t have been so easy if it weren’t for you calling the players of Jade Sea Pavilion over to help,” Morally Grey said before pushing the whisk into her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was about to return the whisk to him when Quiet And Steadfast said to her, “You should just accept it since he’s given it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked at him and the silent Morally Grey before quietly accepting the Graceful Jade Whisk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Shen Jingbin felt that she hadn’t contributed in any way, it was anything but that in Morally Grey’s eyes. He wasn’t someone who liked owing others a favor and immediately sought to repay his debts as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Daoists in his guild were few and the elite players mostly had weapons that they’d painstakingly crafted, while an ordinary whisk would suffice for the remaining few. As such, the whisk wasn’t very important in the eyes of his guild despite its good attributes. Instead, it would serve better as repayment for the debt that he owed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast had clearly noticed this, which was why he persuaded Shen Jingbin to accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morally Grey chuckled as he saw Shen Jingbin accept the whisk. He turned to Quiet And Steadfast and said, “Thanks for today’s help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast gave him a polite smile in return. However, due to the mask he was wearing, only his ink black eyes conveyed his intent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re welcome.”</span></p>
