 <p><b>Chapter 133: Support From Jade Sea Pavilion (1)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re Quiet And Steadfast’s wife?” Morally Grey said as the two of them sized each other up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that Jade Sea Pavilion’s Guild Leader had married an ugly girl. He’d unintentionally seen her together with Quiet And Steadfast during the previous free for all involving a few guilds. As a result, he still vaguely remembered her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?” Shen Jingbin wrinkled her brows and asked. The other party knew who she was, but she didn’t recognize him; that didn’t sit right with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Memelord’s Guild Leader. I saw you in Redwood Forest last time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morally Grey’s words jogged her memory, prompting a vague image of him to surface within her mind. She even remembered that he and another Guild Leader had sent out realm messages at the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re by yourself?” Morally Grey cast several more glances around and asked. “Isn’t Quiet And Steadfast here with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s offline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This map is quite dangerous. Why are you here alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin could sense that he was trying to feel her out. “I came here to gather medicinal herbs. I’m learning how to refine medicine, so I wanted to gather a few medicinal herbs to train my Life Skills,” She replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morally Grey nodded, but whether he believed her or not was another matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked towards Marco Polo Bun once again and asked, “Where are the rest of the guild members? Where’s the Universal Envoy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marco Polo Bun pointed behind him and said, “They’re over there! The Universal Envoy is carrying people back to its nest.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Morally Grey brows knitted, “How long have they been gone for and when will it be back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It just left and it should be back soon,” replied Shen Jingbin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he heard that, Morally Grey immediately started issuing orders to the players he’d brought along. “Group one, move to the left and lie low. Group two, to the right. Group 3 will wait here. Move out. We have to hide before the Universal Envoy returns. Be on the lookout for my signal once you’ve hidden yourselves. We’ll move once I give the signal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The tens of people gathered in front of him replied as one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, countless silhouettes flashed past her, and in the blink of an eye, they disappeared right before her very eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After making the necessary arrangements, Morally Grey shifted his attention back to Shen Jingbin and Marco Polo Bun. “The two of you will hide here. Escape immediately if the situation takes a turn for the worse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” The two of them replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After everyone had hidden, the Universal Envoy came swaying over with its robust body and swaggered before everyone. It then chose a player and carried it back to its nest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a snap resounded from where Morally Grey was hiding behind a tree. No sooner after that, tens of silhouettes leaped out from all directions, unleashing multitudes of colourful skills at the Universal Envoy as they slammed against its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morally Grey had guessed that the Universal Envoy was likely a close combat monster, so he’d warned his guild members to keep their distance from the monster in advance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reality proved that his guess was right on the money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Universal Envoy noticed the uninvited guests that surrounded it the instant he heard the snapping of fingers. Not missing a beat, it flung the player on its shoulder away and grabbed its mace. With a loud screech, the monster proceeded to pounce on one of the players. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Following the plan that was made earlier, they immediately halted their attacks on the Universal Envoy and turned tail to run. While those beside it also dispersed in all directions at the same time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t know whether the Universal Envoy would pursue a player till they died, or whether it would change targets halfway through. As a precautionary measure, they decided that once the Universal Envoy targeted a player, the rest of the players around them would immediately flee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Universal Envoy seemed oblivious to the numerous players fleeing in all directions, wholly focused on pursuing its initial target. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Circles, Kite the monster. The rest of you, go all out on it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The players replied as one once again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster had its eye on a player called Circles. Circles buffed himself with an agility boost and was running all about the dense forest. The rest of the players ensured they kept their distance from Circles and went all out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar!” As its HP gradually decreased, the Universal Envoy suddenly raised its head and let loose a roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from Shen Jingbin and Marco Polo Bun who’d experienced this before and covered their ears the moment they saw its throat ripple, the rest of them felt a sharp stab of pain in their ears. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The soundwave caused Circles to slow down as well. It was only for a split second, but it was more than enough for the Universal Envoy to catch up to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Universal Envoy raised its mace high in the air and ruthlessly smashed it down on his head. Circles immediately collapsed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This monster could actually unleash a soundwave attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fear arose in everyone’s hearts.</span></p>
