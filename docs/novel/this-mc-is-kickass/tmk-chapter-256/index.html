 <p><b>Chapter 256: I Do (2)</b></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning quickly came back to himself and said to Xia Qihui, “She’s the one I wanted to introduce to you at the get together the other day, but unfortunately, you didn’t come. Let’s talk again next when we get the chance. Help me look out for news about this on the internet; I’m hanging up.”</p>
 <p>With that, he hung up without waiting for the other party’s reply. He then opened the car door and got into the driver’s seat. He’d already rested for a bit in the afternoon, so he obviously wouldn’t get her to drive again.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin spoke up the moment he got into the car, “Shen Jingchen said he’d be coming over now; let’s wait for him.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning gave a grunt of acknowledgment as he nodded.</p>
 <p>They fell silent at the same time.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning was the first to speak after a few moments of silence. “Do you have an answer to the question that I asked you during the get-together?” He asked as he turned to gaze fixedly at her. His ardent gaze was so hot that it felt like it was scalding her. “I don’t have any experience with women, and oftentimes, I don’t know how to express my feelings towards you. I worry about you rejecting me if I’m too blunt, but at the same time, I worry that my feelings won’t be able to get across if I’m too indirect… Truth be told, my heart’s been in turmoil all this time because I didn’t know how you felt about me. Agonizing over things like this is far too much for me to take, so, I hope that you can give me a straight answer regardless of what your reply is.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin stared at him in stunned silence for several seconds before her entire body started to glow like a lit candle. She just quietly stared at the man in front of her with a smile on her face and took his hand into hers.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be your girlfriend.”</p>
 <p>Immediately after, Shen Jingbin felt a powerful force grab her hand and draw her into a warm embrace. A familiar fragrance caressed the tip of her nose once again.</p>
 <p>Feeling the arms that were wrapping her in an embrace gradually close around her, she stretched out her hands to entwine her arms around his slender body.</p>
 <p>Their bodies met in the space between the driver and passenger seat as they embraced one another.</p>
 <p>“I’m so happy,” Zhao Chengning said in a whisper as he buried his face in her neck, his magnetic voice turning especially seductive. Shen Jingbin could feel her heart beating wildly in her chest as she felt the warmth of his breath caress her collarbone.</p>
 <p>“Mm,” Shen Jingbin replied in a small voice.</p>
 <p>“Sorry about that, but can you guys open the door? It’s a little chilly out here.”</p>
 <p>The tender feelings between the two lovebirds lasted for less than a minute before the one who specialised in killing the mood appeared. Shen Jingbin suddenly saw Shen Jingchen’s face plastered on the window as he began knocking at it.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning immediately separated themselves from one another. Zhao Chengning glanced at her and lightly coughed before he released the car’s door locks. The moment that happened, Shen Jingchen shot into the car with a ‘whoosh’.</p>
 <p>“It’s freezing outside; I almost turned into a popsicle! Professor Feng kept tugging at me to chat me up. If it weren’t for you, Little Jing Jing, I probably would’ve been a corpse on the street by tomorrow… Eh, why are the two of you acting so strangely?” Shen Jingchen began incessantly chattering the instant he entered the car. He kept going on and on till he finally realised the two of them weren’t paying any attention to him.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing; you’re overthinking things,” Shen Jingbin replied.</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Shen Jingchen asked as he leaned forward and looked between them, his face a mask of suspicion.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning spoke up at just the right time, “Sit down. We’re going back now.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen grunted in acknowledgement and returned to his seat. After that, Zhao Chengning started up the car and sent them home.</p>
 <p>When they reached the apartment, Zhao Chengning’s hand quickly shot out and grabbed Shen Jingbin’s own hand that was just about to open the car door. “Tomorrow, let’s have dinner together,” he said. He then glanced at Shen Jingchen and continued, “Just the two of us; without him.”</p>
 <p>He then winked at her.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin smiled, causing her eyes to arch upwards in happiness. “Alright, be careful on the way back.”</p>
 <p>After that, almost as if she’d thought of something else, she leaned forward and landed a gentle kiss on his face. “Good night.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning was momentarily stunned before he let go of her hand and smiled back at her. “Good night.”</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck?! What the hell were the two of you doing inside just now?!! I saw everything!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin watched Zhao Chengning’s car gradually disappear from sight before she turned around and got ready to go up to the apartment.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen finally broke out of his stupor after having caught a glimpse of something he shouldn’t have seen and pointed at his sister in horror.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin rolled her eyes at him and said, “Why are you asking me about it when you saw it for yourself? We don’t know whether Mom or Dad’s back yet, so let’s go up first to find out.”</p>
 <p>With that, she took the lead and began making her way upstairs.</p>
 <p>“Hey hey hey, don’t you have anything to say to me after something so major happened? Shen Jingbin, I’m your brother… Oi, wait for me, you little bitch! Hey, are you listening to me?!”</p>
 <p>“Are you that much of a chatterbox? Why are you so talkative?”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m just concerned about you. Weren’t things between the two of you still very normal before this? Why are things so… uhm… so… you know what I mean!”</p>
 <p>“What’s so strange about it? Things progressed between the two of us and we just took our relationship to the next stage. Are you coming in or not? You can climb the stairs yourself if you’re not coming in.”</p>
 <p>“F*ck, so the two of you were making a move on one another in secret! I’m telling Mom and Dad about you!”</p>
 <p>Her gaze drifted over to him and she looked like she didn’t have a care in the world. “Whatever floats your boat. Either way, it doesn’t bother me.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p><i>F*ck, why did he feel so stifled?!</i></p>
