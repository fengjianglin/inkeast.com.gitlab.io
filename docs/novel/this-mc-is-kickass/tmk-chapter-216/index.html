 <p><b>Chapter 216: Numerous Hidden Love Rivals (2)</b></p>
 <p>Likely alerted by the noise outside, a figure emerged from behind a pearl curtain. A tinkling sound could be heard as the figure brushed against the curtains before a roughly fifty-year-old man appeared before the two of them.</p>
 <p>“So, it’s Ah Ning,” The old man’s eyes twinkled as he looked at Zhao Chengning.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Xie.”</p>
 <p>The old man walked over. “Why’re you here today?”</p>
 <p>“I brought a friend over to take a look at your shop. Grandpa Xie, this is my friend, Shen Jingbin. LIttle Jing, this is Grandpa Xie, who’s also the owner of Jade Treasure Pavilion.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin respectfully greeted him, “Grandpa Xie.”</p>
 <p>The elderly man looked at her curiously and asked, “Are you Ole Shen’s granddaughter?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, does Grandpa Xie know my Grandfather?”</p>
 <p>“That old coot,” The old man said with a smile. “Of course I know him. Back then the three of us were inseparable.”</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Xie, Grandpa Shen, and my own Grandfather were all very good friends back in the day,” Zhao Chengning added.</p>
 <p>“So, what’re you here to buy today?” Grandpa Xie looked like he was in an excellent mood, and wore a smile on his face the entire time he was looking at Shen Jingbin. “My shop doesn’t offer anything else apart from a few rocks. If you’re okay with that, then you can just pick out a few of them, and I’ll give them to you. Think of it as a gift for becoming acquaintances.”</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Xie, there’s no need for you to be so courteous,” Shen Jingbin hurriedly replied.</p>
 <p>“I’m not being courteous. As someone of the older generation, I’m just giving you, someone from the younger generation, a small present to express my feelings towards the many years I haven’t seen Ole Shen for.”</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Xie is welcome to visit us any time.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, alright, then I won’t have any reservations about coming.”</p>
 <p>“Please don’t.”</p>
 <p>“You two pick out something first, I’ll be further inside for a little bit,” Grandpa Xie said with a wave of his hand before he disappeared into another room.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave Zhao Chengning a nudge and asked, “Why’d Grandpa Xie go inside? Doesn’t he need to watch the shop?”</p>
 <p>“No one would be foolish enough to come in here and cause trouble, so he doesn’t need to watch the shop.”</p>
 <p>“That sounds really cool.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning smiled and patted her on the shoulder. “Have a look and see if there’s anything you like.”</p>
 <p>Compared to things like gold, silver, and other precious stones, Shen Jingbin liked jade items even more. To her, while gold and silver were breathtakingly beautiful, they were dead and lifeless; possessing no spirit of their own. Jade, on the other hand, was different. Its colour could refresh one’s mind, and the various designs on them allowed others to experience a sense of vigor and vitality.</p>
 <p>She’d seen a fair number of jade pieces in the past, but the ones from Jade Treasure Pavilion were top quality. Shen Jingbin was dazzled by what she saw when she walked around the shop. In the end, she was struggling to decide between a jade Buddha statue and a jade gourd.</p>
 <p>These two jade pieces were of excellent quality and were at least A grade and above.</p>
 <p>When she was about to consult Zhao Chengning on which piece would make a better present for her Grandfather, she heard a voices coming from the entrance.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning had said that there were usually very few people around here, so this was definitely a customer.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the voices continued to draw nearer. As Shen Jingbin listened on, she realised that one of the voices sounded familiar.</p>
 <p>“Mr Xie, I heard you’ve got a new batch of products in, I’ve come to… Second Young Master?! What a coincidence!”</p>
 <p>The newcomer really was someone she knew. It was the Lady Boss of Blooming Flower Pavilion, Chenyi.</p>
 <p>“It looks like Miss Shen’s here as well. It truly is a coincidence,” Chenyi had spotted Zhao Chengning the moment she’d stepped into the shop. But, before she had the chance to celebrate, she’d noticed Shen Jingbin standing on the other side of the shop out of the corner of her eye. Whatever happiness she’d felt at seeing Zhao Chengning was immediately dispelled.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked towards her and nodded. “Greetings, Miss Chen.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning returned her greeting with a simple glance before he strode over to Shen Jingbin’s side and whispered a question into her ear, “Are you trying to decide on which one to get?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin raised her head and looked him in the eye. “Mm, I think they’re both pretty good.”</p>
 <p>Chenyi felt her heart clench when she saw the level of intimacy between them. Just as she was about to go up and separate them, one of her companions called out from behind her.</p>
 <p>“Boss, I’ve parked the car,” The delicate and pretty Zhang Beiyu came jogging in with the car keys. She froze when she saw Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin. “Mr Zhao?” After saying this, her face then proceeded to flush a deep red.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked at the two of them standing by the door and let out a chuckle in her heart.</p>
 <p><i>Were these two her hidden love rivals?</i></p>
 <p><i>What a coincidence.</i></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning clearly still had some recollection of Zhang Beiyu. If he was disinterested in Chenyi, then Zhang Beiyu was someone he despised.</p>
 <p><i>Although I’ve mercilessly rejected you, the sin of trying to seduce me in front of my wife isn’t one that can be absolved so easily!</i></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning gave haughty snort. However, he didn’t even spare Zhang Beiyu so much as a glance and acted as if she was invisible.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning’s reaction towards her caused Zhang Beiyu’s flushed face to instantly pale and her eyes filled with tears, making her look as if someone had bullied her. Chenyi was an incredibly astute woman, and she immediately realised that something was off between the two of them. She looked back and shot a vicious glare at Zhang Beiyu before she turned to face Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin with a dazzling smile. “Miss Shen, are you here to look at some jade pieces? I often come here, so I know more about these things. Would you like me to help you with your selection? That way you can avoid choosing something unsuitable.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin shot a glance at her.</p>
 <p><i>Was this woman making fun of her by saying she wasn’t knowledgeable?</i></p>
