 <p><strong>Chapter 70: A Knight In Shining Armor (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the inclusion of the chatterbox Jiang Weiwei, conversation within the group suddenly became very lively. During this time, Jiang Weiwei’s classmates came looking for her, but the woman turned out to have the same morals. She refused to move an inch after laying eyes on the beauty that was Shen Jingbin, and insisted on latching onto their group no matter what. Thus, she decisively abandoned her friends for the sake of staying with Shen Jingbin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the group of three turned into a group of four when they walked out of Starbucks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After they left, Zhao Chengning went by himself to get the car, leaving the three of them by the roadside as they waited for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen and Jiang Weiwei stood in front of Shen Jingbin almost unconsciously. Shen Jingbin did a double take when she saw this. Shen Jingchen being protective of his little sister was normal, but why would Jiang Weiwei do such a thing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Weiwei felt Shen Jingchen’s gaze on her and smiled, but didn’t say a word.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beauties should naturally be protected.</span></i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin glanced at the both of them and looked down. She was about to say something when a scooter nearby caught her eye.</p>
 <p>Since this was within the university, there weren’t many vehicles on the road. As a result, the scooter behind them was particularly conspicuous. The two leaning on the scooter appeared to be youths that weren’t even over twenty. Their hair was dyed in multitudes of colors and they were totally dressed like a bunch of hooligans.</p>
 <p>The two youths immediately straddled their scooter when they saw that Shen Jingbin had taken notice of them.</p>
 <p>A sense of foreboding suddenly arose within Shen Jingbin’s heart.</p>
 <p>“Weiwei, do you want to exchange places and stand a little further in? There’s…”</p>
 <p>Before she had the chance to finish, the trio heard a rumble and felt a gust of wind whoosh by their ears. A blurry shadow flit past them, and a second later, they found that Jiang Weiwei, who was the closest to the road, had lost the bag on her shoulder.</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei was carrying a sling bag today. With it dangling loosely on her shoulder, the snatch thieves were able to easily pull it off her as they rode past.</p>
 <p>In general, the security within the campus was pretty good, so no one would’ve expected there to be snatch thieves.</p>
 <p>By the time she came to her senses, a distance of several meters had opened up between them.</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei immediately shrieked, “Ah! Thieves!”</p>
 <p>Since she she’d seen it coming, Shen Jingbin was able to respond at the first possible moment. Without a second thought, she aimed the clutch bag in her hand at the young pillion rider, and threw it.</p>
 <p>Years of practicing martial arts had given Shen Jingbin much more strength than what she appeared to have, and the force of her attack immediately knocked the pillion rider off the scooter the moment it hit him.</p>
 <p>“F**K!” Upon seeing his comrade’s plight, the rider immediately swerved the scooter, intent on rescuing him.</p>
 <p>However, Shen Jingbin had used this opportunity to dart over to their side. Without a second thought, she bent her knee and sent it flying towards the pillion rider who was struggling to get up.</p>
 <p>His chin had just so happened to knock into Shen Jingbin’s knee when she let loose her attack, and he suddenly felt a wave of acute pain assault him. It felt as though his entire chin was shattered and everything before him turned black. As he slipped out of consciousness, his body fell to the ground once more, no longer able to move.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, his other accomplice had drawn closer to her. Shen Jingbin reacted extremely quickly and retreating a step backwards, she raised her leg and kicked him off the scooter with a roundhouse kick.</p>
 <p>The scooter fell a few metres away due to inertia, and the youth fell heavily onto the ground. The force of Shen Jingbin’s attack sent him rolling a little further away before he lay there groaning in pain.</p>
 <p>“What’re you standing around for? Call the cops!” Everything had happened so quickly that Shen Jingchen and Jiang Weiwei were left in a daze. They stood gaping at her as she completed a series of movements that were comparable to those seen in an action movie.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen was the first to recover his senses. He hurriedly took out his phone and dialled the police. Jiang Weiwei also came to her senses shortly after. She ran to Shen Jingbin’s side and saw that the two snatch thieves lay prone on the ground, groaning in pain. She blurted out, “What the f*ck, Gorgeous aren’t you a little too brave?! It looked just like a movie!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin bent down and retrieved Jiang Weiwei’s stolen bag from the thief’s hands. Returning it to the owner, she said, “I wanted to warn you just now, but I wasn’t able to do so in time.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei took her bag and caressed it with her hands, still feeling perturbed over what had happened. “Oh, my darling. Sniff sniff… Good thing I had you around today, Gorgeous, otherwise I’d already have broken down in tears. This is the newest Louis Vuitton bag that I’ve had to scrimp and save for for a week just so I could buy it.”</p>
 <p>When Zhao Chengning drove over, the first thing that caught his eye was the devastation that was wrought. He immediately stopped by the road side and walked over to Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>After casting a glance at the two youths on the ground, he looked her up and down in a slightly worried manner and asked, “Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>He only managed to calm himself down after seeing Shen Jingbin nod her head in affirmation. He then turned to looked at Jiang Weiwei who was clasping her bag in both hands. He furrowed his brows and asked, “What happened?”</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei immediately wailed and cried out, “F*ck, my beautiful self was almost scared to death! You didn’t see it, but these two suddenly popped up out of nowhere and ran off with my bag! Luckily for me, I had Gorgeous around to help. She charged straight at them without a second thought and then… <i>‘pa! pa! pa!’</i> she sent them flying in just a few hits,” Jiang Weiwei threw herself at Shen Jingbin once again and said, “Gorgeous you’re so awesome! Where’d you learn those moves of yours from? Take me as your disciple!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked at Zhao Chengning, feeling a little unsure of what to do.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning’s brows furrowed even more. He pushed Jiang Weiwei aside and said, “Go play somewhere else.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Shen Jingchen came running over and said, “I’ve called the cops. They’ll be here soon,” He shifted his gaze downwards to the snatch thieves lying on the ground and continued, “We can’t just leave them lying here like this. Do we have a rope or something? We need to tie them up.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning surveyed his surroundings and spotted a convenience store. He looked to Jiang Weiwei and said, “Go to that convenience store and ask if they have anything we can use to tie people up.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei obeyed his command and ran over to the convenience store.</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei’s cry of alarm had caused many of the passersby, including those who were drinking coffee in the vicinity, to look over. They had personally witnessed the scene of “a beauty punishing the bandits”. A man dressed as a Starbucks employee raised his voice and said to them, “Our store has ropes!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen looked at that man and said, “That’ll do. I’ll follow you and get it, thanks!”</p>
 <p>While walking to Starbucks, the man heard what Shen Jingchen said and scratched his head in embarrassment. “It’s alright. That girl in your group is really amazing, she’s a true talent!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, it’s nothing, it’s nothing. She only practices some martial arts.”</p>
 <p>After Shen Jingchen left, Zhao Chengning shifted his gaze back to the person in front of him and said, “You were too hasty. Did you imagine what might have happened if you’d gotten injured?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin said, “I knew I wouldn’t get injured, that’s why I attacked.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so hasty in the future. There’s only one of you in the world and this sort of thing is too dangerous.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was about to retort, but swallowed her words when she glanced at the cold expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“Okay.”</p>
 <p><i>What the f*ck!? Why’d she suddenly become so terrified of him?!</i></p>
