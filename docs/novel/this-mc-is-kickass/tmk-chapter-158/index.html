 <p><b>Chapter 158: Hundred Daybreaks (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>When Hundred Daybreaks saw them exchanging “flirtatious glances” as she set her book aside, a momentary surge of anger welled up in her chest and she said rather unkindly, “Can you not make googly eyes in front of me? So, why the visit?”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast sat opposite Hundred Daybreaks and motioned for Shen Jingbin to sit beside him.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin eyed Hundred Daybreaks. Hundred Daybreaks had thought that she was being extremely secretive, but the reality now proved otherwise. All of her furtive glances had been caught by Shen Jingbin, who was confidently seated next to Quiet And Steadfast.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt that Hundred Daybreaks ought to have some sentimental feelings for Quiet And Steadfast.</p>
 <p><i>Don’t ask her why she was so sure about it. It was a woman’s intuition!</i>“</p>
 <p>“You seem a little angry today,” Quiet And Steadfast pointed out as soon as he sat down. He could also sense that Hundred Daybreaks was acting a little strangely today.</p>
 <p>Hundred Daybreaks expression faltered. “Really? It’s all in your head.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin pursed her lips.&nbsp;<i>You’re lying through your teeth.</i></p>
 <p>“So why’d you come looking for me?”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t come to ask you about anything this time. Instead, I’ve come to share some information with you and I need you to find a way to spread it.”</p>
 <p>Hundred Daybreaks looked very interested. “Oh, what kind of information do you have for me? Tell me a bit about it, I won’t help you if it’s nothing of value. After all, I’m not going to risk ruining my reputation just to spread some pointless information.”</p>
 <p>The corners of Quiet And Steadfast’s eyes crinkled downwards to meet his smile. “Don’t worry, it’s definitely important.”</p>
 <p>“Then tell me what it is first.”</p>
 <p>“Those who have died twice at the hands of others will be converted into members of the Demonic Sect without fail. We can now confirm that Reckless East Emperor from Sovereign’s Descent is part of the Demonic Sect.”</p>
 <p>Hundred Daybreaks raised her delicate eyebrows. “Are you sure? Do you have anything to back up what you’ve said?”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast looked at Shen Jingbin who was sitting beside him and said, “She can prove it.”</p>
 <p>Hundred Daybreaks no longer tried to cover the glances that she was sending Shen Jingbin’s way, and instead now gazed openly at her as she asked, “What proof do you have?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin took out the clue that she’d gotten. Most people in the game knew that she was the Lead Disciple of White Cloud Temple as unlike Quiet And Steadfast, there wasn’t much of a need for her to conceal her identity.</p>
 <p>“I got this clue when I was exploring the Demonic Sect map. I killed Reckless East Emperor when I met him in Hell, causing him to disappear. Now that I think about it, he was probably transported to the Demonic Sect,” Shen Jingbin explained.</p>
 <p>However, Hundred Daybreaks didn’t seem to pay attention to her explanation. Instead, she said, “Hell? You don’t even let the dead slip through your fingers. A person’s heart is reflected in their appearance. Sure enough, this saying was right.”</p>
 <p><i>Fuck!&nbsp;</i>This time she knew for sure that Hundred Daybreaks was deliberately taunting her.</p>
 <p>Since that was the case, she wouldn’t tolerate Hundred Daybreaks any longer even if she was Quiet And Steadfast’s friend!</p>
 <p>“Ugly. It looks like this phrase applies to you too.”</p>
 <p>“Quiet And Steadfast, your wife has quite the sharp tongue,” Hundred Daybreaks immediately brought Quiet And Steadfast into the conversation when Shen Jingbin refuted her.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s face sank. It seemed as though Hundred Daybreaks was an expert at driving a wedge between people.</p>
 <p><i>If Quiet And Steadfast dared to give her any attitude, she’d immediately throw the medicinal pills she had in her bag at his face.&nbsp;</i></p>
 <p>Thankfully, Quiet And Steadfast didn’t show any signs of discontent towards her and instead spoke sternly to Hundred Daybreaks.</p>
 <p>“Hundred Daybreaks, don’t talk to me about these pointless things.”</p>
 <p>When Quiet And Steadfast told her off, Hundred Daybreaks’ gave an unhappy click of her tongue and said, “Tsk, a married couple really is of one mind.”</p>
 <p>“I understand. I’ll accept this information and publicize it when the time’s right. You should be satisfied now, right?”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s expression lightened when he heard this. “Then I’ll be troubling you.”</p>
 <p>“If you know you’re troubling me, then treat me to a meal in real life,” At this point, Hundred Daybreaks glanced at Shen Jingbin, seemingly pleased with herself. She seemed to be saying,&nbsp;<i>Look, I know your husband in real life.</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt like rolling her eyes.&nbsp;<i>Why are you bragging to me about this? Do you think that this would make me jealous? Tsk, you’re too innocent, little girl. I’m not foolish enough to have genuine feelings for someone in a game!</i></p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast didn’t know why he felt a little guilty when he heard what Hundred Daybreaks said. He looked at Shen Jingbin standing beside him and felt a little upset when he saw how unaffected she seemed.</p>
 <p>“I’ll talk to you again some other day. I’ve already given you the information, so we’ll be heading off first.”</p>
 <p>He stood up and made to leave. Yet when Shen Jingbin got up and was about to leave Hundred Daybreaks abruptly called out to her.</p>
 <p>“Nutjob, wait a moment. I have something I want to say to you.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast was already at the door when he turned around and furrowed his brows. “What are you up to?”</p>
 <p>Hundred Daybreaks gazed at him. “Why are you so nervous? Do you think I’ll eat her up? Relax, it’ll only take two minutes. Just wait for a while.”</p>
 <p>“Wait for me outside,” Shen Jingbin was very curious about what she had to say.</p>
 <p>Since Shen Jingbin put it that way, Quiet And Steadfast didn’t object any further and just said, “Call me if there’s anything,” before he left the room.</p>
 <p>When the door closed behind him, Shen Jingbin looked down at Hundred Daybreaks from where she was standing. “So, what did you want to talk about?”</p>
 <p>Hundred Daybreak’s lips curled upwards. “Do you know how many people are on the leaderboard for ugly women?”</p>
 <p>“Does this have anything to do with me?”</p>
 <p>“Sigh. This obviously has something to do with you since you’re at the top of the leaderboard. You don’t know about it, do you? In that case, I’ll tell you about it. There are only 10 female players in the entire game who managed to get onto the ugly leaderboard. After all, someone who’s ugly in this game is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. You’re rather impressive for managing to nab first place.”</p>
 <p>“You asked me to stay back just to say this? Just how bored are you?” Shen Jingbin said as she shot a look of disdain at Hundred Daybreaks.</p>
 <p>“Of course, that’s not all. I just wanted to remind you that Quiet And Steadfast is no ordinary person. A poor person like you isn’t fit for him. So, allow me to offer you a word of advice: don’t think you’re some big-shot just because you’re married to him in-game. You have no right to be by his side.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin coldly laughed. “Ha, so what? No matter what you say, I’m still the one who’s married to him in-game. And, even if I’m not fit to be by his side, I’m still more worthy than you.”</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>“You’re just saying all this because you don’t have any confidence in yourself and are using me to boost your confidence. You’re barking up the wrong tree. If we’re talking about qualifications, you should know better than me who’s the one who doesn’t have any.”</p>
 <p>After saying this, without giving Hundred Daybreaks a chance to retort, Shen Jingbin turned around, opened the door, and left; leaving Hundred Daybreaks fuming behind her.</p>
