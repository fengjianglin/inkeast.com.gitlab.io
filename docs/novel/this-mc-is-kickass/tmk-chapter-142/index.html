 <p><b>Chapter 142: The Girl’s Actions (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin felt like her heart was threatening to burst out of her chest. Every successive beat of her heart became abnormally quick. She did her best to tread lightly and not make a sound as she neared the door in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her instincts told her that that was Shen Jingchen’s room!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew full well that she shouldn’t be up here, but she still wanted to take a look. Either way, her Mother was far too busy preparing dinner to keep an eye on her. Furthermore, she had heard from her Mother that the siblings should be upstairs playing games at this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she had never played &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; before, she had heard of it. While playing it, they wouldn’t be able to hear anything from their surroundings unless someone touched their gaming pod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Which was why this was the best opportunity for her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After tomorrow’s test, she’d have to return with her school, so today was her last night here. Although she wasn’t able to do anything, she still wanted to have a look at his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She might even be able to get a better idea of how he was like from looking at his room. She might be able to find out things such as his favorite colour, whether he preferred soccer or basketball, his favorite movie star etc. As the saying goes: If you know yourself and know your enemy, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. This tactic was applicable when it came to love as well. Her chances of getting together with him would be increased if she just got to know him better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t be blamed for resorting to such a tactic. Shen Jingchen wouldn’t even talk to her and refused to let her even get to know him better. This was why she had to resort to desperate measures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the door right in front of her, Qu Yanxin couldn’t help but inhale a deep breath in an attempt to suppress her wildly beating heart. Raising a hand, she gently placed it onto the door handle and turned it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The door was locked!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin’s shoulders instantly slumped in defeat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could she have been so silly and overlooked the fact that he might have locked the door!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Rapping herself on her head in frustration, Qu Yanxin dejectedly turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little did she know that the moment she turned around, her gaze would be met with a pair of chilling eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These eyes were extremely pretty. In fact, they could have been the prettiest eyes she’d ever seen in her entire life. Long, brush-like eyelashes covered pupils that were full of emotion. They were truly a pair of expressive, soul-snaring eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, this pair of expressive eyes were currently staring at her coldly. Not a single ripple could be seen within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang!” Qu Yanxin felt as if someone had dumped a pail of cold water over her. A rush of cold air spread from her toes and went straight towards her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if her once rapidly beating heart had suddenly stopped, causing her to feel a wave of dizziness that even extended to her vision and distorted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bi-Big Sister Shen,” Under Shen Jingbin’s chilling gaze, Qu Yanxin barely managed to open her mouth to greet her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing here?” Shen Jingbin threw open her door and leaned against the doorframe with her arms folded. Her slightly messy, half-dried hair even imparted an aura of cold arrogance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I...I came up to look for the two of you...” Qu Yanxin’s mind went into overdrive, desperately trying to think of a way to extricate herself from her predicament. “It’s almost dinner time, so I came up to see if the two of you were busy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They usually had dinner late, having their meal at around 7pm. But now...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin raised her wrist to look at the time, but found that it only just past 5pm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked back at Qu Yanxin with a smile that wasn’t quite one and said, “Did you check the time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I…” Qu Yanxin was at a loss for words and didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, the sound of a door unlocking rang out from behind her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh no!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin’s heart chilled by another few degrees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that someone was standing in front of his door, Shen Jingchen shifted his gaze and saw his sister leaning against her own door with a chilling expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Shen Jingchen asked, subconsciously frowning. “Qu Yanxin, why are you here? Didn’t we tell you not to come up to the second floor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin slowly turned her body to face him with reddened eyes and wore an expression that looked as if she’d suffered an unspeakable grievance, “B-B-Big Brother Shen...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen didn’t like it when girls cried, especially when it was a girl he wasn’t close to.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If you’ve been bullied, then go and look for the person who caused it. Why are you crying in front of me? Don’t tell me you’re hoping that I’ll go and take care of the person who did it to you? Don’t joke with me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you crying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Shen, I’m-I’m sorry. I was just curious and wanted to come up to take… a look,” Qu Yanxin said as she stuttered through her sobs. “I’ve never seen… such, a-a wonderful house, so I couldn’t help myself and came up. I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s brows knitted even closer together. “Speak properly, what are you crying for? We haven’t even said anything yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin glanced at Shen Jingbin out of the corner of her eyes before she retracted her gaze and continued sobbing. It was as though she was saying: </span><i><span style>She bullied me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen raised his head to look at Shen Jingbin and asked with his eyes: </span><i><span style>What’s going on here?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shrugged. </span><i><span style>Beats me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen: </span><i><span style>F**K, she’s crying and you’re telling me you don’t know?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was at a loss. </span><i><span style>She started crying the moment you came out, she was perfectly fine when I was here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen glared at her: </span><i><span style>You’re saying I was the one who scared her to tears?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin: </span><i><span style>I didn’t say that, you said it yourself.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The siblings communicated with their eyes and ignored Qu Yanxin altogether. In a moment of guilt, Qu Yanxin sobbed even harder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang, who had been busy the entire time, was alarmed by the sobs and hastily made her way up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the matter? What’s going on? Why are you crying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom!” Upon seeing her Mother, Qu Yanxin felt as though she’d been given salvation and leapt straight into her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Jing, Little Chen, what’s going on?” Aunt Zhang looked to the siblings and asked as she patted her daughter’s back to console her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I found her sneaking up here, so I casually asked her why and she started crying,” Shen Jingbin said as she honestly recounted the series of events.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang was stunned. She turned to look at Shen Jingchen once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen felt extremely wronged. “Don’t look at me Auntie, she just started crying when I appeared at the door.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang looked down at her own daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang, who’d always been able to tell what her daughter was thinking, instantly saw through the guilt on her tear-stricken face and her heart dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew exactly what had happened.</span></p>
