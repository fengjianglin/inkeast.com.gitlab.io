 <p><strong>Chapter 82: Godly Senior Sister! (2)&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin had no intention of arguing with Morning Glory Chime. After all, the item was already in her hands. No matter what, the outcome wouldn’t change even if Morning Glory Chime continued to kick up a fuss. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I’m Not A Monster agreed and left the dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s vision blurred, and the next thing they knew, they were once again standing at the entrance of Blood Soaked Hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s add each other as friends. Can you bring me along when you guys run dungeons in the future?” Morning Glory Chime asked the moment they left the dungeon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After partying with her for three dungeons, everyone from Jade Sea Pavilion had lost all of their initial goodwill towards her and found all sorts of excuses to reject her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, my friend list is full.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t run dungeons often. I prefer hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, my friends are all guys. My wife is the only female friend I have! I don’t add other female players apart from my wife!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm, we’ll meet again if we’re fated. There’s no need to add me as a friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p>After rejecting Morning Glory Chime’s friend request, everyone took the opportunity to flee in succession. While waiting for Quiet And Steadfast to arrive, Shen Jingbin loitered around the entrance of the dungeon as the two of them helplessly eyed each other.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly turned to her and asked, “Do you want me to add you as a friend?”</p>
 <p>Once the Jade Sea Pavilion members had left, the pitiful expression on Morning Glory Chime’s face disappeared. In its place was disdain and arrogance. She glared hatefully at Shen Jingbin and said, “Are you making fun of me? Are you laughing at me for losing to an ugly monster like you?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was speechless. “How does it look like I’m making fun of you?”</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime coldly snorted, “Do you think you’re really that good at pretending? That face of yours makes me feel disgusted.”</p>
 <p><i>You self-centered show off! </i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin really felt like hitting her.</p>
 <p>“Then don’t look at me.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve got some bad news for you,” Morning Glory Chime suddenly gave a sinister laugh. “I’ve already asked my guild members to come over. You’ve got the next few minutes to reconsider handing the Lava Herb and Vermillion Bird’s Tear over to me.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin glanced at her and felt that this should be how she was really like. “You’ve had your eye on me ever since we entered the dungeon, right?”</p>
 <p>“You’re pretty clever.”</p>
 <p>“You’re not half bad at acting yourself. You didn’t seem to be so… obedient when I first met you.”</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime brushed her beautiful jet-black hair to the side and said, “All guys like a girl who’s a little obedient. How could I get them to be at my beck and call if I don’t put up a bit of a front?”</p>
 <p>“What a pity, it looks like you walked into a brick wall today. You didn’t manage to get your claws on a single guy, did you?”</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime became infuriated when Shen Jingbin pointed this out. Not only had the male players of Jade Sea Pavilion remained indifferent to her antics, they had paid a great deal of attention to an ugly monster the entire time!</p>
 <p>“Shut up! What right does an ugly monster like you have to mock me?!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin spread out her hands. “Let me ask you a question: do you know who your other party members were?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care who they are. All I need to know is that they’re high-level players who can carry me.”</p>
 <p>“That was your biggest mistake. You didn’t do a background check on the other party before fooling around with them.”</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime’s charming face immediately flushed red in anger. Her lips slightly parted, intent on saying something, when she was suddenly interrupted by a voice behind her.</p>
 <p>“Morning Glory, you said someone bullied you. Where are they?! Your elder brothers will help you take care of her!”</p>
 <p>The members of Morning Glory Chime’s guild had arrived.</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime eyed Shen Jingbin smugly before she promptly revealed a pitiful look on her face. “Elder Brother Wallet, she’s the one bullying me.”</p>
 <p>The full name of the person Morning Glory Chime referred to as ‘Elder Brother Wallet’ was ‘I Forgot My Wallet’. He was a high leveled Daoist that looked rather handsome.</p>
 <p>I Forgot My Wallet swung his horsetail whisk as he stepped forward. When he saw Shen Jingbin, the expression on his face immediately turned into one of astonishment. “What the f*ck?! It’s Great Senior Sister!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly stumbled. “Who the f*ck are you? Why’re you calling me Great Senior Sister?!”</p>
 <p>I Forgot My Wallet took several large strides towards Shen Jingbin and grabbed her by the sleeve. “Great Senior Sister! You’re my Great Senior Sister!”</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime was struck dumb by this god-like development. “Elder Brother Wallet, what are you doing?! Why are you acting so chummy towards this ugly monster?! She’s the one who bullied me!”</p>
 <p>I Forgot My Wallet whipped his head around and roared at Morning Glory Chime, “What do you know! This is our Great Senior Sister from White Cloud Temple! Our Sect Leader just announced that Great Senior Sister has made an amazing achievement recently! He wants the full cooperation of everyone in the White Cloud Temple! If not, he’ll personally deal with us! He’s the f*cking Sect Leader of White Cloud Temple! He’d be looking down on me even as he disposed of me!”</p>
 <p><i>She’s my mother f*cking awesome Senior Sister!</i></p>
 <p>There were three Daoists, including I Forgot My Wallet, amongst the members of Morning Glory Chime’s guild. The other two Daoists followed suit after I Forgot My Wallet threw himself at Shen Jingbin’s feet. One was pulling her other sleeve, whilst the other tugged at the hem of her Daoist robe. They cried out pitifully at her while addressing her as “Great Senior Sister”.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was weak against passionate people. She attempted to pull one of them up with her hand and said, “Get up first! I have no idea what’s going on. Explain yourselves!”</p>
 <p>She only had two hands, but there were three people in front of her, leaving her no physical way out of this situation. Morning Glory Chime and several other passersby were completely flabbergasted by the scene in front of them as they stood there and stared blankly at them.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Shen Jingbin heard Quiet And Steadfast’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Oh wifey, so this is where you… are you having a foursome?”</p>
 <p><i>To hell with your foursome!!!</i></p>
