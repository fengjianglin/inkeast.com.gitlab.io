 <p><b>Chapter 317: The Final Battle (1)</b></p>
 <p>“There are seven sufferings in life: birth, associating with those we dislike, leaving one’s love, being unable to attain what we desire, disease, old age, and death. The sufferings of birth comes in five forms: The first is pregnancy. When a woman is pregnant, the fetus inside the woman’s womb is subjected to a cramped and dirty environment.</p>
 <p>The second is fertilization. The fetus is formed through the union of its Father’s sperm and a Mother’s egg. While the fetus is within the Mother’s womb, it is entirely dependant on its Mother and lacks freedom.</p>
 <p>The third form is growth. During the fetus’ ten months of incubation, the womb is hot, making the fetus feel like it’s being cooked alive. As it continues to grow, it is inundated with the filth inside the mother’s womb.</p>
 <p>The fourth is when the baby is born. For the first time, the baby is subjected to the elements and the sensation of clothes brushing against its tender skin; similar to how a person would feel when they’re stabbed.</p>
 <p>The fifth form is circumstances. A person can be born with high or low moral standing. Their body may be whole or disabled, and they may either be beautiful or ugly. These are the sufferings of birth.”</p>
 <p>A string of awkward sounding words came flying out of Su Qing’s mouth, rendering everyone dumbstruck. Su Qing sighed. “Every person faces their hardships in life, and these occurrences aren’t uncommon. Bemoaning one’s lot in life won’t change anything, and since it can’t be changed, why not focus on what’s before you instead?”</p>
 <p>The Winds Of Ximen looked like he didn’t quite get it. He turned to Pure Crane who was beside him and asked in a whisper, “What was he talking about just now?”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane thought for a little while before he replied, “He’s referring to the saying: if you can’t fight against it, then you might as well enjoy it.”</p>
 <p>The Winds Of Ximen looked like he still didn’t really get it.</p>
 <p>Su Qing gave a wave of his long sleeve, and the circle of people behind him disappeared without a trace. He then turned to everyone and beckoned them. “Come over.”</p>
 <p>The group complied and went to where he was.</p>
 <p>“Shinra Sect’s Jue Tian is someone who has broken free from the cycle of life and death. Destroying him is an extremely difficult task. But, if we don’t get rid of him, the Shinra Sect will always remain.”</p>
 <p>“He’s broken free from the cycle of life and death? Doesn’t that mean we won’t be able to do anything against him?” Shen Jingbin asked.</p>
 <p>Su Qing shook his head. “All living creatures can be overcome. There’s a way to defeat him, but…”</p>
 <p>“But it’s very difficult, right?” The Winds Of Ximen asked.</p>
 <p>“Do you know why Poison Toad tasked you with finding me? It’s because I’m in charge of Reincarnation Pagoda, and it’s the only thing that can truly destroy Jue Tian. Everyone says that Reincarnation Pagoda has seven floors, but in reality, there are eight floors. The only thing is that it’s impossible to open up the eighth floor unless certain conditions are met. Even I, the Master of Reincarnation Pagoda, have no way around this.” Su Qing pulled out the plaque that Quiet And Steadfast had previously given him and weighed it in his hand. “Opening the eighth floor requires three items: the Immortal Transformation Plaque, Magic Stone, and Wooden Figurine. Back then, the Mara Hall and Lich Palace were in charge of searching for these three items, but in the end, they only managed to find the Immortal Transformation Plaque before the situation got out of hand. When that happened, they had no choice but to put off the search for the other two items and turn their attention to dealing with the Shinra Sect instead.”</p>
 <p>“Then, does that mean that once we find the Magic Stone and Wooden Figurine, we’ll be able to open up the eighth floor and destroy Jue Tian once and for all?” Quiet And Steadfast asked.</p>
 <p>“Can you tell us what these two items look like?” Pure Crane added.</p>
 <p>“You can’t judge a book by its cover; these two items look nothing out of the ordinary. To your average person, they would look like a broken rook and damaged plaque…”</p>
 <p>An idea sparked in Shen Jingbin’s mind while Su Qing was in the midst of speaking. She thought back to that broken rock and plaque that the system had given her when she’d first started playing and hurriedly pulled them out. “Could you perhaps be referring to these two items?”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Su Qing looked dubiously at the items Shen Jingbin held up before him. He then took them in his hands and carefully inspected them. His expression turned serious, and he used one hand to form a hand sign over the items.</p>
 <p>“These… these are the real things!” Su Qing exclaimed. “Never would I have expected that these items, which we’ve been searching for so many years, would actually end up in your hands!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin silently mocked up.&nbsp;<i>“Heheh, it’s the system’s divine providence, after all, so you guys obviously wouldn’t be able to find it.”</i></p>
 <p>Everyone else stared at Shen Jingbin like they’d just seen a ghost.</p>
 <p><i>What the f*ck, this girl’s practically a bug-like existence! The man had just said that these items were incredibly difficult to find, and here she is pulling them out the very next moment!</i></p>
 <p>The hell! Now they definitely knew who they were going to cling to in the future!</p>
 <p>Su Qing excitedly stood up and issued a quick reminder before he hurriedly left. “Since the items have been found, we can begin preparations to open the eighth floor! Just remember, you’ll have to lure Jue Tian over to Reincarnation Pavilion if you want to destroy him!”</p>
 <p>At the same time, the group received a system notification.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations to you and your party for finding Jue Tian’s fatal weakness. The battle between good and evil will begin once the Divine Weapons have been forged and the number of players within the Shinra Sect has reached its limit. Please continue to do your best.”</p>
 <p><i>Why did it feel like trouble was brewing on the horizon?</i></p>
 <p>Although the New Year holidays still hadn’t ended, the Shen siblings break was already over. They had no choice but to rejoin the ranks of the working class. Ye Linfan had taught them whatever he could, so he sent in his leave request to Papa Shen and had gone on holiday. Now, B City’s branch office was officially in the hands of the siblings.</p>
 <p>For now, matters in the game had to be put on hold. At present, Pure Crane needed to forge Divine Weapons for the rest of the Lead Disciples, and they still needed to wait for the Shinra sect to hit its target of one thousand disciples.</p>
 <p>Partway through the forging process, Pure Crane found out that there wasn’t enough Floating Light Silk, so Quiet And Steadfast helped out by leading a group of players from Jade Sea Pavilion to defeat the Universal Envoy. From this, Jade Sea Pavilion and Bronze Tree’s alliance was officially established.</p>
