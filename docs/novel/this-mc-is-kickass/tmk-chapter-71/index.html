Details inside!</span></span></strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 71: Life’s Twists And Turns (1)</strong><span style>B City’s police were a lot more efficient than Shen Jingbin had thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the two snatch thieves were tied up, it took less than ten minutes before the police appeared in front of the crowd. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As they were involved in the incident, Shen Jingbin’s group of four were requested to provide their account of what had happened at the police station.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The officer assigned to Shen Jingbin was a beautiful policewoman. After inspecting the footage from the street cameras, the policewoman had this constant twinkle in her eyes whenever she looked at Shen Jingbin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning and co were already waiting for her in the police station’s lounge by the time she’d finished giving her account of the incident. The policewoman sent them to the door and patted Shen Jingbin on the shoulder while saying, “You’ve got a bright future ahead of you, young girl! You can look for me if you ever feel like becoming a police officer in the future!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin silently thought to herself about how her Grandma and Grandpa would cry tears of sorrow if she ever decided to become a police officer.</span></p>
 <p>It was close to one in the afternoon when they stepped out of the police station and they were all famished.</p>
 <p>“Why not have a meal at one of the restaurants in my family’s hotel? Think of it as my way of saying thanks for all the help the beautiful Miss Shen has given me!” Jiang Weiwei proposed.</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei’s family was in the hotel industry, and a quite a number of B City’s high-end hotels were owned by them.</p>
 <p>They had nothing in mind anyway, so the four of them came to a decision and made their way towards one of the hotels that Jiang Weiwei’s family ran.</p>
 <p>After selecting the closest hotel to where they were staying, Zhao Chengning drove them over.</p>
 <p>As they approached the hotel’s entrance, Shen Jingchen caught sight of several enormous notice boards beside it. He turned around to Jiang Weiwei, who was sitting in the back seat, and asked, “What kind of event is going on?”</p>
 <p>Jiang Weiwei had a look of bewilderment on her face. “Event? What event? Who’s holding an event?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen: ...</p>
 <p>The group of four finally managed to make out the contents of the notice boards when their car drew closer.</p>
 <p>It turned it to be a notice board for &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;.</p>
 <p>“Eh? Why would there be a notice board for &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; here? I haven’t heard anything about a new event,” Jiang Weiwei whispered to herself as she looked at the notice board.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbing glanced at her and asked, “You play this game?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah. It’s been popular for the past few years, so of course I’d play it. On top of that, I’m a rising star in the game!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly felt that she looked very familiar upon noticing the way she tilted her chin upwards and made her proclamation, brimming with confidence. “Can you tell me what your in-game name is?” Shen Jingbin asked.</p>
 <p>“Sure, my in-game name is Slight Chill. You definitely have to look for me if you ever decide to play, Miss Shen! I’ll power level you!”</p>
 <p><i>What the f*ck!?</i></p>
 <p>The two Shen siblings simultaneously choked on their saliva. Shen Jingchen in particular kept coughing, to the point where his face was flushed a deep red.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning couldn’t help but reach out a hand to help him settle down. “You alright?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen gave a small wave of his hand to show that he was alright while he gazed fixedly at Jiang Weiwei’s reflection in the rearview mirror.</p>
 <p><i>Holy shit! Slight Chill was actually Jiang Weiwei! He totally wasn’t expecting this!</i></p>
 <p>Slight Chill wasn’t all that tall in the game and had the face of a loli<i>.</i> On the other hand, a conservative estimate put Jiang Weiwei’s height at around 170cm. Her figure was akin to that of a beautiful flower vase that could take anyone’s breath away with just a glance. Actually, apart from the slight bit of resemblance that they shared when they tilted their chins upwards in arrogance, there were practically no similarities between the two of them!</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just their appearances either, even their personalities were were worlds apart!</p>
 <p>Slight Chill had a rather stubborn personality and a sharp tongue. Jiang Weiwei, on the other hand, gave the siblings a completely different impression. If one were to say that Slight Chill was a spoilt young lady, then Jiang Weiwei would definitely be a person who only had her looks going for her… in other words, she was a bimbo.</p>
 <p>There was far too much of a difference between the two of them. In fact, it was almost as if she was suffering from split personality disorder. They really couldn’t be blamed for not being able to make the connection because they were just that different!</p>
 <p>Slight Chill found the Shen siblings’ exaggerated reactions a little odd and asked, “Eh, what’s with your reactions? Do you guys play &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; as well?”</p>
 <p>The siblings shared a moment of tacit understanding before they vehemently shook their heads together and declared, “No!”</p>
 <p>Crestfallen, Jiang Weiwei replied, “What a pity. But really, the game’s pretty fun to play. You guys should give it a try.”</p>
 <p>Feeling guilty, the two siblings gave a few hollow laughs in return.</p>
 <p>By this time, the car had pulled up in front of the hotel’s entrance. Zhao Chengning passed his keys over to one of the valets by the entrance and the four of them entered the hotel.</p>
 <p>The top floor of the hotel housed a garden restaurant. After leading the group to the lift lobby, Jiang Weiwei pulled out her phone and gave the hotel’s manager a call while they waited for the lift. Shen Jingchen stood in the middle of the group, while Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin stood side by side, bringing up the rear.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin tugged at the corners of Zhao Chengning’s clothes and squeaked out a question, “Do you play it too?”</p>
 <p>Ever since she’d found out that Jiang Weiwei played &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;, Shen Jingbin suddenly realised that Zhao Chengning actually looked pretty familiar. In fact, he appeared to be increasingly familiar the more she looked at him. Those eyes of his in particular were exactly the same as the ones she remembered.</p>
 <p>A look of confusion floated up to Zhao Chengning’s face as he asked, “What game?”</p>
 <p>“&lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning lowered his head and glanced at her. “Do I look like the type of person who plays games?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin shook her head and honestly replied, “No, you look like an elite who only knows how to work.”</p>
 <p>“Thanks for the compliment.”</p>
 <p>“Was that a compliment?”</p>
 <p>“Any assessment of yours is a compliment to me.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p><i>What should I do?! My ears are burning up!</i></p>
