 <p><b>Chapter 98: Exploring The Demonic Sect (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast could only helplessly look on in confusion as Master and disciple started to bicker. He stretched out his hand and patted Shen Jingbin on the back. “That’s enough, we’ve got more pressing matters to attend to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” After hearing what he said, Shen Jingbin obediently gave a grunt of affirmation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sect Leader Song, please tell us about the Vermillion Bird.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steeling his expression, Song Yuqing said, “Alright. The two of you should have a seat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast found a place to sit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Vermillion Bird is the Divine Beast of the South. As White Cloud Temple and Sword Master Pavilion are associated with the South, the Vermillion Bird acts as the guardian for both our sects. This was also why I didn’t tell you about the Vermillion Bird at the start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Its related to Swordmaster Pavilion as well?” Shen Jingbin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Song Yuqing said as he shifted his gaze to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continued speaking, “Among the Four Divine Beasts, the Azure Dragon is the most sacred of them all, and is worshipped by the Celestials as their Divine Beast. The Vermillion Bird guards the South and protects us Humans. The Black Tortoise is proficient in the Dark Arts of the Underworld and protects both the North and the waters of Beiming. Naturally, this led to it being worshipped by the Demon race. As for the White Tiger, although it’s a Divine Beast, its aura of slaughter was too strong and its whereabouts were unknown, making it the most unique existence amongst the Four Divine Beasts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Regarding the Vermillion Bird, do you know of the saying that only one of them may exist in the world at a time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Vermillion Bird reproduces differently from the other Divine Beasts. A new Vermillion Bird may only be born after the previous generation dies. When a Vermillion Bird is born, its flames would burn like a scorching summer… That’s all I can tell you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was stunned. “Eh? That’s it? Most importantly, was anything you said even useful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Yuqing wore an enigmatic look on his face, “Everything is known only to the heavens, you’ll have to find it out on your own.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Screw you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you guys should leave, there’s still plenty of things for you to attend to,” With that, the Sect Leader proceeded to chase the two of them off. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin had a face like she’d stepped in dog shit as she was chased out of White Cloud Temple by her own Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Talking to NPCs sure is tiring, they never tell you the entire story,” Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but grumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast tried to console her, “It’s the game company’s fault.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like bombing the game company!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll buy the explosives for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them continued to ridicule the game company as they made their way towards White Cloud Temple’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they reached the gate, Quiet And Steadfast said, “I’ll be logging off first, I have some matters to attend to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on then, I just so happened to be going to the Demonic Sect’s map to play around anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she had the Demonic Sect’s entry token, she’d been far too busy and hadn’t had the chance to enter the Demonic Sect’s map yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then, stay safe and be careful, especially if you run into players from Sovereign’s Descent or Life At First Sight,” Quiet Steadfast exhorted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin nodded her and waved at him before he disappeared. She then fished out a teleportation scroll and slowly tore it apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Notification: Will you use the Demonic Sect’s teleportation scroll? Yes/No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The teleportation scroll has been successfully used.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teleportation in progress, please wait…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the familiar bout of dizziness from teleporting had subsided, Shen jingbin realised she was no longer at the entrance of White Cloud Temple. Her vision was filled with a layer of pitch black, and only a small bit of light could be seen from beneath her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling curious, Shen Jingbin took a step forward, causing the light beneath her feet to move a step forward as well. She turned to look at the spot where she’d previously been standing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good, there’s still light there.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Now she knew what was happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demonic Sect’s map was huge. Even now, some portions of the map remained unexplored by players, and this portion of the map in particular was pitch black. When players arrived at an unexplored area, that portion of the map would slowly reveal itself as they explored it, just like how it did when she took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin’s fantastic luck had landed her in an unexplored region the moment she teleported into the map. The benefit of this was that she could explore the area without worrying about running into other enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin took large steps forward, occasionally reaching out to feel up her surroundings. As she moved, the system notification continuously rang out in her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on discovering a narrow and winding road.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on discovering a river.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on discovering an ancient firmament tree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on connecting to Undying City.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After wandering about, the notifications she’d been hearing suddenly changed. A bright light appeared before her eyes and the next thing she knew, the solemn and lofty walls of a city was in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked like she’d passed from an unexplored area to an explored one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin turned back and was about to look for a different place to explore when she heard someone called out to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nutjob?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eh?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked back suspiciously and found a somewhat familiar looking man standing atop the city walls looking at her with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who is that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin wracked her brain as she tried to recall who the man was.</span></p>
