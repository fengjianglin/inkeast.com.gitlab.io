 <p><b>Chapter 116: The Goddess Attends Class (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Today’s class seems to be very energetic,” Li Qing said as her gaze swept over Shen Jingbin, pretending not to notice her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Abbess Li’s comment, Shen Jingbin hunched her back and grabbed Huajuan’s textbook, flipping it open and using it to cover her face as she asked in a small voice, “Why do I feel like I’ve been found by Abbess Li?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While pretending to be diligently taking down notes and staring fixedly at the blackboard, Xiaohe replied, “I think so too. I even saw her glancing at us a couple of times.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess, your radiance is far too dazzling. Abbess Li definitely knows you’re here,” Huajuan said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what should I do?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretend. Pretend you’re a good student who’s come for lessons. Either way, there’s way too many people in the Abbess’ class. She can’t possibly remember everyone that’s supposed to be here,” Jiangmeng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin felt that Jiangmeng’s reasonable answer was very plausible, so she straightened her back and pretended to pay attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Huajuan hurriedly said, “Hey, big sis Goddess, why don’t you just help me with my notes. I happen to have a few episodes left before I finish my Korean drama. You know I’m a bit OCD as well, so it just won’t feel right if I don’t finish it.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Huajuan’s pitiful face, Shen Jingbin swallowed her rejection and ended up nodding her head. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sigh, I’m way too soft.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of how others felt, Shen Jingbin thought that Li Qing’s lessons were rather meaningful. Although she was only helping Huajuan to take notes, she was wholeheartedly listening to the lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was listening to Li Qing talk about how marketing could be applied to real life scenarios, a small crumpled ball of paper flew over from somewhere and landed in front of her. Shen Jingbin had a slight look of bewilderment on her face as she held the little ball of paper in her hand and looked around. Unfortunately, the only thing she could see around her was a mass of heads that were studiously taking down notes. Not a person in sight was facing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For things like this, Shen Jingbin was only afraid of not being able to dodge them in time. Guessing that no one would see her do it, she pinched the paper ball with her fingers, turned around, and tossed it straight into the rubbish bin behind her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Nice, right on target.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Turning back, she acted as if nothing had happened and continued listening to the lecture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately for her, another paper ball flew over in less than ten minutes. As before, Shen Jingbin tossed it away without looking at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her movements this time around were a lot more conspicuous, causing both Xiaohe and Huajuan who were sitting by her sides to take notice. “Jingjing, what did you throw?” Xiaohe asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t know. I didn’t see,” Shen Jingbin replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk tsk tsk. The people here really are a piece of work, seizing the opportunity to...” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she finished speaking, the three of them saw another ball of paper flying over from the left out of the corner of their eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The paper ball in question drew a magnificent arc in the air, before it made a perfect stop in front of Shen Jingbin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaohe was burning with righteous indignation. “What the f*ck, this is being way too brazen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan wasn’t willing to take this lying down either. “Truly a daredevil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did any of you see who threw it?” Shen Jingbin asked with an indifferent look on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaohe and Huajuan were momentarily stunned, before they revealed looks of horror on their faces. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment the good student, Jiangmeng, eyed the three of them and asked, “What’s wrong with you guys? You look like you’re suffering from ADHD.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s someone throwing balls of paper at our Goddess right before our very eyes!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiangmeng’s eyes lit up. “Who? Point them out for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, we didn’t see,” Huajuan said as she shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Is this what you mean by ‘right before your very eyes’?” She then turned to Shen Jingbin and asked, “What was in it?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t know, I didn’t open it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then open it up and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin: ...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh miss class president, why’re you a gossip monger as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Three pairs of fluttering eyes were brimming with curiosity as they looked at her, and not having seen who threw the paper, coupled with being afraid of receiving even more of them, Shen Jingbin helplessly opened up the third ball of paper slowly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Small and graceful handwriting could be seen on the white sheet of paper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior sister, can I have lunch with you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin held her head in her hand. </span><i><span style>Seriously, forget about you disrupting class by passing balls paper around, you don’t even know how to do it in person! Not only that, you didn’t sign off and there’s no time or place mentioned, so who the hell am I supposed to throw it to when I reply?!</span></i></p>
