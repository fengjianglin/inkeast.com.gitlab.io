 <p><strong>Chapter 29: The Origins Of The Demonic Sect (1)&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Although Shen Jingbin hadn’t interacted much with Quiet and Steadfast, she felt that he was a pretty good person. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His ability to subdue Shen Jingchen was enough to prove that he wasn’t a simple person. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he’d received Old Master Shen’s guidance before it was too late, curbing much of his hedonistic tendencies, Shen Jingchen was still the Young Master of an influential family. When facing outsiders, he’d unconsciously exude a sense of superiority that felt aloof and remote. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast’s capabilities were clear from the very fact that Shen Jingchen was willing to play second fiddle to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might have been due to his authority as the guild leader, but once Quiet And Steadfast spoke out, neither Slight Chill nor Shen Jingchen spoke a word after. When the tense atmosphere began to dissolve, all the bystanders within the chat started to joke around in an attempt to wash away the previous incident.</span></p>
 <p>Shin Jingbin thought for a bit, before she pulled up her friend window and sent Quiet And Steadfast a letter, “I’ll do my best to level so that I don’t embarrass you anymore.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s reply came quickly, “Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Your Luck is good, so you’ll level quickly. Don’t worry about what happened today.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly received another letter shortly after receiving Quiet And Steadfast’s reply. She originally thought that he had something else to say, but upon opening it, she found that it was actually from Slight Chill.</p>
 <p>“Just you wait, I’ll definitely return today’s debt to you!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s lips curled. She tore apart the letter and watched as bits and pieces of it fell to the ground, before then being wiped away by the system.</p>
 <p>Throughout her growing years, due to various external factors, other women had frequently treated Shen Jingbin as a punching bag for no reason at all. Compared to them, Slight Chill’s threats towards her were a mere trifle. She wouldn’t take it to heart.</p>
 <p>Of course, that didn’t mean she was the Virgin Mary. It’s just that the other party wasn’t enough of a threat yet, so there was no need for her to worry.</p>
 <p>By this time, White Cloud Temple was in sight, so Shen Jingbin sent out a party invitation to Shen Jingchen.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen was soon flying over on his coquettish dragon shortly after the party was formed.</p>
 <p>Players who formed parties would know where their members are.</p>
 <p>The moment he landed, Shen Jingbin didn’t act like how she usually did and harshly criticize him. Instead, she smiled and curried favor with him by saying, “Big bro, you were really cool just now.”</p>
 <p>To Shen Jingbin, trying to curry favor like this was a tremendous challenge for her.</p>
 <p>But, for the sake of thanking him for what he did, she’d force herself to do it even if it was extremely difficult.</p>
 <p>The two siblings may take pleasure in the other’s misfortune, but in truth, they got along really well with one another.</p>
 <p>She knew perfectly well that her brother had gotten angry for her sake, so she naturally couldn’t just sit there and do nothing.</p>
 <p>Even if they were siblings, they would just drift apart if they took each other for granted.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen clearly enjoyed what she did, but he put on a facade of arrogance instead, shooting her a supercilious look and saying, “Hmph.”</p>
 <p>However, Shen Jingbin’s currying favor never lasted for long.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing his outrageously arrogant appearance, Shen Jingbin immediately withdrew her fawning smile before she walked up and clapped him on the shoulder, “Don’t be arrogant, child.”</p>
 <p>“...Get lost.” Shen Jingchen said through his clenched teeth, “How can you be so unconscionable, I had to give up 100 taels of silver because of you! And, in just a little bit, I’m going to get scolded by the Leader. Are you telling me that all of that was worth only this little bit of fawning?! Your big brother is very unhappy!”</p>
 <p>Although those were the words that came out of his mouth, in truth, that wasn’t the case. The smile that tugged at the corner of his lips had already revealed how he truly felt.</p>
 <p>“You really were angry just now, weren’t you?” It wasn’t a question, but a statement.</p>
 <p>“Eh, a little. That woman is really annoying and she’s always causing trouble. As you’ve said, she’s always trying to pick a fight with me, but I endured it since I’m a magnanimous person. After all, I was the one who did wrong by her first. However, bullying you is another matter altogether. Your big brother is still around. Did she really think I was a pushover? That I could be slapped around so easily?”</p>
 <p>The two of them talked as they made their way towards the interior of White Cloud Temple.</p>
 <p>The world had undergone a substantial change ever since the system released the Demonic Sect expansion. In response, the system had also gone through a huge transformation. Previously, players weren’t allowed to set foot into other sects. However, they were now permitted to come and go freely.</p>
 <p>There was an enormous amount of players in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;. Even after much time had passed from the time the new version was released, many players would still come back to their sects to pick up new quests. Unexpectedly, upon seeing the duo walk over, a majority of the players there spontaneously opened up a path for them, allowing them to enter first.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt that it was likely due to her terrifying appearance, which was so horrid that they weren’t even willing to squeeze together with her.</p>
 <p>“Is Slight Chill at odds with me because I entered the guild through the back door, and also because of the quest I did with Quiet And Steadfast yesterday?” Shen Jingbin suddenly asked as they were walking.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen replied after thinking for awhile, “That’s about right, it should be all of those things.”</p>
 <p>“...Why do I feel as if I’ve unwittingly drawn all the aggro?”</p>
 <p>“Wasn’t there an old saying that went: When heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a great man, he will first be presented with trials and tribulations to hone his nature and spirit. In that case, all these people who have it out for you are helping you pave the way to success.”</p>
 <p>A smile tugged at the corner of Shen Jingchen’s lips as he said, “I’m sorry, but your current appearance has absolutely nothing in common with the word ‘beautiful’.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s eyebrows rose, “Are you looking for a spanking?”</p>
 <p>“Ahem, today’s weather is pretty good.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
