 <p><b>Chapter 286: Setting An Example (2)</b></p>
 <p>Everyone else had left the office, leaving only Shen Jingbin, Zhao Chengning, and Ke Yuan behind, so Zhao Chengning suddenly asked, “Ke Yuan, are any of the people from the Technology Department, and the PR Department left in the office?”</p>
 <p>“Most of them have gone on leave, but there are still a few people in charge around.”</p>
 <p>“That’s good then; tell the Technology Department to drop what they’re doing and to clear up the nonsense floating around on the internet, and get the PR Department to have a chat with Yiju about this incident. I don’t wish to see any of this tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Ke Yuan grunted in reply.</p>
 <p>Now that this incident had come to a close, Zhao Chengning brought Shen Jingbin over to the General Manager’s room where they greeted Zhao Chengan before they left. Having been interrupted, the couple wasn’t in the mood to shop anymore, and instead decided to head straight home to rest.</p>
 <p>Along the way, Zhao Chengning asked worriedly, “Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin shook her head. “Even though this whole mess was a bit of a headache, I’m alright. You look like you’ve got bigger troubles though.”</p>
 <p>“Yiju probably couldn’t handle this matter promptly because their staff is on their annual leave. But, that doesn’t discount the possibility that someone is intentionally trying to cause trouble. Let me handle this, don’t you worry about it,” Zhao Chengning replied, casting a sidelong glance at her while he drove. “Does your hand still hurt?”</p>
 <p>“My hand?” Shen JIngbin raised her hand and inspected it. It looked youthful and exceedingly beautiful. “It doesn’t hurt, and I think that man’s face is hurting a lot more anyway.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning chuckled, and much of the oppressive atmosphere in the car was dispelled. “Truth be told, even I felt it just from looking at it.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin solemnly explained herself, “Don’t worry, I don’t normally hit other people. I was just too angry and couldn’t keep my cool.”</p>
 <p>“Mm. Don’t worry; I have every confidence in you. I was just wondering whether Ke Yuan might have been frightened by you.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin thought back to Zhao Chengning’s refined assistant, and her eyes widened. “Assistant Ke Yuan is a world-wise individual, right?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning turned the steering wheel to navigate the curve ahead of them. “I’m not so sure about that, he’s actually quite timid,” He said, the hint of a smile playing at his lips.</p>
 <p>Back at the office, Ke Yuan, who was in the middle of a conversation with the PR Department suddenly sneezed.</p>
 <p>“... Should I give him a big red packet to make him feel better?”</p>
 <p>“That’s workable. Give it to me, and I’ll pass it on to him. But, I’ll only accept red packets that contain 520[1.&nbsp;520 (pinyin:&nbsp;<i>wǔ èr líng</i>) in Mandarin sounds similar to "我愛你" (pinyin:&nbsp;<i>wǒ ài nǐ</i>; literally: "I love you").]&nbsp;or 1314 [2.&nbsp;1314 (pinyin:&nbsp;<i>yī sān yī sì</i>; Cantonese Yale:&nbsp;<i>yāt sāam yāt sei</i>) sounds like "一生一世" (pinyin:&nbsp;<i>yīshēngyīshì</i>; Cantonese Yale:&nbsp;<i>yāt sāng yāt sai</i>; literally: "one life one lifetime") meaning "forever" and is often used romantically.] within them.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin fell silent.&nbsp;<i>Mr Zhao, are you trying to tease me even at a time like this?</i></p>
 <p>As for whether Ke Yuan was timid, well, that remained a mystery. But, he was pretty efficient at what he did. Within less than an hour, Yiju received a fax from the Zhao family, stirring Yiju’s Director into a frenzy as he recalled which Managers from the various departments that had already gone on leave and swiftly deployed the countermeasures that they’d long since set in place.</p>
 <p>On that afternoon, &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; players found that the hottest two threads on the forums had suddenly disappeared. In fact, even articles that republished these two threads had all gone missing as well.</p>
 <p>This was then followed by the Administer of &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;, who’d previously declared that he was going to go on annual leave, now pop out of the woodwork and put up two posts on Weibo.</p>
 <p>“I was catching up on some Z’s when I was jolted awake by a string of calls. One look was all it took for me to know that shit had hit the fan. It turns out that my beautiful Great Senior Senior was being hazed! F*ck, I won’t stand for this! ヽ(｀Д´)ノ As for a certain OP, all I can say is: are you jelly or are you jelly? Great Senior Sister likes to maintain a low profile in real life, so I didn’t reveal much information about her. Little did I expect this to become an excuse for you guys to attack other people! (*￣Ｏ￣)ノ Since that’s the case, it’s time to call out the big guns. @Special Assistant Ke Yuan. Mighty Assistant, please render divine judgement upon these heathens!”</p>
 <p>“The Administrator’s rebuttal: Firstly, the beautiful Senior Sister is playing the role of White Cloud Temple’s disciple in the promotional video; it doesn’t mean that she’s the same person as the Senior Sister in-game. Don’t you guys know what an ambassador is? To those players who launch personal attacks against other people you should either apologise, or just kill yourselves. Secondly, I find this trend where people brazenly make fun of how others look completely unacceptable. From now on, threads like these will be deleted on sight. At the same time, do you guys seriously want to talk about beauty in this day and age, where photoshop and plastic surgery run rampant? Sorry, I’m blind to all of this. (=ﾟωﾟ)ノ (Of course, no one can match my beautiful Senior Sister!)”</p>
 <p>The first post was directed towards Nutjob, while the second addressed Shen Jingbin. As people were slightly more interested in Shen Jingbin, the second post was pinned the moment it went up.</p>
 <p>The account Ke Yuan registered under was ‘Special Assistant To The Zhao Group’s CEO’. Normally, he’d only be involved in sending out some internal circulars to the Zhao Group or things like recruitment notices. But now, the countless onlookers that had followed the Administrator’s ping to Ke Yuan’s account found a very lengthy and eye-catching statement on his front page.</p>
 <p>In the end, Ke Yuan and the PR Department had decided that the best way to deal with this was to just reveal Shen Jingbin’s identity and give them all a good slap on the face.</p>
 <p>In this day and age, the terms ‘pretty university girl’[1. Originally meant to be a phrase that describes youth, beauty, and knowledge. Now, it’s used to describe mistresses, women who use their nudes as collateral for loans, shallow women, gold diggers, and surrogate mothers.] and ‘second generation children’[2. Children that live off of their parent’s wealth.] always carry a negative connotation no matter what context they’re used in. In particular, attempting to restore a woman’s reputation was a punishingly difficult process. The only way a woman could escape from such a predicament was if she could find a way to turn her title of a ‘pretty university girl’ into a ‘miss perfect’ that had both beauty and brains.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was one such person.</p>
 <p>While Shen Jingbin was reluctant to reveal herself because she wanted to maintain a low profile, she was even less inclined to suddenly be seen as a caged bird for some unknown reason. Carrying around such a label would be an utter disgrace to herself.</p>
 <p>So, when Ke Yuan had called her up to discuss the matter, Shen Jingbin had immediately agreed to reveal her identity.</p>
