 <p><b>Chapter 284: A Disturbance On The Forums (2)</b></p>
 <p>Hua Juan and her friends secretly posting Shen Jingbin’s picture online was the initial reason why Yiju came looking for her. They forgot to delete the post later on, and now, someone from Weibo had dug it out. Someone else had also dug up a picture of her and Zhao Chengning at B City University.</p>
 <p>Many people had seen them back then, and although Ke Yuan had done his best to remove all traces of her online, his hands were tied when it came to the pictures stored in everyone’s phones. Now that the images had leaked out, everyone’s overactive imagination had resulted in them thinking up what seemed to be this year’s tumultuous drama starring the rich and powerful.</p>
 <p>“Public morals are slipping with every passing day; beauties are but playthings for the rich and powerful.”</p>
 <p>“I assume that everyone’s seen the trailer released by Yiju’s management featuring the beauty, right? I was also blown away when I saw her, but, at the same time, I was feeling a little puzzled. Logically speaking, someone as beautiful as her shouldn’t be so obscure. I later found out why: it turns out that this beauty was one of those legendary ‘birds trapped in a cage’, and her backer was the one keeping her locked up. Otherwise, there would’ve been no way for her to maintain such a low profile. （＾ｖ＾）”</p>
 <p>“Don’t think I’m out to paint other people black. You can see for yourselves; beauties these days are looking for all sorts of means to become famous or popular. And, most of them who don’t, have probably been snatched up by powerful figures. And this woman’s backer is the strongest one out there. I’m a bit of a wuss, so I’m not going to say anything else that might offend this powerful individual. Those of you who are curious though can try Baiduing [1. A Chinese search engine] who the most eligible bachelor in B City is.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve heard from various sources that this beauty is the school belle of a certain university in A City. Every single article of clothing she’s wearing is branded, and they’re likely from her backer. A question popped up in my mind when I took a look at the other thread that made fun of the real Senior Sister from White Cloud Temple. Which do you think is more disgusting: an ugly woman or a beauty that’s been kept in captivity? To me, both of them are equally disgusting. (＾ω＾)”</p>
 <p>Because of the very last thing that the original poster had said, the rest of the replies to the thread mirrored their sentiment. The number of responses to the thread slowly ballooned, and the two trending threads on the forums rose in popularity. The next day, several forums that dealt with rumours had republished the two threads and even voted on which of the two threads was more off-putting to read.</p>
 <p>By the time Yiju’s staff noticed what was happening, things had more or less spiralled out of control. The Director of the Marketing Department was so terrified that he broke out in a cold sweat, and hurriedly recalled the staff members who were on leave while simultaneously informing upper management of what had happened. The gears in his head rapidly spun as he tried to think up a solution for this situation.</p>
 <p>The others wouldn’t know, but management was painfully aware of who Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning were. These two were people that they absolutely couldn’t afford to provoke.</p>
 <p>This was brought to Zhao Chengning’s attention when someone who despised the rich tried to cause trouble by pasting a small piece of paper on the door to their office but was caught by the security guards. Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin were window-shopping when he suddenly received a call from the office. His expression instantly darkened, and he hurried back to the office. Although Shen Jingbin didn’t know what was happening, she could tell it was nothing good from the look on his face. But, in the end, Shen Jingbin still decided to go along with him.</p>
 <p>When they arrived at the office, Zhao Chengning went straight towards the room that was used to detain the perpetrator. Along the way, Ke Yuan had compiled some information and handed it over to him. After glancing through it, Zhao Chengning had a rough understanding of the situation, rendering him even more furious than he was before. When she saw his expression, Shen Jingbin was filled with curiosity and took a look at it.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt like she was about to blow her top when she saw it as well.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning’s imposing presence billowed out when he opened the door. He looked straight at a vulgar-looking man sitting on a sofa before he turned to Ke Yuan who was beside him and asked, “Where’s that thing he pasted in front of the office?”</p>
 <p>The man gave a start when he noticed their presence, but his eyes lit up the moment he saw Shen Jingbin walking in behind them. He ignored Zhao Chengning’s presence and attempted to rush over to Shen Jingbin. However, he was immediately pushed back into the soft by the two security guards around him when he jumped out of his seat. The man wasn’t willing to give up though, he struggled from his position on the sofa and shouted, “You, you’re the one! You’re really here!”</p>
 <p>The fanatical look in his eyes unsettled Shen Jingbin. Her face darkened, and she asked, “Who are you?”</p>
 <p>The man’s gaze was filled with obsession as he eyed Shen Jingbin. “Me? I’m nobody. I’m just someone who likes you… Are you really together with him? Don’t bother, princes like him are never sincere. You shouldn’t be with him… Stay with me! I’ll-I’ll treat you well!”</p>
 <p>The moment he said that Zhao Chengning’s face darkened to the point where it could even match Judge Bao’s own. Seeing this, Shen Jingbin squeezed his hand in an attempt to calm him down. That didn’t sit well with the man, and his face flushed red as he began to hurl insults at Zhao Chengning.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s eyes narrowed, and she took a step forward, looming over him as she watched the man continue his tirade. Shen Jingbin’s presence was akin to that of an empress, washing over him as she approached. The man unconsciously shut his mouth and stared dumbly at her.</p>
 <p>“So what you’re trying to say is that I can’t be with him, but it’s alright if I’m together with you? Do you think you’re worthy of me?”</p>
 <p>“I… I might not be able to match up to you now, but I’ll do my best to become a man who’s worthy of you!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked as if she’d just heard a joke. “Heh, are you still sleeping? You wouldn’t be able to match up to him even if you tried for the rest of your life,” She cast a look of disdain at the man and gave him a once over. “You’re better off facing reality now,” Shen Jingbin’s gaze laid the man bare. Unable to bear being exposed like this, the man broke out into a tirade once more.</p>
 <p>Just then, Ke Yuan came walking in with the slip of paper that the man had pasted onto the door. Zhao Chengning took the paper from him and inspected it. The corner of his lips tugged upwards into a wry smile. Curious, Shen Jingbin grabbed the piece of paper and read it. “This is a trash company! Drop dead, Zhao Chengning!”</p>
 <p>Hahaha, it looks like this man’s IQ really was lacking.</p>
