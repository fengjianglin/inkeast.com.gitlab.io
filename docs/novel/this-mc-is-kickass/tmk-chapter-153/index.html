 <p><b>Chapter 153: Horrors At Every Turn In Life (1)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Those two words instantly appeared in Shen Jingbin’s mind. She decisively released the whisk that was trapped in Lianshui’s bones and jumped back a step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pure Crane and Delicate Flower took this moment to attack Lianshui at the same time which caused her attention to be drawn towards the duo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a Daoist, many of her skills required the use of her whisk. Right now, that very whisk was embedded in Lianshui’s chest, swaying about with every movement she made. Shen Jingbin’s skills, however, were now greyed out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Isn’t this what people call ‘Trying to steal chickens, only to end up losing the rice’? She’d tried to gain an advantage but came out worse off in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light in Shen Jingbin’s eyes dimmed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t think that I can’t kill you off just because I can’t use my skills!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin opened her backpack and searched for her backup weapon. In most cases, aside from her essential horsetail whisk, she would stash some backups in her backpack. It could be a dagger or a longsword, anything would do as long as it wasn’t a weapon for Nymphs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her search yielded a longsword. In the past, when she participated in a training camp, she met a girl who was skilled in swordplay. The duo hit it off, with the girl teaching her a few sets. Shen Jingbin was extremely intelligent, so picking up the techniques had been a simple task for her. As such, her swordplay wasn’t bad either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking out her longsword, Shen Jingbin chased after Lianshui. With the slight twitch of her blade, its tip left a bloody gash on Lianshui’s arm. Roaring to the heavens with rage, Lianshui turned and attempted to pounce on Shen Jingbin. However, Shen Jingbin immediately jumped away from Lianshui after her initial attack, leaving not even her shadow behind by the time Lianshui had turned back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pure Crane and the others used this as an opportunity to unleash all their skills at Lianshui. Upon receiving damage, copious amounts of blood began to flow out of Lianshui’s eye sockets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was able to completely lock Lianshui down with her hit and run tactics. She would slash Lianshui once before immediately dodging after that. She didn’t hold back on her strikes either, putting her all into every strike and targeting Lianshui’s vitals. Lianshui would always be provoked by Shen Jingbin before being subjected to a lynching by the other party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, the wounds on Lianshui’s body increased. In turn, the blood gushing from her sockets had increased proportionately as well. In the end, Lianshui finally fell to the ground after she was subjected to a powerful strike from Pure Crane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have defeated the Entertainer, Lianshui. Please keep up the effort and eradicate the mutants of Undying City.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party heard the system announcement the moment Lianshui hit the ground. Shen Jingbin kept her longsword, walked over to Lianshui’s corpse, and pulled out the whisk that was lodged in her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lianshui’s body immediately turned to ashes when the horsetail whisk was removed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Black Hawk commented, “Ehh, isn’t this monster going to drop something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Delicate Flower sat down. Through her ragged breaths, she asked, “What about the hidden quest? Did any of you receive a quest notification?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of them shook their heads. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk after getting rid of the trash mobs. Otherwise, we might not be able to leave this place if we don’t,” Cheshire Cat said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Hawk let out a wail, “I feel cheated! I mean, look at this! Not only did we get the living daylights scared out of us, this BOSS didn’t even drop anything despite the tiring battle we went through. On top of that, there wasn’t even a single trace of the hidden quest. How frustrating!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Delicate Flower nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pure Crane chuckled at the two of them, “No need to be so impatient. For all we know, the quest might appear once we take care of these mobs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Hawk’s eyes immediately lit up. “Really?” However, her expression crumbled just as fast when she turned to face the ugly mobs beneath her. “Brother Pure Crane, can I refrain from clearing these mobs? I really can’t conquer this psychological obstacle of mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Delicate Flower patted her on the shoulder. “You have to. If you don’t, the one crying would be you when you’re the only one who didn’t get the hidden quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Hawk mumbled to herself, looking as if she’d been deflated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Cheshire Cat shifted his gaze to Shen Jingbin and gave her a once-over before he said, “Does Little Jing know some moves in real life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin nodded. This wasn’t something that could be hidden; anyone with a discerning eye would be able to notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You practice swordplay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shook her head. “I spent two days learning it from someone else for fun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A figure appeared in Cheshire Cat’s mind. “The person who taught you swordplay must be really good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin recalled that that girl seemed to be the defending champion of some competition and nodded, “She’s pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their conversation took place in front of everyone else, allowing them to overhear everything. Black Hawk was pleasantly surprised by this revelation. Turning to Shen Jingbin, she said, “Wow, I didn’t know that Little Jing was so strong! When there’s time in the future, could you teach me?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cheshire Cat looked at her helplessly. “You just want to learn everything. Last time, you even wanted to learn the piano after seeing Delly play. Are you sure you’re able to learn it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Hawk gave a light snort and ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Pure Crane spoke, “Let’s go clear up these mobs. Regardless of whether there’s a hidden quest or not, we can only return after killing them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Hawk mumbled as she got to her feet, “This doesn’t make any sense. Why are there so many trash mobs here and yet there’s no hidden quest to be found? I don’t want to work for free… Ugh, this is just so frustrating!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Lianshui, the slow and weak mobs were much easier to deal with. The only troublesome thing was that their numbers were a bit too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roughly an hour later, the party finally managed to cleanse the entire city of the trash mobs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pure Crane’s hypothesis was right on the mark. The party finally received their hidden quest the moment they dispatched the final mob.</span></p>
