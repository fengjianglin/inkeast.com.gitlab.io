 <p><b>Chapter 174: Stay Away from Chengning (2</b><b>)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning and company stayed in A City for a short while before deciding to return home. On the day of their departure, the Shen siblings sent them off.</p>
 <p>It might have been her imagination, but Shen Jingbin felt that Jian Cishu’s gaze looked a little too bitter when she stared at her, to the point where it made her feel panicked. It was as if Shen Jingbin had robbed her of her husband. Her bitter gaze grew especially pronounced when she neared Zhao Chengning.</p>
 <p>Feeling annoyed, Shen Jingbin decided to hide behind Shen Jingchen to avoid her line of sight.</p>
 <p>When the time for them to board the plane neared, Shen Jingchen went with Zhao Chengning to check-in their luggage while Jian Cishu went to the toilet, leaving only Zhao Chengan and Shen Jingbin behind in the hall.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin wasn’t the kind of person who would initiate conversation with someone she wasn’t familiar with. As they stared at each other in silence, Zhao Chengan suddenly said, “Miss Shen, can I have a word with you?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s gaze fell on him and she raised an eyebrow for him to continue.</p>
 <p>“What do you think of my little brother?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cast a sidelong glance at his expressionless face, a little unsure of what he was trying to get at.</p>
 <p>“He’s pretty good,” She answered, giving a very ordinary reply.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengan gave her a profound look and continued, “Miss Shen, given your intelligence, I believe that you’re able to see Jian Cishu’s feelings for Zhao Chengning.”</p>
 <p>“Cishu is like a little sister to Chengning and I. We’ve known each other for a long time and our families are quite close to one another…”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cut him off. “Can you get to the point?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengan gaze become inscrutable. “I hope you’ll stay away from Chengning. To my Mother, Jian Cishu is the most suitable partner for him, but it looks like Chengning thinks otherwise and treats you differently. As his brother, I don’t wish to see Chengning falling out with our Mother over a woman, so I’m imploring you to maintain your distance from him.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin quietly looked at him for a long while before her lips tugged into a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that, Zhao Chengan frowned in dissatisfaction. “Miss Shen, what’s the meaning of this?”</p>
 <p>Instead of replying, she asked, “Does Zhao Chengning know about this?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengan’s eyebrows knitted. “I believe that this is a private conversation between the two of us. There’s no need for Chengning to know.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh. Mr Zhao, I think you’re talking to the wrong person. If you really do want to ease the tension between Auntie and Zhao Chengning, you should direct your words to your little brother instead,” Seeing the look of displeasure on Zhao Chengan’s face, an exceedingly charming smile suddenly graced Shen Jingbin’s lips, attracting many glances from passersby. “Forgive my asking, but when have you ever seen me approaching your little brother on my own?”</p>
 <p>The moment she said that another profound smile surfaced on Zhao Chengan’s face. “In that case, does Miss Shen think that Chengning is pestering you?”</p>
 <p>Sensing something off about his smile, Shen Jingbin suddenly became alert. Just as she was about to answer, she heard Zhao Chengning’s voice behind her, “Bro, we’re done checking the luggage in.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin turned to see Zhao Chengning looking at her coldly. Shen Jingchen, who was standing beside him, eyed her with indifference as well.</p>
 <p>She finally understood why Zhao Chengan had looked at her that way just now.</p>
 <p><i>Heh, does he think this is some f*cking melodramatic soap opera? What a cliched trick to pull!</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt as if all of her pent-up rage was about to burst out!</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning strode towards the two of them. As he did, Shen Jingbin caught a small smirk on Zhao Chengan’s lips out of the corner of her eye.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning stood by Shen Jingbin’s side and looked at his brother with a dark expression on his face. “Jian Cishu’s not back yet. You better look for her, we’re boarding the plane soon.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengan stared at him for a little while before he stepped past the two of them and walked off without saying a word.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen rubbed his nose and said, “I'll go look for her too.” Before leaving, he abruptly turned to Shen Jingbin and winked.</p>
 <p><i>Your big brother’s going now. Lil’ sister, fighting! We heard what you guys said just now so you better explain things to him!</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was speechless. What was there to explain? Everything she’d said just now was the truth! Humph!</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning suddenly spoke once Shen Jingchen’s figure disappeared into the crowd. “Didn't you say you don't find me annoying?”</p>
 <p>Did some bitterness magically appear in his voice?</p>
 <p>She turned her to look at him. “I don't find you annoying.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning’s ebony black eyes locked firmly on her. “I heard everything you and my brother said just now.”</p>
 <p>She suddenly felt like patting his head.</p>
 <p>With that thought in mind, her hand unconsciously stretched out. However, due to their difference in height, her hand ended up on his shoulders instead. “Don't overthink what I said.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning held the hand that she’d placed on his shoulder, kneading it discreetly before acting as if he were just pulling it off. “Don't listen to a word my brother says. He’s fried his brains after spending all these years in Africa.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin couldn't help but laugh. “How can you say that about your brother?”</p>
 <p>“He’s the one who's stirring up trouble for me.”</p>
 <p>“Don't worry, I didn’t take a single word he said to heart.”</p>
 <p>His eyes immediately brimmed with mirth, making it appear as if he were an entirely different person from before. Shen Jingbin flashed a smile in return.</p>
 <p>Between the two of them, there was something quietly budding, growing.</p>
 <p>When it was time to board the plane, Shen Jingbin didn't even spare a single glance for Jian Cishu who’d reappeared or Zhao Chengan. Instead, she devoted all her attention to bidding Zhao Chengning farewell.</p>
 <p>As they watched the three of them leave, Shen Jingchen elbowed her and said, “Aye, Jingjing, why do I feel like your road to romance will be filled with twists and turns?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cast a sidelong glance at him. “Question: what do I like the most?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Jingchen scratched his head. “You like to… beat people up?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the daggers she was glaring at him, he immediately corrected himself and said, “You like challenges!”</p>
 <p>“Do you think taking Zhao Chengning down is going to be challenging?”</p>
 <p>“Tch, it's obvious he treats you differently, why don’t you try me instead? Even I’m more of a challenge than him. Although, his treatment of you aside and taking the attitudes of the people around him towards you into consideration, it’s still going to be pretty difficult... Hold on, what are you planning?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin revealed a devilish smile. “After being cooped up in the game for so long, I think it’s time I get some exercise.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen:&nbsp;<i>Oh no, the demon queen has awakened.</i></p>
