 <p><b>Chapter 173: Stay Away from Chengning (1)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning looked at the clothes in his hands. After giving a shake of his head and a chuckle, he turned around and headed towards the bathroom.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Shen Jingbin shook herself free from Shen Jingchen’s grip the moment they stepped out of the room. “Why the rush? You’re acting like someone’s chasing after you.”</p>
 <p>Bah, he wouldn’t have needed to leave so quickly if it wasn’t for the lovey-dovey atmosphere between her and Zhao Chengning! He’d been hiding just outside the room for a long time, and only rushed in when he couldn’t bear the sight of them being so intimate any longer!</p>
 <p>Honestly, it wasn’t easy to choose between the two of them since both Leader and Ah Ning were his brothers. He’d feel like he’d be letting them down if he chose either of them over the other.</p>
 <p>Ahh, why did he have to shoulder a burden that was beyond his years?</p>
 <p>Seeing Shen Jingchen’s continuously shifting expression, Shen Jingbin revealed a look of disdain and patted his shoulder. “Wake up elder brother, you’re drooling.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen hurriedly reached up to wipe his chin before he realized he was tricked.</p>
 <p><i>How could someone as handsome as him drool!</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s disdain grew even more pronounced. Shaking her head, she sighed before she walked around him and made for her room.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen’s expression faintly contorted as he alternated his gaze between her retreating silhouette and the closed door.</p>
 <p>The next day, Shen Jingbin found that Zhao Chengning was already up when she descended the stairs. At the moment, he was standing at the entrance and speaking with a man in a suit.</p>
 <p>Hearing a noise behind him, he turned and flashed a smile when he saw her, before turning back to continue conversing with the man. However, Shen Jingbin’s appearance had likely cut their conversation short as Zhao Chengning sent the man off after exchanging a few more words with him.</p>
 <p>Before leaving, the man even bowed towards her in a very gentlemanly fashion.</p>
 <p>“You’re up.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, who was that?” Shen Jingbin asked, her hands tracing the rails as she slowly descended the stairs.</p>
 <p>“He's a chauffeur from the hotel that my brother sent to pick me up.”</p>
 <p>The hotel Zhao Chengning and co stayed at provided chauffeur services. If they wished for it, the hotel could alternatively rent a car out for the guests themselves to drive. However, doing so would require a deposit.</p>
 <p>Miss Shen, who rarely stayed in hotels, had forgotten about that.</p>
 <p>“Are you going?”</p>
 <p>“Mm, I’ve already troubled you by staying the night.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. It’s not much trouble.”</p>
 <p>When he heard her reply, Zhao Chengning heaved a sigh of relief and smiled at her. “Hearing that takes a load off my chest. I was afraid you’d dislike me for the trouble I caused.”</p>
 <p>“Shen Jingchen causes a lot more trouble than you,” Walking over to him, her gaze swept past him and found that the man in a suit was quietly waiting outside beside a black Audi. “Is he waiting for you? You should leave.”</p>
 <p>The two of them stood so close together that he was able to take a whiff of her fragrance. “I'll be going then.”</p>
 <p>“Call me if you need anything.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning’s eyes curved upwards in happiness. “There are too many people this time around. I'll come looking for you on my own next time.”</p>
 <p>“Sure.”</p>
 <p>After sending Zhao Chengning off, Shen Jingbin turned back and was about to go wake Shen Jingchen up when her phone suddenly rang.</p>
 <p>Answering the call, she heard an unfamiliar male voice on the other end.</p>
 <p>“Hello, is this Miss Shen?”</p>
 <p>“I am. You are?”</p>
 <p>“Hello Miss Shen, I’m from Yiju Game Corporation. We’re calling you today as we’d like to invite you to be our game’s ambassador…”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin bluntly rejected the man before he could even finish. “I’m sorry, I have no interest in becoming an ambassador.”</p>
 <p>At her rejection, the man on the other end of the call became flustered. “Ms Shen, please consider our request before rejecting. You can find out more about our company before making your decision.”</p>
 <p>“My apologies, I don’t think I’m very suitable for this role.”</p>
 <p>“How about this Miss Shen: why don’t I briefly introduce our company to you… Have you heard of the game &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;? It’s our company’s hottest game right now and a new expansion has just been released. To build interest, our company has decided to shoot a promotional video. We chanced upon a picture of you online recently and we feel that your image matches one of the new NPCs in our expansion. Hence, we’d like to invite you to join us for our promotional shoot.”</p>
 <p>Initially, Shen Jingbin hadn’t wanted to listen to his nonsense and had planned on hanging up, but the words &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestial and Demons&gt;&gt; captured her attention.</p>
 <p>“&lt;&lt;Legends of Celestial and Demons&gt;&gt;?” She mumbled to herself.</p>
 <p>The man immediately saw a ray of hope and hastily continued, “Yes, the very same VRMMO that’s all the rage these days. Do you usually play games? If you’re interested, we can provide you with a top quality account as part of the remuneration.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin hesitated for a moment before she replied, “Let me think about it.”</p>
 <p>“Alright. In that case, I won’t take up your time any longer. My name is Xiangpeng, you can contact me at any time once you’ve made your decision.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin grunted in acknowledgement and hung up.</p>
 <p>Tsk tsk tsk, the game company behind &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; wanted her to be its ambassador. She definitely had to show this off to Shen Jingchen.</p>
