 <p><b>Chapter 270: The Black Tortoise’s Inheritance (2)</b></p>
 <p>“Congratulations on defeating the Guardian Beast, God’s Envoy. The Black Tortoise’s tomb has been brought back to the light. Please use the Black Tortoise’s inheritance to save the land from an abyss of suffering.”</p>
 <p>Two notifications appeared after the monster died. They took a glance at the monster that was rapidly disappearing and concluded that they probably weren’t going to get any drops from the kill.</p>
 <p>Not matter though, uncovering the Black Tortoise’s tomb was good enough.</p>
 <p>She'd previously guessed that the Black Tortoise’s tomb was beneath where they stood, and true enough, the ground began to tremble after the notification appeared. The ground around five meters to their right started to churn, looking as though something was about to appear from within it at any moment.</p>
 <p>Mascot bellowed. Not knowing why it was suddenly acting like this, she hurriedly unsummoned it.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast stood beside Shen Jingbin, holding her up to keep her from falling over.</p>
 <p>After a series of tumultuous shaking, a huge stone tablet appeared where the once flat ground was. Quiet And Steadfast motioned for her to investigate with his eyes, and Shen Jingbin responded by slowly making her way over to it and placing her hands on the tablet.</p>
 <p>“You've come, God’s Envoy,” A voice extremely similar, except thicker and deeper, to that of the Black Tortoise’s spiritual awareness that she’d heard before sounded in her head.</p>
 <p>The next moment, the scenery before Shen Jingbin changed. Quiet And Steadfast and his army of pets disappeared from sight, and it appeared as though she’d stepped into a different realm; one that was a mass of pitch black.</p>
 <p>Just that, a spot of light began to slowly amass before her, eventually coalescing into the form of an enormous Black Tortoise. A strong and robust Winged Serpent could be seen mounted on its back.</p>
 <p>“You’re the Black Tortoise?” Shen Jingbin looked over and asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am,” The Black Tortoise paused as though it was reminiscing about its past. “The White Tiger is with you, right? Can I have a look at it?”</p>
 <p>“Alright,” Shen Jingbin replied before summoning Mascot.</p>
 <p>Mascot spun around in circles and continuously howled when it appeared. Fondness flashed across the Black Tortoise’s eyes as it gazed at Mascot who was by its leg. The Winged Serpent slowly stretched its body out towards Mascot and gently touched against Mascot’s forehead, almost as if it was giving Mascot a kiss. Mascot froze for several seconds before realization dawned upon it and it turned its head towards the Black Tortoise, bounding towards it with a roar.</p>
 <p>Upon nearing the Black Tortoise, Mascot reverted to its original form. The Black Tortoise slowly lowered its head and intimately rubbed against Mascot.</p>
 <p>“The White Tiger emits a murderous aura, so it was seen as the God of Slaughter amongst the Four Divine Beasts. The Vermillion Bird and Azure Dragon both represent divinity, so they weren’t all that close to the White Tiger; I'm the only one who was close to it. It was the only one who remained by my side when my death neared. Oh, how I’ve missed it.”</p>
 <p>After a few moments of intimacy, the Black Tortoise returned Mascot to Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>“The fact that you’re able to meet me means you’ve defeated the Lunar Beasts. In that case, handing my inheritance over to you wouldn’t be a waste,” The Winged Serpent suddenly pulled out a white egg from the Tortoise’s belly and handed it over to her. “I have fallen and I’m no longer able to reincarnate. All I can do is hand you my child. The Liches will know how to hatch the egg. Bring it back to the Sect Leader of the Lich Palace and pass down my heritance to it once it’s grown up.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin took the egg. “I understand.”</p>
 <p>The Black Tortoise continued, “The fate of the world is in disarray. Whether it can be saved will depend on all of you. Go forth, youth, the future is in your hands.”</p>
 <p>After saying its piece, a beam of light shone from the Black Tortoise’s forehead before tunneling into Shen Jingbin’s own.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt warmth suffuse her entire body as countless images flowed into her mind.</p>
 <p>A notification followed immediately after. “Congratulations on receiving the Black Tortoise’s inheritance.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin found herself back to where she previously was when she’d opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>The moment he spotted her, Quiet And Steadfast walked straight up to her and asked, “How’d it go?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin pulled out the tortoise egg&nbsp;<i>(Eh, it should be a tortoise egg, not a snake egg, right?)</i>&nbsp;for him to see. “I received the Black Tortoise’s egg and its inheritance.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast took the egg and weighed it in his hands. “How do you plan on hatching this thing?”</p>
 <p>“The Black Tortoise said to look for your Sect Leader.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast returned the egg to her. “Alright, let’s look for Poison Toad tomorrow. Rest up after you log out; you must be tired after working the whole day.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded, and the pair returned to the teleportation array and teleported back. They then took the ferry back home after returning to shore and logged off.</p>
 <p>The next day, Shen Jingbin was awoken by the sound of her phone ringing. Her first thought was that it must’ve been a call from her elders, but found that it was actually Xiangpeng who was calling after she stared at the screen.</p>
 <p>“Hello, Ms Shen, I'm Xiangpeng from Yiju. Do you still remember me?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin had just woken up. Her head was still a little fuzzy so she just hummed a reply. Xiangpeng then said, “We’ve finished producing the promotional trailer you previously shot for &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;. Please drop by our office and have a look at it when you have the time. If you’re satisfied with it, we’ll release the trailer.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin grabbed the calendar beside her bed. It didn’t look like she had anything on today. “I’ll drop by today then.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, give me a call again when you reach our office. We’ll send someone down to show you in.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.”</p>
 <p>“We’ll do that then; bye.”</p>
 <p>“Mhmm, bye.”</p>
 <p>Her lethargy now gone, Shen Jingbin got out of bed and went to wash up. The doorbell rang just as she’d finished. She jogged over to the door and opened it, only to see her Mother standing by the entrance.</p>
 <p>“You're up early today.”</p>
 <p>Realising that it was her Mother, Shen Jingbin went back into the house. Mama Shen walked in with her hands behind her backPapa Shen trailed behind her.</p>
 <p>Mama Shen look around. When she noticed Shen Jingbin was the only one around, she asked, “Where's Shen Jingchen?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin went over to the fridge and poured herself a cup of milk. After taking a sip, she said, “He’s not up yet, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Go wake him up, we’ll be heading out to buy something before going over to uncle Zhao’s place for lunch.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave an “oh” of acknowledgement before she placed her cup down and obediently run off to wake Shen Jingchen up.</p>
