 <p><strong>Chapter 68: What Kind Of Things Are You Into? (2)&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning wore a short-sleeved shirt coupled with a jacket on top of it. He matched his attire with a pair of khaki coloured casual pants. Without his jacket on, Zhao Chengning suddenly looked several years younger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin thought to herself, </span><i><span style>“Was it something I said?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ones playing on the basketball court had long since noticed Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin’s presence on the bleachers. Ahhhh no, they had long since noticed Shen Jingbin. After all, she was unbelievably beautiful, you’d have to be blind not to notice her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They stopped what they were doing, watching as the man started walking over to them after saying something to the girl. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was obviously trying to show off in front of the girl! Brothers, we can’t let him do as he pleases!</span></i></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning spread his hands in front of them and said, “Let’s have a match.”</p>
 <p>The man holding the basketball eyed him up. “Sure.”</p>
 <p>There were originally five men on the basketball court. They numbered six now with the inclusion of Zhao Chengning. Splitting themselves into groups of three, they decided to play a half-court match.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin only realised how modest Zhao Chengning was being when he said he know how to play “a little” after the match started. How was that “a little”?! She seriously suspected that he was on a basketball team in the past!</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning was a fair bit taller than the other players. This, coupled with his outstanding personality, meant that his shots and passes were exceptionally elegant. It didn’t take long before a crowd of spectators had formed at the basketball court they were at.</p>
 <p>“Hello beau...beaut...beautiful girl, is the person playing basketball on the court your friend?” A round faced girl carefully approached Shen Jingbin and asked. She then sat down beside her and continued to enquire, “Which department are you guys from? Why haven’t I seen you guys before?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin glanced at her, causing the girl’s face to suddenly redden.</p>
 <p><i>What the f*ck! She’s too beautiful!</i></p>
 <p>“We’re not students from B University.”</p>
 <p>The round faced girl stammered out another question, “The-then... could you tell me which school you guys are from?”</p>
 <p>Probably because she found the girl’s flushed face cute, Shen Jingbin turned to her and smiled. “I’m from A University.”</p>
 <p>A roar broke out in her mind, and the girl’s face instantly turned as red as a tomato. She abruptly stood up, her body swaying as she did, and issued a squeal before she covered her face and sprinted off towards her close friend.</p>
 <p><i>The beauty smiled! The beauty smiled! The beauty smiled! Ahhhh, how can such a gorgeous looking person exist! </i></p>
 <p>Even she as a girl was feeling embarrassed!</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin found the round faced girl’s swaying silhouette as she ran away particularly amusing. She’d definitely ask her for her name if she ever ran into her again.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a cry of surprise could be heard from the surrounding crowd.</p>
 <p>Shifting her gaze back to the basketball court, she found that the cause of it was Zhao Chengning landing a three pointer.</p>
 <p>Due to the physical exertion, a thin layer of sweat had formed on his face. After landing his shot, Zhao Chengning stopped and wiped the sweat off his brows. The sight of him doing so was incredibly alluring, to the point where Shen Jingbin heard several girls beside her taking in deep breaths.</p>
 <p>He then glanced in her direction and flashed her a cheshire smile.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning had already been born with excellent looks. That, coupled with the expression that he now wore, was so stimulating that she could almost hear the thumping of her own heart.</p>
 <p>This was why handsome guys picking up girls was such a terrifying thing.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin saw Zhao Chengning saying something to the group of guys, before he then jogged back to where she was.</p>
 <p>Grabbing his jacket and standing up, Shen Jingbin asked, “Not playing anymore?”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning took his jacket from her and wore a smile filled with profound meaning as he replied, “I’m too old, I can’t compare to the vigor of those young’uns.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin: ...</p>
 <p>“The two of you please wait! Here’s a drink for you!” The round faced girl that ran off from before managed to pull out two bottles of Pulse[1. A brand of sports drink. Here’s how it looks like: <a href="http://danonewaters.com.cn/static/images/images/cpmd_1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://danonewaters.com.cn/static/images/images/cpmd_1.png</a>] from somewhere and came running back with them before shoving them into their hands.</p>
 <p>Both of them were stunned into silence. Zhao Chengning was the first to react, he turned to the girl and nodded. “Thanks.”</p>
 <p>After giving his thanks, he twisted open the bottle and drank a mouthful. The remaining sweat on his chin slid down his neck and made its way over his undulating adam’s apple, before it came into contact with his collar and extinguished itself.</p>
 <p><i>“Gulp”</i>, Shen Jingbin thought she heard the sound of saliva being swallowed. She swiftly turned her head to the side and looked at the girl. “Little sis, your name is…”</p>
 <p>Before she even had the chance to finish, the girl’s entire body trembled and she spoke, “What’s that? Mm... feel free to come back to B City more often! I’ll take my leave first! We’ll meet again one day if we’re fated!” With that, the girl sprinted away once more.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she saw the round faced girl’s silhouette disappear like a wisp of smoke. She felt incomparably depressed as she thought in her heart, <i>“Don’t run away so quickly lil sis! I still haven’t asked you for your name!”</i></p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning brought his drink down and cocked his head to the side in bewilderment as he asked, “Am I really that terrifying? Why’d she run away so quickly?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin fished out a packet of tissue from her bag. She opened it up and handed him a piece, before she pondered for a moment and replied, “It’s probably because you’re too handsome, and it just so happens that she has a thing for guys like you, so she was feeling embarrassed.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning took the tissue from her and wiped the sweat from his face and neck. He then looked at her, his expression unfathomable as he said, “Then what about you? Are you into guys like me?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin: ...</p>
