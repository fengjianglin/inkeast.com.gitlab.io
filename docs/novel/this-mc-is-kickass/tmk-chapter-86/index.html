 <p><b>Chapter 86: Illusory Spirit Realm (2)</b></p>
 <p><span style>The old man arrived before the two of them, his eyes emitting a green light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me introduce myself; my NPC’s name is Mu Ge. In truth, I play the role of NPC 002. You can call me 002. 001 is the child you met outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>002’s gaze fell on Shen Jingbin's face and lingered for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? You must be the player whom the system deemed the most beautiful when starting the game? I never thought you’d Uglify yourself to the limit yet still end up looking presentable… Oh, that's right, let me explain. Our upper limit is 99%, there's no 100%.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then swept his gaze over Quiet And Steadfast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I say, bro, you guys are married, right? That’s a stupid question. Poison Toad wouldn’t have sent you here if you weren't married… Heheheh, brother, let me tell you, you’ve got a great deal of luck. You've married a true beauty… Eh, even though she doesn't look like one right now, I guarantee that the system's insight is absolutely reliable!”</span></p>
 <p>“Anyhow, you sure are lucky, beauty. I heard that the legendary White Tiger that Development Team A secretly released for testing was accidently tamed by you? Hahaha, you’re killing me! That White Tiger was meant to be an existence that transcended the current World BOSSes, but it's currently still in its testing phase. It's taming method hasn’t even been set yet. There’s only a provisional condition of not using skills to attack it. Who would've thought you’d be able to pick it up so cheaply. To think that it was caught so easily by someone solo playing... I’d be crying if I were the Leader of the Development Team! Hahahahaha.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, right. Handsome, you received an epic quest, right? Sigh, I really sympathise with you. This epic quest was something that the PMS-ing women of Development Team B came up with. It's both long and complex, you're being played!”</p>
 <p>Without giving Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast any chance to respond, 002 started prattling on and on the moment he approached.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin: …</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast: …</p>
 <p>They wagered that this 002 must be a chatterbox!</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast sighed, interrupting 002 before he could continue on. “Um, could you tell us what we should be doing now?”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Oh! Sure, sure!” Only now did 002 seem to remember that he still had a task to complete, fishing out two pieces of paper and pens from who-knows-where.</p>
 <p>“I was supposed to cause you guys more trouble, but I’ll skip that part since I’m such a nice and kind-hearted person. Look, there's two answer sheets here; one for each of you. Their contents are different, so make sure you get the right one. Since you guys listened to me blather on for so long, you can answer however you like and I'll still give you guys a pass.”</p>
 <p>Taking the answer sheets and pens from 002's hand, the two roughly skimmed over the contents of their answer sheets, their faces turning dark in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“Question: If someone were to offer you a top quality set of equipment in exchange for your husband, would you agree?"</p>
 <p>“Question: Would you agree to renounce your wife for ten beautiful women?”</p>
 <p>“Question: Your best friend and your wife have fallen into a BOSS’s attack range, who will you save first?”</p>
 <p>“Question: Your best friend said she doesn’t like your husband and wants you to divorce him. After which, she would find you an even better man. What will you do?”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin really felt like tossing her pen away and beating someone up! What kind of questions were these?!</p>
 <p>She glanced at Quiet And Steadfast beside her and discovered that he had already taken up his pen and was writing something with poise.</p>
 <p><i>Hey, big bro, please tell me; how do you face all these questions with a straight face?</i></p>
 <p>It might have been because he saw that her pen had yet to move, but 002 moved closer and peeked at her answer sheet before he asked, “Why aren't you writing, pretty girl?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin curled her hand into a fist. “I… can't write.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Is that so? Then I'll help you write, and you can give me your contact details at the same time! For example, your Weibo or your WeChat will do.”</p>
 <p>“… Nevermind, I'd better write it myself instead of troubling you. Thank you.”</p>
 <p>With great difficulty, Shen Jingbin managed to pick up her pen and start answering, imitating Quiet And Steadfast's manner of writing. 002 rested his chin in his hands and leaned to the side, beaming while watching her and looking as if he was admiring a work of art.</p>
 <p><i>Did this dude go crazy from overworking?! Why the hell was he staring at her so attentively?! Doesn’t he know he’s being an eyesore?! </i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt a great deal of pressure from being the focus of his gaze.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I've finished filling it out.”</p>
 <p>Just when she could no longer withstand the pressure of 002's gaze, Quiet And Steadfast saved her in a timely manner.</p>
 <p>“Woah, so fast?” 002 was a little astonished at Quiet And Steadfast's speed.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast didn't speak, instead handing the answer sheet straight over to him. 002 took the questionnaire and glanced through it before nodding. “Good, good. Handsome, you pass.”</p>
 <p>He then propped up his chin on his hand and continued beaming at Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>“Pretty girl, you don't need to rush. Just take your time.”</p>
 <p>“… You're not going to examine it carefully?” The corners of Shen Jingbin's mouth twitched as she asked.</p>
 <p>“Examine what? 001 is just mucking around. There’s no point in examining it, you can answer it however you like.”</p>
 <p>Outside the cabin, 001 sneezed yet again.</p>
 <p><i>Tsk tsk tsk, could I be catching a cold? After I send off those two players and get off work, I'll go home and take some cold medicine.</i></p>
 <p>In the end, Shen Jingbin eventually finished answering all of the questionnaire’s outlandish questions under 002's strange and ardent gaze. She then handed it, and her pen, back to 002.</p>
 <p>002 didn’t even bother to skim through her answers this time around. He held her questionnaire and sighed as he looked at her handwriting. “My, my. Pretty girl, your words are so beautiful. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen someone write as beautifully as you!”</p>
 <p>“…So did I pass or not?!”</p>
 <p>“You pass, you pass! You definitely passed! Come, come. Put out your arms and I'll mark you guys with a seal. With this, once 001 sends you back, Poison Toad will know the forbidden art has succeeded and he’ll tell you guys all about the Black Tortoise.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast obediently raised their sleeves to expose their arms. 002 retrieved a seal from within his robes and stamped down on their arms, causing an imprint of a snake biting its own tail to appear on their skin.</p>
