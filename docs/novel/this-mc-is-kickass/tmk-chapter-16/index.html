 <p><strong>Chapter 16: The Demonic Sect’s Map&nbsp;</strong><span style>The three of them ran into a fatty the moment they walked into the Landlord’s residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! Who are these people that have the gall to barge into my demesne! Guards, seize them!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty was around 1.6 meters tall. He was pudgy and had a layer of oil covering his entire face. This person was likely Landlord Yang. The fatty’s complexion instantly paled when he saw them break in. He clutched his throat and howled for help while turning to make a break for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tch, how boring.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast probably found Landlord Yang’s screeching too grating for his ears. Without waiting for the Shen siblings to act, he nimbly sent a concealed weapon flying over to Landlord Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment, they heard a cackling sound akin to the cries a wild duck made when someone clutched its neck. Landlord Yang’s previous howls now caught in his throat. His enormous body looked as if it had lost its support, landing on the ground with a loud “bang”</span><i><span style>.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen stood dumbstruck at the side, only reacting after several seconds had passed. Overcome with grief, he lamented, “Oh my god. I’ll say this, this fellow has never done these kinds of quests before. He’s basically screwing around! Screwing around I tell you! Bringing this guy along to go questing will be your biggest mistake! Did you know?! This fat bastard over there is the Landlord Yang that you’re supposed to find. With him dead, how are you supposed to find out what happened to Wu Lang’s sister!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shot him a disdainful look and interrupted him, “Haven’t you done this quest before? In that case, wouldn’t everything work out if you just brought me over to the cellar’s entrance to find his sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s voice immediately died down. Looking a little wronged, he said, “The cellar was found by Wu Lang. I just followed the quest’s progression and was teleported into the cellar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doesn’t that mean he didn’t know where the cellar’s entrance was either?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin released a sigh and ignored him. She took several steps forward and crouched beside Landlord Yang’s corpse. After sizing him up for a moment, she rolled up her sleeves and started look over his corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen, who was still immersed in the grief of “Landlord Yang’s death”, immediately exclaimed when he saw what she was doing, “The guy’s already dead and you’re still trying to rummage his corpse. Isn’t there a saying that we should respect the dead? Can’t you just let him rest in peace… F*ck. Actually, I’ve wanted to talk about your preferences! Look at you, you’re not even willing to let the corpse of a fatty go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin replied without raising her head, “Have those hundreds of episodes of Sherlock Holmes you’ve watched gone to waste? Corpses normally have some clues on them. Are you telling me you don’t even have such a basic level of general knowledge?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen immediately put on a proper look and said, “I was just kidding, I obviously know about such methods! I’ll have a look around somewhere else to see if there’s any other clues.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, he dragged Quiet And Steadfast along with him and ran off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Landlord Yang’s residence was a majestic sight to behold, but the two of them disappeared from Shen Jingbin’s field of vision in the blink of an eye. However, she wasn’t worried about them in the least since they were experts. In any case, it was more likely for her to come across a mishap than them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she once again focused all of her attention on Landlord Yang’s corpse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know whether Landlord Yang was trying to embody the phrase “as rich as a country”, but to her surprise, he wore three sets of inner and outer clothing even though the weather clearly wasn’t all that cold. Each and every piece of apparel he wore was incomparably smooth, costing extraordinary amounts of money in the form of silk and satin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from his clothes, Shen Jingbin occasionally found several pieces of gold and silver from the hem of his robes and other unknown areas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system’s notifications constantly rang out beside her ears. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a banknote worth 20 taels.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a piece of <em>Hetian</em> jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained two gold leaves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a jade pearl hairpin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was even nonsense like a jade pearl hairpin, was this fatty planning to look for his lover?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tch tch tch, being rich really was the best.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin found an increasingly large number of items as her search continued. Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but lament as she looked at the things she had on hand now, “Capitalism is the root of all evil.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got to Landlord Yang’s undershirt, Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but break out in a cold shiver as she made contact with his slightly greasy skin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bleh, disgusting!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, her fingertips seemed to brush against something just as she was about to pull out her hand. Enduring the discomfort she felt from her hair that stood on end, Shen Jingbin clenched her teeth and groped about, pulling it out once she got ahold of the item in question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It turned out to be a piece of parchment that was folded into four layers. This ancient and brown piece of parchment was still suffused with the warmth from Landlord Yang’s body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It appeared to be a map?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin eyed it for a bit before opening it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A “ding” from the system could be heard the moment she completely unfurled the map. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a map to the Demonic Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have triggered the hidden quest ‘The Mysterious Demonic Sect’, Will you accept this quest? Yes/No. (Trigger condition: Find the Demonic Sect’s map after killing Landlord Yang. Hint: Only players with a Luck attribute of 20 or higher will be able to obtain the Demonic Sect’s map.)” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quest: ‘The Mysterious Demonic Sect’ — Annihilate the protector of the Demonic Sect, ‘Du the Unvanquished’ (0/1).”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked at the parchment in her hands and silently faced the heavens. Another hidden quest? Could her personality be a little </span><i><span style>too </span></i><span style>good?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That aside, did the development team really have such sick hobbies? She had to sift through layers upon layers of clothing till she finally found the map on the very last one. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a setting was way too perverted!</span></i></p>
