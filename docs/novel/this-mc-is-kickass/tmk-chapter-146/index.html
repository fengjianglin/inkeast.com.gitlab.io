 <p><b>Chapter 146: Aunt Zhang Returns Home (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang’s home was located in a rather wealthy town due to its relatively close distance from the city. As they were bringing Aunt Zhang’s luggage along, Shen Jingchen opted to use a more low-profile and practical vehicle to avoid attracting the attention of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later in the day, their car stopped in front of a cottage at the very end of the village’s market. Shen Jingchen stepped out of the car to help Aunt Zhang with her luggage, while Shen Jingbin remained in the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang’s husband, Qu Fugui, was alerted by the activity outside his home and he came running out, a hint of surprise colouring his face when he saw his wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why’re you back again? Didn’t Xinxin say she was going to live with you in the city? What’s all this now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang bade Shen Jingchen to be careful while she replied to her husband, “Xinxin’s in her last year of high school, so I’ve asked my employers for a vacation since I’m worried that you won’t be able to handle it.”</span><i></i><i> </i></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Shen Jingchen just happened to pop out from the back. He straightened himself and greeted Qu Fugui, “Hello Uncle Qu.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite his wife being the siblings’ nanny all these years, Qu Fugui himself had never once seen who her charges were. With the sudden appearance of a young man who was outstanding in both looks and temperament, Qu Fugui responded slowly, “H-hello, you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Us siblings are the ones whom Aunt Zhang has been taking care of all this while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Siblings?” Qu Fugui looked around. </span><i><span style>But there’s only one of you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin rolled down the car window and greeted him, “Hello, Uncle Qu.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are all people from the city so good-looking?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Fugui looked at Shen Jingbin and his mind blanked out for a few moments. When he came to, he blushed at the realization that he’d actually fallen into a daze because of this young lass. Awkwardly coughing, he said, “Eh, hello-hello there… Um, do you the two of you want to come in for a bit? I’ll prepare some tea for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen moved Aunt Zhang’s luggage into the house and replied, “No need, we’re just here to send Aunt Zhang back and will be leaving soon after. No need to trouble yourself, Uncle Qu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Fugui obediently nodded in response and dumbly stood to the side. He watched on as Shen Jingchen carried Aunt Zhang’s luggage into their home before he politely bade farewell to the couple and left. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you still looking at?” Aunt Zhang noticed her husband staring in a daze at the direction the siblings had driven off in and patted his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragged back to reality by his wife, Qu Fugui turned back and stared at his wife for a few seconds, before he asked, “Are all city people so good-looking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang looked at him from the corner of her eyes and said replied with a look of amusement on her face, “Look at you, it’s not as if you’ve never been to the city before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I used to think our Xinxin had become prettier, but after comparing her to those two, she seems...” Qu Fugui chose not to continue. After all, Qu Yanxin was his daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the mention of their daughter, Aunt Zhang’s smile faded slightly. “She good-looking by our town’s standards. However, there are plenty of girls that are prettier than her in the city. You shouldn’t praise her so much from now on, otherwise, she won’t be able to change once she grows a big head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said her piece, Aunt Zhang turned and walked into her home. Qu Fugui looked at his wife’s back and scratched his head, unable to comprehend what she meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the siblings that had arrived just now were really good-looking, more so than any celebrity he’d ever seen on television. The younger sister, in particular, was the pinnacle of refinement!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xinxin will definitely be just as refined in the future when she enters a university in the city.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin’s eyes widened at the sight of her Mother busying herself in the kitchen when she returned home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom! Why are you here?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin thought her Mother was just threatening her; she didn’t think that she was actually being serious!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing her daughter’s voice, Aunt Zhang turned to look at her and replied, “This is my house, why wouldn’t I be here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, what I mean to say is: you’re over here, so what’ll happen to Big Brother Shen? What about your job?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xinxin, you’re back,” Just then, Qu Fugui walked through the entrance with vegetables in hand. At the sight of his daughter, he happily said, “Your Mother took a vacation just so she could look after you, aren’t you glad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to be happy about? What's she going to do about her job if she comes back? She says it’s a vacation, but how can she be so sure they’d be willing to take her back in again when she goes back!” Near the end of her speech, Qu Yanxin’s tone of voice sounded a little shrill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’d never be able to get close to Shen Jingchen again if her Mother wasn’t under their employ!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Fugui looked at his emotional daughter in confusion and replied, “That’s not right, the siblings your Mother takes care of drove her back today. They seemed like reasonable people to me. Oh, that’s right, that younger sister sure was pretty and refined. Xinxin, you should know who I’m talking about, right? You should learn a thing or two from her...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” Her Father’s words stabbed into her heart like barbed thorns. Unable to take it anymore, Qu Yanxin screamed as she ran into her room and slammed the door shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Fugui looked at the door to his daughter’s room in confusion and asked his wife, “What’s the matter with her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang gave a profound glance at Qu Yanxin’s door before she replied, “It’s nothing. She might’ve been too happy about me coming back. Hurry up and help me wash the vegetables!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Came Qu Fugui’s obedient reply as he squeezed into the kitchen with vegetables in hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is that what my daughter’s like she’s happy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since Aunt Zhang had gone home, the Shen siblings decided to hang around outside and play before returning to the Shen residence for dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Granny Shen was overjoyed about the siblings’ unannounced return. Old Master Shen, however, was anything but happy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could anyone be happy when there were two brats vying for his partner’s attention?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Granny Shen saw through her husband’s dissatisfaction. Pulling him aside, she asked, “Can you stop acting like this? It’s rare for the kids to come home on their own… You should ask Little Jing about her relationship with the boy from Ole Zhao’s family later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Master Shen’s eyes shone brightly upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh? Looks like he’s found something interesting to entertain himself with!</span></i></p>
