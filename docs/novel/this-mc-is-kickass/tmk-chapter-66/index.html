 <p><strong>Chapter 66: A Farce (2)&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning knew he couldn’t be too hasty, so he restrained himself a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He decided to stop teasing Shen Jingbin and joined in on the other group’s drinking games.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked at the glass beneath her and absentmindedly observed the people on the first floor. As she did, she suddenly noticed someone who looked familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood up and look over again, but the person was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin so shook up by this turn of events that she didn’t even notice that the four other men were suddenly looking in her direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?” Zhao Chengning asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s gotten you so flustered, Little Jingjing?” Shen Jingchen asked as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shook her head and said, “It’s nothing. It must’ve been my imagination… What game are you guys playing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She very cleverly tried to divert their attention and change the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, Shen Jingchen was the first to fall for her act. He immediately pulled her over and started explaining the game that they were playing to her.</span></p>
 <p>Intelligent people learned everything quickly. After listening to a part of the explanation, Shen Jingbin indicated she’d understood the rules and decisively entered the fray.</p>
 <p>Her participation caused the passions’ of Xuya and the man with the mutton chop sideburns to burn especially hot.</p>
 <p>While the group was enjoying their game, their curtain was suddenly pulled apart and they heard a pleasantly surprised voice. ”Excuse me everyone. Sorry to bother you, but if you’re interested, please have a look at our... Second Young Master!”</p>
 <p>They looked in the direction of the voice and found that it belonged to a young girl wearing a miniskirt and a blouse that revealed her navel. She stood at the entrance of their cubby hole, astonishment colouring her face as she looked at them.</p>
 <p><i>So, it really wasn’t her imagination running wild.</i></p>
 <p>Closer inspection of the girl’s appearance confirmed that it wasn’t Shen Jingbin’s eyes playing tricks on her.</p>
 <p>She was the young girl from Blooming Flower Pavilion who led them to their table.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning looked at the girl who suddenly appeared. The ambition in her eyes was something that he was all too familiar with. A wave of disgust rose from within him as he said, “Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Beiyu coyly tugged at the back of her miniskirt and covered it before saying, “I...I...I work here part-time. I didn’t expect to see Second Young Master here as well…”</p>
 <p>All of the men in their group had extensive experience with these things. Even if Shen Jingchen was dense, such events were commonplace for him as well, so all of them instantly understood what was going on.</p>
 <p>The man with mutton chop sideburns set down his bottle of alcohol and leaned into the sofa. The atmosphere about him turning cold as he asked, “Little girl, are you old enough to work here?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Beiyu took a step forward and walked into the room. “I’m old enough. I’m already twenty years old!”</p>
 <p>Having her age called into question seemed to have caused her to panic as her charming face was flushed red, making her look especially cute.</p>
 <p>Xuya sneered. “Oh? So you’re the same age as me. Would you like to have a drink with me, pretty miss?” As he said that, he lifted up a glass of alcohol and walked towards her.</p>
 <p>Zhang Beiyu wore a look of horror as she immediately reeled back towards Zhao Chengning.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen, who at some point had moved over to Shen Jingbin’s side, used his leg to nudge against her own, hinting at her to make some space and move over. He then plopped down beside her and wore an amused look on his face. He turned to Shen Jingbin and said, “Tut, tut, tut, she’s throwing herself into his arms.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin rolled her eyes at him but didn’t say anything. The only thing she cared about right now was seeing what this girl who appeared out of the blue would do next.</p>
 <p>She’d always been curious about these things.</p>
 <p>Even though their parents’ intimacy was the stuff of legends, there were still some self-assured women who, flying the flag of true love, attempted to snatch away the queen of the household’s man. Although the outcome was always a given, Shen Jingbin had developed an intense interest in these women.</p>
 <p>What exactly made them think that their love was “one true love”?</p>
 <p>How did this bizarre train of thought come about?</p>
 <p>Zhang Beiyu stopped in her tracks when she was just two steps away from Zhao Chengning. She found herself unable to move an inch from where she stood.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning eyed her coldly as he sat on the sofa. His chilling gaze sending an uncontrollable shiver down her spine. That look of his made her feel as if all her thoughts were laid bare to him.</p>
 <p>“Second…Second Young Master…” Zhang Beiyu stammered. This was completely different from what she’d expected!</p>
 <p>After glaring at her for a few more seconds, Zhao Chengning slowly said, “Get out.”</p>
 <p>Unwilling to leave just like that, she clenched the sides of her skirt and sputtered out, “Second Young Master...I…”</p>
 <p>The man with the mutton chop sideburns didn’t seem to have Zhao Chengning’s level of patience. He stood, walked over to the curtains, and said to the waiter outside, “Call the Manager over.”</p>
 <p>As it was an order from their Boss, the waiter who happened to pass by practically flew downstairs to retrieve the Manager.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong Brother Luo?” The Manager of the bar was a comical fatty. Upon hearing that his Boss was looking for him, he immediately came running over, his broad forehead coated in sweat.</p>
 <p>The man with the mutton chop sideburns pointed at Zhang Beiyu, who was standing in the midst of them with a look of bewilderment on her face and said, “When did this girl start working here? Do you really have the gall to use someone as brainless as her?!”</p>
 <p>The Manager raised his head and glanced at the girl, before he turned to look at Zhao Chengning who was sitting on the sofa with an icy look on his face. He immediately understood what was going on and his forehead was once again covered in sweat. “She’s new, Brother Luo. She said that she wanted to moonlight here by selling alcohol. Since she looked quite pretty and we haven’t been seeing much customers lately, I thought of asking her to try out for a bit… I never expected her to cause a commotion for you and Second Young Master.”</p>
 <p>“Haven’t I told you before who we should and shouldn’t be taking in here?”</p>
 <p>“You...you have.”</p>
 <p>“Your wage for this month will be halved. Go back and think about where you’ve gone wrong.”</p>
 <p>“Al-alright, Brother Luo.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t just stand there, get her out of here!” The man with mutton chop sideburns roared.</p>
 <p>All of the fat on the Manager’s body trembled as he hurriedly walked in, and grabbing Zhang Beiyu with his hand, her dragged her out of the room.</p>
 <p>Ever since the man with mutton chop sideburns told the waiter to look for the Manager, Zhang Beiyu had been standing there in a daze. She knew she’d made a grave miscalculation today.</p>
 <p>However, it was too late for regrets.</p>
 <p>In the end, she turned back and looked at the woman beside Zhao Chengning.</p>
 <p>She just continued to leisurely sit on the couch, her eyes tranquil as she indifferently looked back at Zhang Beiyu.</p>
 <p>It was as if she was watching a farce.</p>
