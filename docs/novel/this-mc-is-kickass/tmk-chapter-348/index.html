 <p><b>Chapter 348: Comparing Yourself To Others Will Only Lead To Frustration (2)</b></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin stood by the Cherry Blossom Man’s side. There were some players who were so afraid of the Boss, they didn’t even dare to go near it to pick up the boxes. As a result, this one little box was snatched up by her.</p>
 <p>The Lucky Gift Boxes would only be active for 15 minutes. Any unclaimed boxes after this would be despawned by the system. But, there was no need to worry about that happening. The speed at which the players moved was nothing to scoff at.</p>
 <p>At the end of it, Shen Jingbin had managed to get her hands on 8 boxes. During this time, Quiet And Steadfast hadn’t bent over a single time to pick up a box. Instead, he chose to stand vigil beside Shen Jingbin, giving off the impression that he wasn’t the least bit interested in the boxes.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you grab a few for yourself?” Shen Jingbin asked.</p>
 <p>“I was feeling lazy, and I don’t have much faith in my luck,” Quiet And Steadfast said with a shrug.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s lips curled. She fished out the mount she’d previously gotten and said, “Since you don’t have any faith in your own luck, then you should trust in mine instead. Here, this is for you. Think of it as repayment for your New Year’s gift.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s eyes widened after receiving the item from her. “A Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry? That’s a huge sum of money, beautiful. Are you trying to keep me as your mistress?”</p>
 <p>“Mhmm. Is that enough? If it isn’t, can I pay by installment instead?”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast chuckled and tried to return it to Shen Jingbin. When she refused to accept it, he said, “You’re better off keeping it. I appreciate the gesture, and it’s a great mount, but it doesn’t suit me. Besides, I have lots of mounts already, so I have no need for it.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin remained resolute. “No, this was meant for you. I’ll toss it if you don’t want it.”</p>
 <p>The moment she said that a number of people crowded around her. On closer inspection, they all turned out to be members of Jade Sea Pavilion.</p>
 <p>I’m Not A Monster scratched his head. “Leader, Nutty, hurry up and get rid of it. We can pick it up if you toss it! The two of you are brimming with heroism, so you should keep to what you said and toss out something as insignificant as the Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry. Spare a thought for how losers like us feel.”</p>
 <p>The rest of the people surrounding them nodded in unison before fixing their gaze onto the gift box in Quiet And Steadfast’s hands.</p>
 <p>Left with no other choice, Quiet And Steadfast could only accept it. If he didn’t, Shen Jingbin might have really gotten rid of it.</p>
 <p>Satisfied with the outcome, Shen Jingbin said, “All I need is the Great Sage. I’m afraid Mascot might feel jealous if I got a few more mounts.”</p>
 <p><i>Mascot: Hey, don’t turn me into a scapegoat!</i></p>
 <p>Feeling somewhat disappointed that the Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry had ended up in the hands of their Leader, everyone shook their heads.</p>
 <p><i>Sigh, why couldn’t you have been a little more stubborn, Leader? Give us a chance!</i></p>
 <p>In an attempt to console their broken hearts, the members of Jade Sea Pavilion decided to open a few Lucky Gift Boxes.</p>
 <p>After fighting for the Lucky Gift Boxes, many of the players weren’t in a hurry to leave, so they sat down and began opening their boxes as well. They firmly believed that the area the Lucky Gift Boxes dropped in would bring them good luck.</p>
 <p>But alas, it was not to be. The unlucky ones would still remain unlucky regardless of the location they were at. Take for instance Next Week Is Unlikely; he’d managed to get over 50 boxes, but all that got him was some health and mana potions along with several small experience pills.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin decided to join in on the fun and opened up a gift box. The moment she opened the box, she was enveloped in a ray of golden light.</p>
 <p>[System Announcement] Player Nutjob has opened an Exquisite Lucky Gift Box. A ray of golden light rises to the heavens, and a gale wind blows. Suddenly, all is calm once again. Within the box lies a ‘Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry Gift Box’. Such luck is truly second to none.</p>
 <p>F*ck!</p>
 <p>What the f*ck!</p>
 <p>F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!</p>
 <p>The players near Shen Jingbin were nearly blinded by the golden light. But, when the system announcement appeared, they almost had a mind to stab out their own eyes.</p>
 <p>If memory served them right, this was the second Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry Gift Box this woman had obtained today! F*ck, what kind of luck did she have? GMs, are you sure this woman isn’t your relative or something?!</p>
 <p>Next Week Is Unlikely scowled miserably at his bro’s wife. It felt as if his heart was crumbling to pieces. “Hey, Nutty… I mean, Big Sis! Can I have a chat with you? If you happen to get another Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry, could you lower your price a little and sell it to me?!”</p>
 <p>“Nutty, I’ll hand over all of my boxes to you in the future. Just think of it as you helping me to open them. How’s about it?”</p>
 <p>“Sob sob sob. I wanna go for a sex change so that I can marry Nutty. She’s a walking hack! Leader, I’m going to fight you for her!”</p>
 <p>Everyone else started to kick up a fuss.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast could only stare helplessly at his wife, while the latter also stared helplessly back at him.</p>
 <p>In the end, Shen Jingbin didn’t manage to get another Ninth Heaven Phoenix Cry, but she did get a pretty good mount which she gave to Next Week Is Unlikely. The Cherry Blossom Man was also defeated, and they even managed to get the Cherry Blossom Hairpin, which went to National Treasures.</p>
 <p>When she was logging off, she remembered how National Treasures had clutched the Cherry Blossom Hairpin in her hands while laughing evilly at her.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly didn’t feel like going to the offline meetup anymore. She was feeling a little troubled.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for her, time passed in the blink of an eye, and it was already Saturday. On Wednesday, Yiju gave out more information about where and when the offline meetup would be held. It would be held over a two day period on Saturday and Sunday, at B City’s Panlong Kaiyuan Intercontinental Hotel.</p>
 <p>Truth be told, Shen Jingbin had received an SMS from Xiangpeng on Wednesday when the information was released.</p>
 <p>Yiju’s higher-ups had attached a great deal of importance to the offline meetup. As such, they wanted to invite Shen Jingbin to attend, which also served as a perk for the other players.</p>
 <p>When Shen Jingbin thought of how she’d be with Zhao Chengning and the rest of the members of Jade Sea Pavilion, and how she probably wouldn’t have the time, she decided to reject their offer.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s rejection caused Xiangpeng to fall into a slump for some time. That is until he saw Shen Jingbin at the hotel’s entrance on Saturday, and he felt even worse.</p>
