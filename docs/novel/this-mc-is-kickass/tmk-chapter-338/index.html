 <p><b>Chapter 338: A Race Against Time (2)</b></p>
 <p>The Four Divine Beasts saw an increase in stats after unlocking their human form. Their intelligence had also increased greatly, improving their cooperation with Shen Jingbin and company.</p>
 <p>Before this, their party had fallen into their old habits of fighting Jue Tian like they would a world BOSS. But, they’d forgotten one thing: that Jue Tian wasn’t meant to be defeated by them. Having remembered that point, they no longer persisted in stubbornly trying to eliminate him, and instead switched to a different tactic. They would partly lead and partly force Jue Tian over to Reincarnation Pagoda.</p>
 <p>Due to his stats being cut in half and the Four Divine Beasts taking on a human form, it only took a little while to force Jue Tian to follow along with their plan.</p>
 <p>When he saw his Sect Leader being led away, the Grand Elder turned his back on Zhang Wudi and attempted to go to Jue Tian’s aid. But, it looked like Jue Tian had a better grasp of the situation than the Grand Elder did. “Don’t worry about me! Gather some people and destroy the Lamp of Life!”</p>
 <p>Jue Tian’s voice boomed throughout the area. Not only could the Grand Elder hear it, all of the players could as well. The Shinra Sect players suddenly remembered that their primary mission wasn’t to cut down disciples of the righteous sect, but rather to destroy the Watchtower of Longevity and the Lamp of Life. While killing other players might be fun, they still needed to win in the end!</p>
 <p>“Everyone, our target is the Watchtower of Longevity and the Lamp of Life!” Nine Ballads no longer devoted all her efforts to ambushing the members of Jade Sea Pavilion, and instead made a beeline for the Watchtower of Longevity.</p>
 <p>During this time, Shen Jingchen and Next Week Is Unlikely hurriedly organised the players from the Six Great Sects.</p>
 <p>“Form up; our mission is to protect the Watchtower of Longevity! Quiet And Steadfast’s group has already driven Jue Tian to the Reincarnation Pagoda! All we need to do is guard the Watchtower of Longevity and we’ll win!”</p>
 <p>The players from the Six Great Sects gathered and formed a human wall to block the Shinra Sect’s advance. Due to their numerical superiority, they were even able to send a number of elite players ahead to the Watchtower of Longevity.</p>
 <p>The Six Great Sects had discrepancies in their individual power levels, while those from the Shinra Sect were amongst the more elite players. If the ones at the front weren’t able to hold back the Shinra Sect, they’d at least still have another line of defence.</p>
 <p>With Shen Jingchen in command of the rearguard, all of the large scale guilds picked out several of their elite players and sent them along with him to the Watchtower of Longevity to act as the last line of defence. Next Week Is Unlikely took charge of the vanguard with the Guild Leaders from Imperial City, Memelord, and a few of the other larger guilds. Players from Sovereign’s Descent and Life At First Sight were too embarrassed to ask for a leading role. Because, by this point, some unsavory rumours were floating around about their guilds.</p>
 <p>For example: Reckless East Emperor is part of the Shinra Sect. There was also someone who personally saw Nine Ballads disappear with someone who was suspected to be Reckless East Emperor in the Underworld. There was also the fact that the Leaders of both guilds weren’t present even at such a critical stage of the battle.</p>
 <p>Longtime players of this game were no fools. All it took was a bit of thinking, some hints, and they’d be able to figure out what was going on.</p>
 <p>Under these circumstances, the members of Sovereign’s Descent and Life At First Sight were akin to traitors amongst the players of the Six Great Sects. With all eyes on them, there was no way they’d try to do anything funny.</p>
 <p>On the Shinra Sect side of things, Nine Ballads had joined up with Tiny Little Loli, Crying Fish, and the rest of them. Neverending Journey had also gathered additional forces. Their objective was simple: to break through the human wall in one fell swoop before dispersing and launching sneak attacks on the Watchtower of Longevity and the Lamp of Life.</p>
 <p>Jue Tian suddenly gave a cold smile. “You think this little plaything will be able to destroy me? Dream on! I’ll destroy this thing now, and then we’ll see if you still have any ideas left on how to defeat me!”</p>
 <p>With that, Jue Tian flew up and made his way to the top of Reincarnation Pagoda.</p>
 <p>A faint outline of the pagoda’s eighth level could already be seen. But, it had yet to fully materialise. Based on the way Jue Tian was acting, there was no way the eighth level could withstand his attack.</p>
 <p>There was always this thought bothering Quiet And Steadfast. Even if Jue Tian’s stats had been halved, the plan to bring him to Reincarnation Pagoda shouldn’t have gone so smoothly. Now, it was clear that Jue Tian had intended to come here, and he was planning to destroy the one thing that posed the greatest threat to him.</p>
 <p>“We can’t let him near the eighth level!” shouted Pure Crane as he chased after Jue Tian. Pure Crane planned to get in front of Jue Tian and obstruct him, but he was obviously no match for the latter.</p>
 <p>“Azure Dragon, Black Tortoise, block his path!” Shen Jingbin commanded.</p>
 <p>The Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise weren’t affected by being in the water, so they quickly caught up to Jue Tian. Each of them grabbed onto a leg and viciously dragged Jue Tian back down.</p>
 <p>Jue Tian’s face was filled with malice, and with a flip of his hand, he launched a wide range skill at the Black Tortoise and Azure Dragon. The two of them managed to endure the attack, and with that, they bought enough time for everyone else to catch up.</p>
