 <p><b>Chapter 115: The Goddess Attends Class (1)&nbsp;</b><span style>After hanging up, Xiaohe discreetly prodded Huajuan’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan was currently preoccupied with using a book to cover a Korean drama that she was watching on her handphone, “What’re you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaohe pushed her phone towards Jiangmeng who was sitting further inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hey, hey, what do you think you’re doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shush! Don’t make so much noise, otherwise Abbess Li might find out… Jingjing just called me and said that she’ll be attending lessons with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiangmeng handed Huajuan’s handphone back to her. “Why did Little Jing come back?” She asked as she shifted further inside by one seat. Hearing that Shen Jingbin would be coming, Huajuan also obediently shifted seats. Xiaohe remained where she was seated at the end of the table, leaving Huajuan’s recently vacated seat for Shen Jingbin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, she just said that she was back for a visit. She had nothing better to do, so she decided to attend class with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Li taught Marketing, and this module consisted of both second and third year university students. As Abbess Li was far too terrifying, Xiaohe and the rest always made sure to arrive early so that they could nab the seats at the back of the class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin immediately spotted her friends when she slipped into the classroom through the backdoor. She got lucky, because at present, Abbess Li’s back was towards her and she was currently writing on the blackboard. Shen Jingbin bent down and quietly jogged towards Xiaohe and the rest. Xiaohe shot a glance at Abbess Li. It looked like she wouldn’t turn around for the time being, so Xiaohe quickly stood up and allowed Shen Jingbin to move past her to sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Little Jingjing!~” The moment she sat down, Huajuan very excitedly pounced on her and gave her a bear hug. “Absence makes the heart grow fonder!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin ignored her and pushed her away, “How much perfume did you spray on yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What perfume? She’s using X Goddess Perfume and she dumped half a bottle on her body,” Xiaohe said accusingly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan glared at her. “Pui! Xiaohe you little shit, how can you be so malicious?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Realizing her friends were becoming increasingly rowdy, Jiangmeng shot a worried glance at Abbess Li who was standing on the stage. “Hey, hey, hey, quiet down a bit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if to give credence to her words, Abbess Li, who was writing on the blackboard the whole time, suddenly turned around and swept her gaze towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, the four of them immediately stilled their breathing on reflex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of bewilderment washed over Shen Jingbin. </span><i><span style>Why was she feeling guilty?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully, the lecture hall was large enough and there were sufficient students across both grades to fill up the classroom. Abbess Li only swept a glance across the room without lingering on their posse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four of them collectively heaved a sigh of relief when Abbess Li turned back and continued to sketch out her graph. Jiangmeng glared at her two roommates who’d managed to cheat death, before she asked Shen Jingbin, “So, why’d you come over today? I don’t think there’s anything big going on in school.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling Xiaohe and Huajuan’s curiosity filled gaze directed at her, Shen Jingbin said, “There’s a girl who’s staying over at my place. I drove her to her exam and I’ll be picking her up later as well. In the meantime, I decided to pay you guys a visit since I had nothing else to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oooh~ So we’re just being used to kill time,” Xiaohe said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She really had an expression that made people feel like beating her up, so Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but give her a rap on the head before she said, “That’s what you get for being so snarky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaohe silently stuck her tongue out at Shen Jingbin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Shen Jingbin did her best to reduce her presence, she’d already drawn the attention of numerous gazes the moment she entered the classroom. Everyone within the classroom was a second or third year university student, so each and every one of them knew about her. News of her arrival had spread like wildfire through the entire classroom within minutes of her appearance as they spoke in hushed whispers. There were even people who occasionally stuck their heads out to sneak a peek at where Shen Jingbin and co were sitting. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Li had a thorough understanding of her subject, but her method of teaching was far too inflexible. The classroom’s atmosphere was stifling whenever she taught, and most of the students had their heads buried in their books as they took notes, only occasionally speaking when their names were mentioned by her. As such, today’s lively atmosphere was a rarely seen one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our great Goddess’ charms hasn’t waned a single bit, stirring the hearts of all wherever she goes,” Huajuan said, her heart filled with emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin rolled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A male student sitting beneath their row was stealing a glance at her when he saw it. In that moment, his heart started beating wildly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my god! What should I do? The Goddess looks so cute when she’s rolling her eyes!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He wanted to become a fan of the Goddess!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After sketching out the graph on the blackboard, Li Qing turned back and found that something seemed to be a little off with her class today. Glancing around, she saw that be it male or female, all of her students were filled with vigor. Their backs were ramrod straight and their eyes sparkled; they were the very picture of concentration. If their occasional glances hadn’t given them away, she would’ve thought that they’d finally noticed her charms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She followed their gazes and stared at the spot they were looking at with rapt attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the class was filled with a dense mass of a hundred bobbing heads, she could still instantly tell who it was that had attracted everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had nothing to do with her being keen eyed; a crane would always stand out in a flock of chickens. &nbsp;Regardless of how many there were, you’d still be able to pick out the crane with a single glance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>And Shen Jingbin was that very crane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing had taught countless students over the years, but none of them had ever left an impression as deep as Shen Jingbin did. Although Shen Jingbin was the most beautiful girl she’d ever seen, Shen Jingbin was more than just another pretty face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She obviously knew about Shen Jingbin’s wealthy background. After all, her family had donated twelve experiment rooms to the school the year she’d enrolled. Despite that, she bore no trace of the arrogance, willfulness, and irritability that the rich heirs of today possessed. Instead, she was a bright and witty young woman. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because of these traits, she rarely needed to attend lectures and tutorials. And, on account of the twelve experiment rooms that her family had donated, the school decided to close one eye when she skipped classes. In spite of that, she was always the first to complete her assignments in class. More importantly, they were also extremely well written. To top it off, she nabbed the top score in her finals as well. Out of curiosity, she had asked the other teachers about her performance in their classes, and found that she excelled in every assignment she was tasked with. </span></p>
 <p><span style>From that day onwards, Li Qing decided to be more mindful of Shen Jingbin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she found out that Shen Jingbin had maxed out her course credits, so there was no need for her to attend school. This led to a bout of regret from Li Qing at first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, little did she expect that she’d actually see Shen Jingbin herself in her classroom.</span></p>
