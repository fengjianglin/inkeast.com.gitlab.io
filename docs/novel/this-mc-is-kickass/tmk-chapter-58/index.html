 <p><strong>Chapter 58: Evil Schemes (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what’re you up to?” Quiet And Steadfast happened to hear her as he walked over with Shen Jingbin, likely coming forward after noticing that the groups in front still hadn’t moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen and Next Week Is Unlikely looked back at the approaching pair, while the other members of Jade Sea Pavilion who were clustered together parted. This spontaneously created a pathway for Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast to walk through abreast. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The married duo stood firmly beside Shen Jingchen and Next Week Is Unlikely in their wedding attire. Their loud, fiery red clothes that symbolized the joyous occasion pierced Crying Fish’s eyes as she looked at them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, in what way am I inferior to this ugly monster? Why would you choose her over me?!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast glanced at her, but the red veil that covered his face prevented her from making out his expression. She could only tell that his ink black eyes were completely filled with hatred.</span></p>
 <p>“I just don’t want to marry you. This has nothing to do with anyone else,” He paused for a moment before continuing. “I’ve always been very curious about something. Who exactly is that look of betrayal on your face directed at? If I remember correctly, I’ve never made any attempts to lead you on before.”</p>
 <p>The rims of Crying Fish’s eyes reddened even further. She sounded a little hysterical as she shriek, “Why won’t you give me a chance?! I like you so much! Why aren’t you willing to give me a reply?! Do you know how many guys chase after me every day?! But because of you, I don’t even give them a second glance! Why do you still treat me this way even after all I’ve done for you?!”</p>
 <p>Slight Chill couldn’t help but scoff, “Did our Guild Leader ask you to do any of this? Your princess syndrome must be really serious.”</p>
 <p>“Shut up! This has nothing to do with you!”</p>
 <p>“Your grandfather it doesn't! I dare you to f*cking say that again if you’ve got the balls!”</p>
 <p>After being roared at by Crying Fish, the anger that Slight Chill took great pains to quell flared up once again. She strode forward, intent on facing off with Crying Fish, but was stopped by Quiet And Steadfast’s outstretched hand. He looked towards her and gently shook his head, before she indignantly let the matter slide.</p>
 <p>With a frown on his face, Quiet And Steadfast said, “I’ve never been interested in you, nor do I have any emotional attachment towards you. Just say whatever it is you want to say today, don’t bother asking me about the ‘hows’ and the ‘whys’. There’s nothing for us to talk about.”</p>
 <p>“Fine, I won’t beat about the bush since you’ve made your point clear. In that case, let’s exchange some pointers and compete in a battle. If I lose, I’ll immediately leave with my men. If I win, you’ll immediately file for divorce and marry me instead.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that was the final straw for Shen Jingchen. She was trying to undermine his little sister in a f*cking brazen manner! “Can you be any more shamless than this? Crying Fish, I’ve never met anyone more shameless than you. Do you really think that you can block our path with so few people? Don’t screw around with me!”</p>
 <p>Crying Fish gave a smile. “Then why don’t you find out for yourself and see if it’s enough to stop you guys?”</p>
 <p>She raised her fair hand. At her command, four players behind her formed a group and ripped open an enormous net as they looked at everyone from Jade Sea Pavilion.</p>
 <p>There was a tool in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; that could be used to trap players. It was the very same net that Nine Ballads had used to capture Shen Jingbin. However, such a net was extremely expensive. It was several times more expensive than a server-wide Blossom Rain. Moreover, it was a single use consumable item, which meant that it was an item even your typical nouveau riche might abstain from using.</p>
 <p>It also had a very fitting name — Golden Binding Net.</p>
 <p>A Golden Binding Net could trap up to four players at one time. What’s more, players trapped inside the Golden Binding Net would still remain in the net even if they went offline and came back online again. The only exception was when the player died, then they would no longer remain inside the net.</p>
 <p>However, one Golden Binding Net could only be used for three hours. After three hours, the trapped players would regain their freedom.</p>
 <p>But to the members of Jade Sea Pavilion, playing right into the palms of a woman like Crying Fish was practically like a vicious slap across their faces. It was more serious than killing them, so don’t even mention three hours of being captured, they couldn’t even stand being in their opponent’s grasp for three seconds.</p>
 <p>Everyone from Jade Sea Pavilion were originally indifferent about the situation, but seeing Crying Fish unveil so many Golden Binding Nets, their expressions immediately faltered.</p>
 <p>How much would it cost to buy so many Golden Binding Nets? It seems as though Crying Fish had really blown her top.</p>
 <p>The temperature around Quiet And Steadfast had also lowered quite a significant amount due to the presence of the Golden Binding Nets. Shen Jingbin, who was standing beside him, could clearly feel the anger being emitted from his body.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll fight you.” Quiet And Steadfast said as he suppressed his anger.</p>
 <p>Crying Fish said, “Wait a moment. Who said I wanted to fight with you? You’re the number one player in the game, not even Nine Ballads is a match for you. Isn’t fighting with you the same as sending myself to my death? I want that ugly monster beside you to fight it out with Nine Ballads!”</p>
 <p>Once those words left her mouth, the members of Jade Sea Pavilion couldn’t help but curse at her shamelessness.</p>
 <p>Who was Nine Ballads!? Compared to her, who was Nutjob!? How daring of her!</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen was practically about to faint from anger. His handsome face was flushed with anger as he roared, “You’re shameless!”</p>
 <p>Nine Ballads, who’d remained silent the entire time, raised her eyelids and looked towards Shen Jingbin who stood beside Quiet And Steadfast. With a smile that wasn’t a smile, she said, “Weren’t you very impressive that day? Why’re you playing dead today? You can just say it if you’re feeling scared...”</p>
 <p>Without giving her the chance to finish, Shen Jingbin cut her off and said, “Yeah, I’m scared.”</p>
 <p>The hostile aura of the crowds suddenly deflated.</p>
 <p>Nine Ballads: “...”</p>
 <p>Everyone: <i>“What the f*ck!? Elder sister, how can you be so blunt?!”</i></p>
 <p>The rest of what Nine Ballads had to say was now stuck in her throat. Her expression immediately contorted into an exceedingly ugly one as she uttered, “Are you making a fool out of me?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin replied with a serious look on her face. “Are you suffering from paranoia? If you are, I suggest that you go and see a psychiatrist.”</p>
 <p>The overly serious expression she had on her face was a stark contrast to the ashen look on Nine Ballads’ own, which abruptly dispelled the anger that the members of Jade Sea Pavilion felt.</p>
 <p>Crying Fish ground her teeth and glared at Shen Jingbin. “What’s the meaning of this, Nutjob?! Are you looking down on us?! What’s there to be so smug about?! Mark my words, things won’t turn out well for you!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin let out a sigh, feeling even more helpless than she did before. She turned towards Quiet And Steadfast and asked, “Has she always been unable to understand what other people are saying?” She shifted her line of sight as she cast a sympathetic look towards her fellow comrades from Jade Sea Pavilion. “Putting up with her for so long must’ve been difficult. You guys have worked hard.”</p>
 <p>Amused by her performance, Quiet And Steadfast mimicked her helplessness and said, “Our hands are tied. We feels helpless too since our IQ isn’t up to snuff.”</p>
 <p>“Stop acting like a smartass! Come at me if you’ve got the stones for it, ugly monster. If not, get Quiet And Steadfast out here and f*ck off!” Nine Ballads couldn’t be bothered with any more small talk, so she immediately made her intentions known.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin shot her a look of disdain and said, “You’re clearly afraid of me rejecting you, yet you still want to act as if you’re being magnanimous by giving me a chance to choose. What’s the point of all of this? Quiet And Steadfast and I are already married, so I’m sorry, but I can’t let him go. As for me getting lost…” She raised her chin up and stared at them. “What right do you have to ask that of me?”</p>
 <p>“You…!” Shen Jingbin looked far too arrogant, which caused Nine Ballads to immediately seethe with anger. She unsheathed her sword and charged straight at Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>“Nine Ballads!” Crying Fish was shocked by Nine Ballads, but immediately cried out after she came back to her senses in an attempt to stop her. Unfortunately for her, it was already far too late to stop Nine Ballads.</p>
 <p>A devious smile formed on Shen Jingbin’s lips, it was one that implied that her evil schemes had gone as planned[1. All according to keikaku]. She took an abrupt step forward, and walked straight into Nine Ballads’ sword.</p>
 <p>Watching Nutjob’s movements, Nine Ballads knew that she’d fallen for the other party’s trap. Even so, she couldn’t retract her sword in time. She could only helplessly watch on as the tip of her blade pierced Nutjob’s chest.</p>
 <p>In the instant the tip of Nine Ballads’ sword pierced through Shen Jingbin’s chest, an iron chain descended from the heavens and wound itself around Nine Ballads, trapping her within it. And with a tug…</p>
 <p>Nine Ballads was sent straight to prison under everyone’s gaze.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin waved her hand and kindly said, “Safe travels! I’ll visit you when I’m free!”</p>
 <p>Everyone: <i>“... So cool, much amaze. Wow.”</i></p>
