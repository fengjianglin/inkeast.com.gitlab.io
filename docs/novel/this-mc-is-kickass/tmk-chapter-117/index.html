 <p><b>Chapter 117: Rumour Has It There’s Gods About (1)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Students, while I know you’re excited about seeing the Goddess, please remember that we’re still in class. Just because I don’t say anything doesn’t mean I don’t know what you’re doing, so I hope all of you can exercise some restraint,” Li Qing knew exactly what was going on in the minds of her students. Naturally, the male student who’d been tossing papers at Shen Jingbin hadn’t escaped her gaze either. However, singling others out wasn’t pleasant, so she decided to show some kindness and issued a warning to the class instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the students heard this, all of them; be it those who were scheming or those who weren’t, instantly felt a chill run down their spines and paid attention to the lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might have been Abbess Li’s warnings, but Shen Jingbin didn’t receive any more unknown balls of paper for the second half of the lesson. Even the fervent gazes that were directed at her from all sides of the lecture hall had been greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaohe and co only had this one lesson in the morning, and it was almost ten by the time they were done with the lecture. After pondering over it for a bit, Shen Jingbin decided to have a stroll through one of the food streets at the school’s back gate with her roommates, before returning to First High and picking up Qu Yanxin. With her mind made up, she gave Shen Jingchen a call to ask if he’d be interested in coming along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s two roommates had already left for their internships, while his one remaining roommate was preparing for an entrance exam. After playing around for a bit with this remaining roommate that he had a rather good relationship with, Shen Jingchen received a call from Shen Jingbin. They immediately agreed to meet her and excitedly rushed out the door after tidying themselves up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s worth mentioning was that Shen Jingchen’s roommates were also Shen Jingbin’s fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, most of the students would immediately pack up and leave once the bell rang. However, for today, the lecture hall was still packed with people even though it had been awhile since the lesson had ended. A closer inspection revealed that the ones who&nbsp;left made up a very small portion of the class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she tidied up the lectern, Li Qing looked up to see the rest of the students still milling about the lecture hall. Sweeping her gaze about, she found that Shen Jingbin still sitting at the back of the class and realized why everyone was still around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With slow, measured steps, Li Qing approached Shen Jingbin and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shen Jingbin, why’d you suddenly feel like coming to attend my class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was currently chatting with Huajuan and the rest when she heard someone call out her name from behind her. Her very first reaction after that was to immediately think of who the voice belonged to before she turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After realizing who the person standing in front of her was, Shen Jingbin immediately shot up from her seat and said, “Teacher Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing nodded her head at Shen Jingbin and said, “I didn’t really approve of you ditching classes originally, but after today, I think you not attending is a good thing. These brats already have enough trouble focusing on normal days, and now with you around, it’s even worse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rare look of embarrassment surfaced on Shen Jingbin’s face when she was teased by Li Qing. “Teacher Li, please don’t make fun of me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard you’ve maxed out your course credits?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad. What do you plan to do next time? Do you plan to take the entrance exams or look for a job?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think I’ll be taking the entrance exams.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing had long since expected this outcome. To someone like Shen Jingbin, sitting for an entrance exam was a waste of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She then shot another glance at the crowd sitting around Shen Jingbin and said, “You guys have something on after this, right? Then I won’t hold you back. As for the rest of you, don’t only think of enjoying yourselves all the time. I’ll be taking a look at the homework I gave out last time, so make sure you do a good job. Ask Shen Jingbin if there’s anything you’re unsure of. You should make good use of your connections since you’re acquainted with someone as intelligent as her.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Huajuan, Xiaohe, and Jiangmeng very obediently nodded their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We understand. Thank you, Teacher Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing opened her mouth again and felt like exhorting them once more when she was interrupted by her handphone’s ringtone. She picked up her phone and glanced at Shen Jingbin’s group, before she then stepped out of the lecture hall and received her call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god, baby girl was almost scared to death. My legs turned to jelly the moment Abbess Li looked at me!” Came Huajuan’s disappointing exclamation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of them eyed her with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jingjing, you need to leave before eleven, right? Where’s Shen Jingchen right now?” Jiangmeng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He just left the dormitory so he shouldn’t be too long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she said that, Li Qing walked back into the lecture hall and swept a glance across the room. Seeing that many of the students were still lingering behind, she raised her voice and said, “It’s a good thing so many of you are still around. In that case, I’ll just let the ones here know, so that all of you can inform the rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s attention was drawn to what she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve just been informed that if all goes well, a very accomplished entrepreneur will be here to give a speech the same time next week. This speech will mainly be directed at the third year students. However, any second years interested are also free to drop by. The school has especially arranged it for you students of the Management Department, so everyone needs to be present. I’ll be monitoring the attendance very strictly. Class monitors of the third year classes; please take note and inform your classmates later on to ensure that everyone has been informed,” On top of teaching the second and third year students Marketing, Li Qing was also the head of the third year cohort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lecture hall immediately fell into an uproar once she finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing walked up to Shen Jingbin once again and said, “Did you catch what I said just now? Although you don’t need to attend school, you should still drop by to listen if you have the time. Listening to someone else’s experiences will definitely be beneficial to you in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing voiced her heartfelt wishes towards Shen Jingbin and her tone was filled with kindness. &nbsp;Shen Jingbin didn’t want to brush aside her goodwill, so she said, “Alright, I’ll be there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qing gave her a satisfied look before she turned to the other three around her, and exhorted them once again before she took her leave.</span></p>
