 <p><strong>Chapter 21: Version Update (1)&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Notification: The Demonic Sect’s protector, Du the Unvanquished, is one of Shinra Sect’s generals and possesses extraordinary strength. Players are recommended to form a raid group before attempting this quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen and Quiet And Steadfast were locked in battle with Du the Unvanquished. In fact, it looked as if they were falling into a disadvantageous position. Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but feel a little anxious upon seeing this. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned to her surroundings in an attempt to find something that might help. After searching for a while, she finally found a slip of paper in Wu Lang’s sister’s pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification popped up when she opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck! Form a raid group?! In that moment, Shen Jingbin’s mental state crumbled a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;, parties had a maximum limit of five players, while raid groups had a limit of twenty. However, apart from dungeons which required the formation of one, the only other time raid groups were formed was when players tried to tackle a world BOSS.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that case, didn’t the system’s recommendation to form a raid group mean that Du the Unvanquished was an existence on the level of a world BOSS?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of sick joke was this! </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>After pondering it over for a few seconds, Shen Jingbin shouted at the two of them, “Are you guys able to inspect this mob’s<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> level?”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Quiet And Steadfast took the opportunity to launch an appraisal skill at Du the Unvanquished’s back when he wasn’t paying attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when the pretty blue lights of the appraisal skill flashed past him, Quiet And Steadfast noticed that what appeared on top of his head wasn’t his level, but rather a string of scarlet red question marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a slight change in Quiet And Steadfast’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The appraisal skill was a common spell used to distinguish a monster’s level. &nbsp;In general, a monster’s level would be displayed on top of their head when appraisal was cast on them. However, monsters that were of a higher level than the caster wouldn’t display their level. Instead, a string of scarlet red question marks would appear in its place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raising one’s level in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; was a very challenging task. The level cap at present was currently level 130. However, in the game’s two years of service, Quiet And Steadfast was the only one who had achieved a level that exceeded 125.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously, when the leaderboards were refreshed, Quiet And Steadfast was sitting at level 127, 5 levels ahead of the number two player on the leaderboards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If even Quiet And Steadfast couldn’t appraise his level, then that meant he was definitely above level 127.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enemy that was above level 127… there were only a few world BOSSes of that level in the entire game! </span></p>
 <p><span style>So did this mean that both he and Shen Jingchen could go toe to toe against a world BOSS?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of joke was that!</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Dawn, drink a large health potion and kite<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> him. Don’t fight him head on. This mob’s at least level 128, we don’t have any way of dealing with him.” Quiet And Steadfast truly was a guru at the game. He immediately barked out orders to Shen Jingchen after quickly analyzing the situation.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Level 128, what the f*ck! No wonder he hits so hard!” Shen Jingchen immediately exclaimed, “You better hurry up and think of a way to save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast furrowed his brows, “I’m thinking, hold on.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no doubting Shen Jingchen’s strength. Although he looked unreliable, he was still one of the rankers on the leaderboards. However, dragging this out wasn’t a solution either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nut...ah, Nutjob… Look over that NPC once again and check if there’s anything else on her that we can use. This mob’s level is way too high. We can only put up a struggle and hold him back, we can’t kill him.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast still had difficulties calling out Shen Jingbin’s name without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.” Shen Jingbin disregarded his awkwardness, giving only a word of reply before she made her way back to pat down Wu Lang’s sister once again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However this time, she very carefully searched her from head to toe, leaving nothing to chance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Shen Jingbin suddenly heard a “ding” when she touched her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations, you have obtained a limited use summoning talisman. You may summon ten friends to your side. Number of uses: 1/1.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>To the development team: Can you guys be any more perverted?! Don’t you know that such a setting would lead young children astray?!</span></i></p>
