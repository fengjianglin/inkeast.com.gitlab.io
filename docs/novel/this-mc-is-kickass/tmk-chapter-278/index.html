 <p><b>Chapter 278: The Dragonkin’s Lead Disciple (2)</b></p>
 <p>Roughly ten minutes had passed when Pure Crane received a notification. “It’s time. Let’s go check on the furnace.”</p>
 <p>“That quick?” Shen Jingbin asked along the way to the refining room. She knew that the time taken to refine weapons increased based on their quality.</p>
 <p>“I’ve been refining it for three days straight before you came.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked at him with a raised brow. The time needed to refine a weapon would appear after placing the required materials and recipe into a furnace. Weapons of differing grades had different refinement times. However, none of them took more than twenty-four hours. In general, weapons that took more than twenty-four hours to refine would be guaranteed to be items of the highest quality and have the best possible attributes. Shen Jingbin understood the implications of a weapon taking three days to be refined without Pure Crane saying anything.</p>
 <p>This brought up another problem: while you might be able to discern a weapon’s quality based on the time it took, there was no way to know whether you’d actually succeed until the refinement was completed.</p>
 <p>If one’s luck was good, they’d be able to obtain a superior weapon when they finished refining. Otherwise, they’d be met with failure instead, and their dreams of obtaining a superior weapon would remain as that - a dream.</p>
 <p>When she walked in, Shen Jingbin’s eyes were drawn to three enormous furnaces that were placed in the middle of the room, looking very similar to the Highest Elder Lord’s pill refining room. Pure Crane pointed to the metal furnace on the left and said, “It’s that one.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin made her way towards the furnace on the left and placed her hands on top of it.</p>
 <p>“Do you wish to open the forge? Yes/No. Please note: life is ever changing. Please remain calm regardless of the result, young hero. Continue to strive, and the goddess of luck is sure to smile on you.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave a wry smile.&nbsp;<i>What a thoughtful notice.</i></p>
 <p>She selected ‘Yes’ without the slightest bit of hesitation, and the enormous furnace issued a groan. The furnace’s cover began to lift up slowly, and a golden beam of light burst out from within.</p>
 <p><i>Success!</i></p>
 <p>That beam of light was all they needed to see to know whether the refinement was a success and they broke into smiles. Shen Jingbin, in particular, heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Pure Crane received a notification at the same time the golden light burst out.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations, you have successfully forged Demonshaker Skyfrost (Divine). Would you like to make a realm wide announcement? Yes/No.”</p>
 <p>When players refined a weapon of the highest quality, the system would ask whether they’d like to make their achievement known to everyone else. Pure Crane wanted to keep a low profile, and he didn’t want to tip his hand to the disciples of the Shinra Sect either, so he chose no.</p>
 <p>A jet black dagger slowly rose out of the furnace and landed in Pure Crane’s hand.</p>
 <p>As the furnace belonged to Pure Crane, the weapon still belonged to him even though Shen Jingbin was the one who’d opened it.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin knew at a glance that it was a dagger belonging to the Lich class. Pure Crane smiled. “It has to be said, both husband and wife have pretty good luck; the two of you have claimed the first two weapons that were created.” After handing the dagger to her, he continued, “Although rumours are going around that the two of you have fallen out of love, I think you guys are even closer than you were before, right? Here, you can be the one to give him the dagger.”</p>
 <p>“Oh right, that reminds me, we’ve found the Black Tortoise. We plan to look for the Vermillion Bird next,” Shen Jingbin said as she received the dagger.</p>
 <p>Pure Crane paused for a moment. “Mm, I’ll try to speed up refining the Divine Weapons as well. I get the feeling the upcoming battle isn’t far from now.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly received a notification that someone new had joined the guild.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Chance meetings are fated, player Gentle Kite has joined the guild.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Black Kite: Everyone, this is my younger brother!</p>
 <p>The name ‘Black Kite’ sounded rather familiar to Shen Jingbin, but she couldn’t quite place her finger on where she’d heard it before. A few people in the guild popped out to welcome the newcomer. Less than a minute later, two more notifications appeared.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Chance meetings are fated, player Qi Mu has joined the guild.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Chance meetings are fated, player Inking A Message has joined the guild.</p>
 <p>Pure Crane was a little put off by this new development. After the promotional trailer was released, he’d given explicit instructions that no new members were to be added to the guild. And now, three of them had suddenly popped up out of nowhere. On closer inspection, he found that Black Kite was the one who’d approved all of their applications. He decided to message her in private.</p>
 <p><i>“Why’d you suddenly add so many people into the guild? Didn’t I say not to add anyone over the next two days?”</i></p>
 <p><i>“Gentle Kite’s my younger brother, while Qi Mu and Inking A Message are his friends. They weren’t happy in their previous guild, so they asked me to take them in. I felt bad rejecting them, so I added them into the guild. I’m sorry, Brother Pure Crane. ( ͒˃̩̩⌂˂̩̩ ͒)</i></p>
 <p>Pure Crane often found it difficult to get angry when it came to Black Kite. He just sighed in resignation and said, “Remember to tell them that things are a little dicey at the moment. No matter what, they aren’t allowed to divulge any information whatsoever regarding Nutjob.”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane and Black Kite were busy talking amongst themselves, so they obviously didn’t have the time to welcome the two new additions.</p>
 <p>Since none of the guild’s executives had stepped out to greet them, Qi Mu decided to take matters into her own hands instead.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Qi Mu: Is the Guild Leader around? I have something to discuss with you.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Pure Crane: I’m here, what’s up?</p>
 <p>Pure Crane received mail from Qi Mu shortly after sending out his reply.</p>
 <p>“I came over here because I heard that you had most of the Lead Disciples. I’m the Lead Disciple of the Dragonkins.”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane was taken aback. He hurriedly turned to Shen Jingbin and said, “The one who just joined the guild - Qi Mu - is the Lead Disciple of the Dragonkins!”</p>
 <p>“Mm?!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin decisively opened up the guild member list, looked up Qi Mu, and sent her a friend request. At the same time, she sent a message in the guild chat.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Qi Mu, you’re the Lead Disciple of the Dragonkins? Please add me as your friend, thanks.</p>
 <p>[Guild] The Winds Of Ximen: What the f*ck, what the f*ck, the Lead Disciple of the Dragonkins’ joined too? My bro’s so cool!</p>
 <p>When her friend request went through, Shen Jingbin immediately sent a private message to Qi Mu.</p>
 <p>“Hello, where are you now? I have something to discuss with you.”</p>
 <p>After Qi Mu replied with her coordinates, Shen Jingbin had a word with Pure Crane before the two of them rushed over to where Qi Mu was.</p>
