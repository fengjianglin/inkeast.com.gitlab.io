 <p><b>Chapter 238: I’m Always Very Careful (2)</b></p>
 <p>“Did you wait long?” He walked up to her and whispered in her ear.</p>
 <p>“Hmm? You’re here. I didn’t wait long, I just arrived too.”</p>
 <p>Refusing to believe her, Zhao Chengning reached out and grabbed her hand.</p>
 <p>Her hands were freezing. It was obvious that she hadn’t just arrived.</p>
 <p>“It’s so cold; why didn’t you wait inside?” He said as he frowned and wrapped his hands around hers in an attempt to warm them up.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was a little shocked by his actions. “What would you do if you couldn’t see me because I was waiting for you inside? Actually, I really just-” She wanted to explain herself, but didn’t want to raise her head and meet Zhao Chengning’s intense gaze. For a moment, her words were stuck in her throat.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go in, it’s cold outside. Where’s Shen Jingchen?”</p>
 <p>“He went in first.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning shifted to holding Shen Jingbin’s hand instead of clasping it before leading her in.</p>
 <p>The waiter by the entrance was extremely attentive and hurriedly opened the door from the inside for them, eliciting a polite word of thanks from Shen Jingbin as they walked past.</p>
 <p>In that instant, the waiter was so moved by her word of thanks that his face turned red.</p>
 <p>He’d long since seen this beauty standing outside her stomping her feet due to the cold. The heavens knew how much he wanted to strip his clothes off and hand it to her...</p>
 <p>But he was working! It really was exhausting to fall in love.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, the person the beauty was waiting for was about to arrive. He felt rather gratified about that.</p>
 <p>However, he felt weak at the knees when he saw the beauty’s companion.</p>
 <p>The beauty turned out to be waiting for B City’s golden bachelor, Zhao Chengning! His face was frequently featured in finance magazines and on B City’s television stations, so the waiter definitely wouldn’t be mistaken!</p>
 <p>His younger sister would always kneel and lick the magazines that had Zhao Chengning’s picture printed on them!</p>
 <p>His heart suddenly felt heavy. In comparison, didn’t that mean he had no chance whatsoever?</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the beauty belonged to someone else. He’d be better off putting his all into his job.</p>
 <p>The first floor of the restaurant was the reception, while the dining area was on the second floor. A waitress with exquisite makeup on greeted them when they entered. Her eyes lit up when her gaze fell on Zhao Chengning, but immediately dimmed when she saw them holding hands.</p>
 <p>After asking if any of their companions had arrived beforehand, the waitress took them to where Shen Jingchen was seated.</p>
 <p>There were no private rooms left when Shen Jingchen had gone upstairs, so he’d found a seat in the hall instead. After taking a look around, he found himself a seat near the window. It was a rather good seat so he had no complaints about it. However, he realised just how wrong he was when Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning came up.</p>
 <p>A seat near the window meant that they’d have to pass through the whole restaurant before the two of them could reach their table. By the time they’d arrived, they’d become the center of attention.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning let go of Shen Jingbin’s hand and allowed her to walk in front of him.</p>
 <p>The waitress leading the way paused for a moment before speeding up for some strange reason.</p>
 <p>The moment they sat down, Shen Jingchen, who was dripping with jealousy, began to ridicule them, “What the f*ck. You guys are like superstars making a public appearance! Even the entirety of this floor’s lights put together isn’t as bright as you two!”</p>
 <p>Why didn’t he get this kind of treatment when he came up just now?!</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cast a sidelong glance and said, “Ah, thanks for the compliment.”</p>
 <p>“Do I like I’m complimenting you?! You must be confused.”</p>
 <p>After knowing them for so long, Zhao Chengning was no longer fazed by their digs at one another. He took the menu from the waitress and asked Shen Jingchen, “Have you ordered?”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t know what you guys wanted to eat, so I just ordered a few specialty dishes and a portion of chicken strips and abalone congee.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin couldn’t stop herself from making fun of him. “Chicken strips and abalone congee? Do you have the palate of a wealthy landlord?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen indignantly snorted. “Got a problem with it? Then you better not eat any of it later.”</p>
 <p>“Did you actually think I was going to drink any of it? I’ll leave it for you to supplement your kidney.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning wore a smile on his face as he glanced at the duo. “They make good eight divinity congee here. It’s also one of their specialties, so you guys should give it a try.”</p>
 <p>“That’s what I’ll have then,” Shen Jingbin said, shooting a defiant glare at Shen Jingchen sitting across from her in the process.</p>
 <p>Her look seemed to have aggravated Shen Jingchen, who tugged on Zhao Chengning and whined, “Ah Ning, don’t be fooled by her! See how devious she looks?! As a fellow bro and out of the kindness of my heart, I feel that it’s my duty to remind you to be cautious of her.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning laughed as he shut the menu before handing it over to the waitress. He said a few words and turned his gaze to his companions seated at the table.</p>
 <p>“Relax, I’m always very cautious.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen suddenly felt that the two before him were too dazzling to look at, so he quietly covered his eyes and fell silent.</p>
 <p>When Shen Jingbin glanced at Zhao Chengning, she realised that he’d just so happened to be looking at her, causing her to shy away in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>For some reason, she kept feeling like there were some hidden meaning beneath his words.</p>
 <p>After their meal, the trio walked out and found that it was raining. Shen Jingchen and Zhao Chengning borrowed two umbrellas from the doorman to fetch their cars, while Shen Jingbin stayed behind and waited for them at the reception.</p>
 <p>While waiting, she suddenly heard someone call out to her from behind.</p>
 <p>“Miss Shen?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin turned around and saw a girl who had this slightly pure and adorable look about her. She was currently holding a guy’s hand and looking at Shen Jingbin with eyes that were wide with shock.</p>
 <p>“You are?” Shen Jingbin thought this girl looked a little familiar, but couldn’t put her finger on it.</p>
 <p>“I’m Zhang Beiyu. Do you remember me?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin had no recollection of this name, so she didn’t respond and just looked at the girl with slightly furrowed brows.</p>
 <p>Zhang Beiyu laughed bitterly in her heart upon seeing Shen Jingbin’s reaction. However, on the surface, she wore a pitiful expression and said, “Miss Shen, you don’t remember me, right? That’s no surprise. After all, I’m but a lowly waitress in Blooming Flower Pavilion. It’s very normal for Miss Shen to not remember me.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin finally recalled who she was when she spoke in such a manner. Wasn’t this girl the one who’d tried to act out a scene from “The Tyrannical Chairman Pampers Cinderella” in front of Zhao Chengning?</p>
 <p>She wasn’t interested in Zhao Chengning back then, so she hadn’t borne any ill will towards the girl standing before her. But now...</p>
 <p>She had to get rid of everyone who coveted Zhao Chengning!</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin suddenly put on a cold and arrogant facade. The attitude reminiscent of a queen gracing the world with her presence took Zhang Beiyu and her male companion’s breaths’ away.</p>
 <p>“Since it’s normal for me to not recognise you, why are you acting like you’ve been wronged?”</p>
 <p>The blunt manner in which she spoke completely caught Zhang Beiyu off guard.</p>
