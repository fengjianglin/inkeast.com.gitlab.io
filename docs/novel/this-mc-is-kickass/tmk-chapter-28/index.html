 <p><strong>Chapter 28: Another Dispute (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Guild Leader Quiet And Steadfast has logged on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Everyone, take the opportunity to level up as much as you can during this period of time. We’ll be forming a group to take on the new dungeons in three days time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Is Nutjob around?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she was feeling immeasurably satisfied, Shen Jingbin suddenly noticed someone calling out to her in the guild chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Nutjob: I’m here, what’s up?</span></p>
 <p>[Guild} Quiet And Steadfast: Drop whatever it is you’re doing and come leveling with everyone else. The four Monsters, squeeze out some time over the next two days and help her get to 80 before we take on the dungeon.</p>
 <p>Level 80 was the minimum level required to take on the Demonic Sect’s dungeon.</p>
 <p>Level 80?</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked at her own level that was just over 30. Wasn’t this a little too difficult?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: I have some things to take care of during the next two days. I won’t be able to log on, so I won’t need their help.</p>
 <p>After she said that, the entire guild chat instantly fell silent.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t help but look back at what she’d written. <i>There wasn’t anything wrong with it...</i></p>
 <p>It’s about there?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Big Buddhist Nun: This is my first time seeing Leader get rejected by someone!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Faint Blue Seaweed: +1.</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Not A Monster: This kind of sensation...</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Really Not A Monster: Feels kind of...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Actually, I Am A Monster: Good!</p>
 <p>[Guild] I'm A Monster, Dare Hit Me: To the blockheads on top: don’t be an idiot! You shouldn’t say these kinds of things out loud!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Slight Chill: Big sister are you sure you haven’t made a mistake? Everyone in the guild is doing their best to raise their levels so we can vie for the first clear, yet a lowbie like you who entered through the back door is still acting so leisurely. Not only have you made no contributions to the guild, you’re even dragging us down, heh heh.”</p>
 <p>The “heh heh” left at the end of Slight Chill’s message made Shen Jingbin feel as if she was about to choke.</p>
 <p>This person called “Slight Chill” had been at odds with her from the very first day she joined. But Shen Jingbin didn’t think that she’d done anything to offend her? She recalled everything that had happened since she first started playing, and apart from that small conflict with Lil Rose and Brother Reckless, she’d more or less spent all of her time interacting with NPCs!</p>
 <p><i>Little sister, won’t you explain yourself?! </i>Shen Jingbin really felt like reasoning with this girl but thought better of it. After all, she was a member of the guild. It wouldn’t be good if relations between them soured, so she might as well drop the matter.</p>
 <p><i>Who asked her to be such a magnanimous person!</i></p>
 <p>In the end, a certain someone whose name started with Shen decided to sacrifice herself for the good of the world and agreed to the guild’s arrangements. She planned to do so while pretending not to have seen Slight Chill’s scathing comment, letting the issue blow over on its own.</p>
 <p>However unexpectedly, someone jumped in to “shit stir” before she had the chance to respond.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: What a joke, are you saying that other people can’t leave to take care of things in real life? Are you going to insist that everyone be like you and spend all their time eating and shitting in the game? And speaking of burdens, I seem to recall you holding us back many times in the past as well.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin was utterly shocked: <i>What the f*ck! Big bro, are you sure you’re not being too blunt?! You’re gonna make her angry! </i></p>
 <p>[Guild] Slight Chill: Dawn’s Twilight, are you a dog? Do you go around biting everyone you see? What does this lowbie have to do with you? Seeing as you’re so protective of her, you must be having an affair with her, right? That’s right, don’t you love going around and flirting with women? Hmph, this is my first time seeing someone act so self-righteously after entering through the back door. Do you really think that after becoming a member of the guild, you can do whatever you want?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: Take a good look for yourself and see just who’s the one going around biting others. As for Nutjob’s connection with me, is it something that you should concern yourself with? Who the hell are you?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Slight Chill: What goes on in your life is none of my business, and neither am I interested in it. I just can’t stand that arrogant look of yours. What would the other guild members think when they see you protecting a lowbie who hasn’t made a single bit of contribution to the guild? Eh, so it looks like people have to rely on their connections even when they play a game?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: You’re saying she hasn’t made any contribution up till this point? Get your facts straight, bitch. Who was it that helped our guild get a 20% increase in rare drop rate? You were online the day it happened as well. You shouldn’t be blind or senile, right? If you really can’t remember, I wouldn’t mind helping you jog your memory!</p>
 <p>Slight Chill suddenly went silent, but Shen Jingchen wasn’t willing to let it go.</p>
 <p>Did she really think it’d be that easy to escape after bullying his little sister?</p>
 <p><i>Dream on!</i></p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: Don’t just take my word for it. While it’s true that she’s just joined, she’s much better than someone like you who spends all day ridiculing others and trying to supplant them. And, after doing all that, you still have the cheek to criticize others. I’m impressed.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: What’s this, the atmosphere’s a little too severe. Let’s not quarrel and calmly discuss things.</p>
 <p>[Guild} Little Monk: Slight Chill, Dawn, let’s talk things out nicely. Don’t quarrel, don’t quarrel.</p>
 <p>Everyone was part of the same guild, so they naturally wouldn’t allow this endless dispute to continue on. When they noticed both sides starting to simmer down, a number of people jumped in to act as mediators.</p>
 <p>Based on what Shen Jingbin knew of him, although Shen Jingchen was an idiot, he still acted like a gentleman towards women. This was her first time seeing him flare up like this.</p>
 <p><i>Big bro, you’re way too cool!</i></p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: ...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Slight Chill, Dawn’s Twilight, for openly quarrelling in the guild, each of you will contribute 100 taels to the guild’s funds as a fine. After that, find a time to look for me in private.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Nutjob, when you manage to get online, look for the four Monsters and get them to help level you up. Try to hit 80 as soon as you can. We won’t bring you along for our dungeon run this time. As for the rest of you, go do what you’re supposed to do. Do you guys think you’re very free?</p>
