 <p><b>Chapter 159: Love Rivals (1)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>After stepping out from Hundred Daybreaks’ room, Shen Jingbin found Quiet And Steadfast standing outside waiting for her.</p>
 <p>“What did you guys talk about?” Quiet And Steadfast looked like a curious child as he posed his question.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cast a glance at him. “Nothing much.”</p>
 <p><i>Bullshit!</i></p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s lips curled, but he couldn’t do anything about it if Shen Jingbin wasn’t willing to talk.</p>
 <p>“In the future, don’t bring me along when you meet up with Hundred Daybreaks. It’s annoying.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, alright.”</p>
 <p>Things transpired differently from how he’d imagined it, and Quiet And Steadfast was feeling a little wronged by what she’d said.</p>
 <p>He’d originally planned on allowing the two of them to get acquainted so that Shen Jingbin would have someone to turn to if she faced any difficulties. After all, even if Hundred Daybreaks didn’t excel at anything else, she was a savant when it came to information brokering.</p>
 <p>Who would’ve thought that he’d end up shooting himself in the foot? Hundred Daybreaks’ comment about treating her to a meal in real life had caused a misunderstanding between Shen Jingbin and himself.</p>
 <p>In his mind, Quiet And Steadfast imagined a melodramatic misunderstanding. He definitely had to nip this problem in the bud!</p>
 <p>“Actually, Hundred Daybreaks and I don’t have any special relationship in real life. She’s just one of my seniors in school.”</p>
 <p><i>Was this an explanation?</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin eyed him dubiously. “I don’t mind, you don’t need to rush to explain yourself.”</p>
 <p><i>“How can you not mind?! You have to mind!!”&nbsp;</i>Quiet And Steadfast roared in his heart. However, his face remained stoic. “You don’t mind? Then that’s good. I was afraid you might have misunderstood something.”</p>
 <p>“Is what I think that important?” Shen Jingbin asked.</p>
 <p><i>It’s important! Of course, it’s important!!</i></p>
 <p>“We’re husband and wife now, so I don’t want our long-standing relationship to be affected by some random reason.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded her head in approval. “That’s true,” After opening her character page, she continued, “It feels like things are becoming increasingly complex. Is my current level a little too low? It’ll pose some difficulties in overcoming the challenges ahead. Come help me with my leveling if you’ve got the time.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, sure,” This was exactly what Quiet And Steadfast wanted, so he accepted without a moment’s hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, I’ll log off for today. You should rest earlier as well.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, good night.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin logged off after waving him goodbye.</p>
 <p>Once Shen Jingbin had completely disappeared before his eyes, Quiet And Steadfast retracted his gaze and returned to Hundred Daybreaks’ residence.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, it looked like he couldn’t interact too much with some people, otherwise, they’d start coming up with ideas of their own.</p>
 <p>Over the next few days, Shen Jingbin forgot about everything else and gave her all to raising her level with the help of Quiet And Steadfast. When he wasn’t online, she’d pair up with either Shen Jingchen, Next Week Is Unlikely, the Four Monsters, or any of the other elites within the guild.</p>
 <p>However, as her level was quite high now, she still leveled very slowly even with the help of all the Gods within the guild. At the end of it, she only managed to claw her way to level 99.</p>
 <p>The Four Monsters were very considerate and tried to console her.</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to rush, you’re already leveling very fast,” Said I’m Not A Monster.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right. You’re almost leveling at the same rate we did back then,” Chimed in I’m Really Not A Monster.</p>
 <p>“Pui, how can you of all people say that! Back then, you were the slowest amongst us all when we were rushing to level! Nutty’s way faster than you,” Actually, I Am A Monster retorted.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, all you know how to do is brag. F*cking shameless!” I’m A Monster, Dare To Hit Me added.</p>
 <p>“Alright, the two of you, stop fighting!”</p>
 <p>“You looking for a fight? You got it! You think I’m afraid of you?!”</p>
 <p>“Hey, you guys want to pick a fight? A two on one isn’t fair. Second Brother, I’ll help you!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin: ...</p>
 <p>The four of them looked hilarious as they bickered amongst themselves.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin thought back to the lecture that Teacher Li Qing had exhorted her to attend. Knowing that she’d have to wake up earlier to return to school, Shen Jingbin interrupted the Four Monsters’ scuffle and told them that they wouldn’t need to wait for her tomorrow before she logged off.</p>
 <p>Having logged off a lot earlier than she usually did, Shen Jingbin mulled it over for a bit before deciding to whip something up for dinner. While eating out every day was convenient, there were always some days when she’d feel like cooking up something on her own.</p>
 <p>Although her culinary skills weren’t spectacular, they were, at the very least, still edible. This was why Shen Jingchen snubbing her cooking made her...</p>
 <p><i>Hahaha, who cares about him? He can just starve if he doesn’t want to eat!</i></p>
 <p>As the siblings hadn’t eaten at home for the past few days, the fridge was practically empty. Seeing as she still had time, Shen Jingbin decided to go grocery shopping.</p>
 <p>When Shen Jingbin returned home with her bags of groceries, she was surprised to find Shen Jingchen sitting in the living room.</p>
 <p>This guy only appeared whenever it was time to eat, so seeing him now was truly a rare occurrence.</p>
 <p>When he heard her open the door, Shen Jingchen got to his feet and sniffed. “Where’d you go… F*ck, why are you carrying so many things? What are you up to?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin used her leg to close the door and replied, “It’s for eating. There’s nothing left in the fridge.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me you’re planning to cook tonight?” Shen Jingchen ran over to her and grabbed a bag. When he opened it, he was greeted by a bag full of fresh produce.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave him a rare look of approval and said, “How rare, looks like your IQ’s working today.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a look of horror dawned on Shen Jingchen’s face. “F*ck, don’t scare me like that!”</p>
 <p>A forced smile appeared on Shen Jingbin’s face as she cast a sidelong glance at him. “Haha, you only have two choices: either eat or starve.”</p>
 <p>A smug grin suddenly appeared on Shen Jingchen’s face. “Nonono, my dear little sister, you have to listen to my plans for tonight.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin glared daggers at him.</p>
 <p>Pretending he hadn’t seen anything, Shen Jingchen said, “Ah Ning’s coming to A City today. We can’t possibly ask him to eat something that&nbsp;<b>you’ve&nbsp;</b>cooked, right? Please, that’s practically asking him for his life!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin froze as she was setting down the groceries. “He’s coming over? Why haven’t I heard anything about this?”</p>
 <p>“Tch, he wanted to give you a surprise. He even asked me not to tell you anything… To be honest, I wouldn’t even be telling you about it now, but how am I supposed to trick you into going to a restaurant? Who would’ve thought you’d give us a surprise before we sprung one on you. How terrifying.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin eyed him doubtfully. “Are you telling the truth?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I lie to you? If that weren’t the case do you think I’d still be out here?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, so even you know that you’re normally a lazy bum huh?”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p><i>F*ck, that’s not the point alright?!</i></p>
 <p>“So, do you believe me or not?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll reluctantly believe you just this once.”</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and change your clothes, we’ll be going to the airport. Ah Ning’s about to touchdown.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Shen Jingbin shoved everything she was holding into his arms. “I’ll leave these to you. Go forth, youth.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
