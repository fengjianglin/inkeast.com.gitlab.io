 <p><b>Chapter 164: The Director’s Rampage (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>After walking past the Management students, Shen Jingbin was immediately assaulted by a number of dissatisfied stares.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin looked towards the face that held the most dissatisfaction in it.</p>
 <p>Luo Xiaoqian.</p>
 <p><i>Tch, she’s everywhere.</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin cursed Luo Xiaoqian in her heart. Without even sparing a glance for her, Shen Jingbin acted as if she hadn’t noticed her and continued walking towards the auditorium’s exit.</p>
 <p>“Eh? You mean even our Goddess has times when she’s down on her luck?” Luo Xiaoqian sarcastically remarked as they walked past her.</p>
 <p>Huajuan swept a glance at her. She couldn’t recognise Luo Xiaoqian, but Huajuan felt that Luo Xiaoqian was definitely looking for a beating. “Who are you?” Huajuan shot back unkindly.</p>
 <p>“Senior is very impressive. You don’t even know what should and shouldn’t be asked.”</p>
 <p>“What the f*ck are you trying to get at?” Huajuan said as she rolled up her sleeves and walked towards Luo Xiaoqian.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Shen Jingbin grabbed Huajuan and said, “Don’t bother arguing with a passerby. Let’s go, the Director is more important.”</p>
 <p>That’s true, why would she bother picking a fight with a small fry like Luo Xiaoqian. To her, Luo Xiaoqian was nothing more than an uninvolved passerby. At the most, she was just some small-time villain.</p>
 <p>She certainly wouldn’t waste her time on someone like that.</p>
 <p>“Shen Jingbin, you…”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin immediately interrupted her and said coldly, “Fellow student, a word of warning: don’t take my kindness when I tolerate you as weakness. Don’t blame me for getting nasty if you keep this up.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin always had the air of a beauty. When she lowered her voice, it felt as if she’d become xxxxxxxx.</p>
 <p>Once Shen Jingbin was far off in the distance, Luo Xiaoqian’s roommate walked up to her fearfully and asked, “Xiaoqian, what kind of stunt were you trying to pull just now? Why do you insist on provoking that Senior?!” That Senior’s murderous gaze was so strong that even she, who was standing at the back, was frozen to the spot in fear.</p>
 <p>“What? Are you afraid of being implicated? Then stay away from me!”</p>
 <p>Luo Xiaoqian, who’d been cowed by Shen Jingbin with just one look, felt like she’d thoroughly humiliated herself. Upon hearing what her roommate said, she immediately flew into a rage and vented her anger at her. With a roar, she flung her roommate’s hand away and stomped away, leaving her dumbstruck roommate behind.</p>
 <p><i>Was she planning to provoke everyone she comes across?</i></p>
 <p>At this moment, the girl who sat beside the two of them from before patted her shoulder “Junior, you should be a little more careful of who you befriend in the future,” She said, a deeper meaning hidden beneath her words.</p>
 <p>The Director slowly arrived after around ten minutes had passed.</p>
 <p>The moment he walked in, the Director slammed a stack of A4 paper onto his desk. “Huajuan, right? Were you trying to intentionally disrupt the lecture? I repeatedly reminded all of you not to ask nonsensical questions, yet you still did it!”</p>
 <p>“I’m… I’m sorry Director. I didn’t do it on purpose,” Huajuan shamefully replied.</p>
 <p>“Do you really think that a word of apology is enough to cut it? I’ll have you know that it took a great deal of effort to invite Mr Zhao over. If he has a bad impression of our Management Department because of you... Well, just wait and see what I’ll do to you! Write me a ten thousand self-reflection essay to reflect on your actions!” Once he was done with Huajuan, the Director turned his attention to Shen Jingbin once again. “Shen Jingbin, you’re the top student in the Management Department, I didn’t expect you to join in on this nonsense as well!”</p>
 <p>When Huajuan noticed the Director setting his sights on Shen Jingbin, Huajuan very loyally jumped in to speak up for her. “Director, Shen Jingbin had nothing to do with this. I was just caught up in the moment when I asked that question and dragged her into it. She didn’t know anything about it.”</p>
 <p>“Quiet! Was I talking to you?” Huajuan’s sudden interruption caused the Director’s anger to flare up even more.</p>
 <p>Huajuan shrunk back.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin patted Huajuan’s back, indicating for her not to speak any further.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, Director. Today’s incident was our fault. If possible, we’d like to apologize to Mr Zhao.”</p>
 <p>The Director calmed down and thought about her suggestion before looking back at her. It was a pretty good idea. “Alright, Mr Zhao will be in A City for a few days. I’ll give the two of you the contact details of Mr Zhao’s assistant. Make an appointment with him.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, a knock was heard on the half-opened door to the office.</p>
 <p>“Enter!”</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Director,” After receiving permission to enter, a slender silhouette appeared before the three of them.</p>
 <p>“Mr… Mr Zhao? Is something the matter? Rest… rest assured about these two students, I’ll definitely teach them a good lesson!”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning flashed a kind and gentle smile at the Director. “You don’t need to be so harsh on them, Director. Actually, one of them is my friend, and the reason why I agreed to give a lecture here was because of her. So, you don’t have to worry about what happened just now,” Zhao Chengning said as he used his chin to point towards Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>Huajuan and the Director’s jaws dropped to the floor.</p>
 <p><i>What the f*ck? What’s going on?!</i></p>
 <p><i>Wait, he did remember something about Shen Jingbin having an impressive background. Did that mean...</i></p>
 <p>The Director turned to look at Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin remained indifferent through it all as she quietly looked at him.</p>
 <p>A cold drop of sweat suddenly rolled down his back.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so it was like that? That makes things easy then since that’s the case. Hahaha…” The Director said with a forced smile. “It’s alright, it’s alright. Mr Zhao, I’m sure you have lots of other important matters to attend to, right? Come, come, the two of you should head back as well. Student Shen, it was my fault just now for not clarifying things and blaming you. Please, accept my apology.”</p>
 <p>How could Shen Jingbin dare to accept the Director’s apology? “It’s alright, Director. This was partly my fault as well, you don’t need to apologise,” Shen Jingbin hastily replied.</p>
 <p>Huajuan was completely dumbfounded by this development and by the time she had regained her senses, it was to hear the Director’s apology. “Then… do I still need to write my self-reflection, Director?” Huajuan said in an attempt to weasel her way out.</p>
 <p>The Director waved his hand. “You don’t need to. You guys should go… Are you leaving as well, Mr Zhao? Please take care then.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning gave his thanks and led Shen Jingbin and Huajuan out of the office.</p>
 <p>“Jingjing, I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll be going on ahead. Bye-bye,” Huajuan said.</p>
 <p>After exiting the office, Huajuan looked back and forth between Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin, before she wisely decided to leave.</p>
 <p>A moment later, only Zhao Chengning and Shen Jingbin were left.</p>
