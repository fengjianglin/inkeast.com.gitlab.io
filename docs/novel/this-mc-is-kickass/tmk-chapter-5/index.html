 <p><b>Chapter 5: Pie From The Heavens</b></p>
 <p><span style>With the good fortune granted to her by her Luck stat, it took Shen Jingbin but a moment to complete her quest. She threw all of the rabbits she caught into her backpack and hurried back to the novice village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she reached the Village Chief’s house, there just so happened to be a few new players receiving their novice rewards. When they turned their heads to look at her, they were so startled by her appearance that their legs felt weak and they nearly sank to their knees in front of the Village Chief. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone quietly cursed, “F*ck, she’s definitely a special kind of ugly. She’s so ugly she’s practically setting a new standard for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin glanced at the player who cursed her without saying a word. After which, she silently walked to the side and sat on a chair. The Village Chief still had an unfathomable look on his face. When she came in, he cast a sidelong glance at her before returning his attention to the players in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he was a competent NPC that carried out his tasks well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While sitting on the chair, Shen Jingbin heard the Village Chief gloomily reciting his script to the players. However, she had a feeling that his words were delivered a little faster than usual, breaking the unique aura of a mysterious expert that he previously exuded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this might all just be in her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, the Village Chief finished his speech and sent off the new players. The player who quietly cursed Shen Jingbin had his novice reward revoked, which led to him ruthlessly spitting in front of her as he walked past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin wondered if there was something wrong with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the new players departed, without waiting for him to speak, Shen Jingbin took out the rabbits and passed them over to the Village Chief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Village Chief wore an expression that seemed to say “this child can be taught” as he looked at her and said, “Sure enough, heroes are born from youths. Consider this time as me owing you a favor. If the day I fully recover and return to the Swordmaster Pavilion comes, I’ll prepare another meager gift to return the kindness that you’ve shown me today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin waved her hand and replied, “There’s no need for you to do such a thing, you recovering is enough for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several rabbits turned into a streak of white light and disappeared into the Village Chief’s palm. He looked up at her and said, “Take out the wooden recommendation plaque that I gave you before .”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Shen Jingbin eyed him suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That plaque is far too ordinary, I’ll give you a new one. With your level of Luck, it’ll be the good fortune of any sect you enter. I’ll have to inform the disciples of the reception hall first. At the same time, I know it’s selfish of me to ask, but I’d like you to join the Swordmaster Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yeah right, I wanna be a Daoist nun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin silently rebuked him while she obediently exchanged her wooden recommendation plaque for a brand new one.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>This new wooden plaque in her hands looked about the same as the previous one, but it included several additional white cloud patterns. There was also some traditional Chinese characters carved in the lower left hand corner of the plaque. On closer inspection, she could make out the words “Bai Hua” <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> inscribed on it.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost as if he could read her mind, Bai Hua spoke up, “Bai Hua is my name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin cautiously placed the wooden plaque into her storage pouch and said, “Thank you Village Chief, I hope you get well soon. I’ll be taking my leave first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Hua nodded his head and replied, “The road ahead is filled with peril and countless hidden dangers. I can’t give you much help now. At present, I can only give you some life saving items. You should take good care of yourself for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finishing what he wanted to say, without waiting for Shen Jingbin to reply, several white streaks of light flashed out from his body. “Ding”, the sound of the system’s notification rang out once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on completing the quest ‘Worries of the Evening Sun Village’s Chief’. Quest reward: Bai Hua’s wooden recommendation plaque (1), Silver Moon Silk Robe (1), Silver Moon Silk Belt (1), Silver Moon Silk Shoes (1), 5,000,000 Experience, 50 taels of silver, and 2,000 Chivalric Prestige. Evening Sun Village Chief’s Goodwill towards you has increased by 80 points, the Goodwill of all NPCs in Evening Sun Village has increased by 50 points.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Notification: As you have collected the full Silver Moon Silk set, all of its hidden attributes have been activated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Notification: As you have passed level 15, please head towards River City to enter a sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the f*ck, there was equipment with hidden attributes?! After hearing the system’s notification, Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but raise her eyebrows — eyebrows that were so sparse they could be disregarded as eyebrows — and opened her storage pouch. She took out the equipment she received as a reward from the Village Chief and started to inspect them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silver Moon Silk Robe, made by a Grandmaster Tailor, Rarity: Purple. Able to grow, Durability 50/50, Physical Strength +5, Inner Strength +5, Speed +3, hidden attribute: Charm +4, chance to root enemies (passive).”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silver Moon Silk Belt, made by a Grandmaster Tailor, Rarity: Purple. Able to grow, Durability 50/50, Physical Strength +1, Inner Strength +1, Speed +1, hidden attribute: consumption of player’s Inner Strength decreased by 1% (passive).”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silver Moon Silk Pants, made by a Grandmaster Tailor, Rarity: Purple. Able to grow, Durability 25/25, Physical Strength +1, Inner Strength +1, Speed +1, hidden attribute: reduces player’s Casting Time by 2% (passive).”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silver Moon Silk Shoes, made by a Grandmaster Tailor, Rarity: Purple. Able to grow, Durability 30/30, Physical Strength +2, Inner Strength +2, Speed +5, hidden attribute: player’s Speed increased by 3% (passive).”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What does “pie falling from the heavens” mean?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It means this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on her many years of gaming experience, the rewards given by this quest were definitely top tier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Putting aside the fact that a set of growing equipment was extremely valuable, just the Experience she received that boosted her straight to level 18 was generous enough. On top of that, the increase in Goodwill she received meant that the chances of her receiving a better quest from the NPCs in Evening Sun Village were greatly increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was overjoyed as she swapped out her novice equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin immediately looked completely different after she changed her equipment. Although she still looked ugly, the equipment helped her carry herself just a little bit better. After all, clothes make the man.</span></p>
