 <p><b>Chapter 250: My Wife Eloped With Someone Else (2)</b></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin and Pure Crane felt the attention of everyone in the tavern shift to them when they sat down at Marco Polo Bun’s table.</p>
 <p>“I wasn't looked at by a single girl before you guys came. Now that you’re here, the entire tavern is looking my way. This is truly terrifying,” Marco Polo Bun said as he poured a cup of tea for each of them.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin glared at him. “Don't spout nonsense.”</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun shrunk back. “What did I do this time?”</p>
 <p>“Do you still have the Floating Light Silk that we got last time when we defeated the Universal Envoy?”</p>
 <p>“The Floating Light Silk? Oh that, it’s in my warehouse. Why? You guys need it? I've looked into it previously, but couldn't figure out what it’s used for. No one in the guild knows either, so I threw it into my warehouse.”</p>
 <p>“Sell it to us then; we need it.”</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun stopped drinking for a moment when he heard what she said. “Mm? You guys need it for a quest?”</p>
 <p>“Mhmm. More specifically, we have a quest that requires the Floating Light Silk,” Pure Crane replied.</p>
 <p>“Ah, then I'll get it from my warehouse and give it to you guys in a bit; free of charge. I don't have any use for it anyway.”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane thought that just taking it for free like that was a little inappropriate. Just as he was about to reject the offer, Shen Jingbin unexpectedly replied, “That’s great, we didn't bring much money with us either.”</p>
 <p>“... No wait, don’t you feel embarrassed just taking it from me like that?!”</p>
 <p>“Not one bit.”</p>
 <p>“Bandit!”</p>
 <p>“Thanks!”</p>
 <p>“Why did Jade Sea Pavilion even take in a bandit like you? Don’t you know that you're smearing the reputation of the number one guild in the game?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave him a look of shock. “Eh, don’t you know? I've already left Jade Sea Pavilion.”</p>
 <p>“The f*ck? You left Jade Sea Pavilion?! Then where are you going to join now?!” Unable to control himself, Marco Polo Bun yelled in astonishment. Silence engulfed the entire tavern for the next few seconds.</p>
 <p>After the few seconds of mysterious silence, a headache-inducing wave of whispered commotion exploded. Listening in on them, Shen Jingbin realised that the word uttered the most often was ‘what the f*c’.</p>
 <p>Unaccustomed to such a noisy environment, Pure Crane said, “Let's find somewhere else. There’s too many people here and it’s noisy.”</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun looked around and agreed. “Then let's go to my manor, I can pass you guys the Floating Light Silk at the same time.”</p>
 <p>After a player’s prestige points reached a certain level, they could pay a sum of money to obtain their own manor. The functions manors provided were dependent on the sum of money and prestige paid, but all manors could function as warehouses. They were set up so that only the owner and friends that they’d given permission to could enter the manor.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin had thought of getting a manor for herself in the past, but she’d dismissed the idea when she’d realised how expensive it was. Quiet And Steadfast had mentioned wanting to give her a mansion too, but she’d rejected it.</p>
 <p>As for that fella Shen Jingchen, heh, he’d probably rather die than pay for a manor.</p>
 <p>The three of them left Fairy Tavern and made their way towards Marco Polo Bun’s manor. Once there, Marco Polo Bun didn’t waste time spouting nonsense and handed them the Floating Light Silk. He then said, “It’s all here. See whether there’s enough. Otherwise, you’ll have to farm more of it yourselves.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you,” Pure Crane said.</p>
 <p>“No problem. Eh, but are you really no longer part of Jade Sea Pavilion? If you don't have anywhere to go, then join our guild. We won’t mind even if you’re a little ugly.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin glanced at him in disdain. “Heh, you're overthinking things; I've already joined a guild. I'm in Pure Crane’s guild now, so worry not.”</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun immediately looked as if he’d just discovered a huge secret and asked in disbelief, “F*ck, don’t tell me there’s really something going on between the two of you?!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin really felt like punching him.</p>
 <p>Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, Pure Crane explained, “No, you're definitely overthinking things. The reason she joined my guild was to make it easier for her to complete quests.”</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun relaxed when he heard Pure Crane’s reply. “So it's like that. Good lord, I was afraid I’d be silenced after finding out something I shouldn't have.”</p>
 <p>“... You’ve watched too many shows,” Shen Jingbin remarked.</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun harrumphed like a&nbsp;<i>tsundere&nbsp;</i>and said, “That’s none of your business.”</p>
