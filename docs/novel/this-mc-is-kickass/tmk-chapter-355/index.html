 <p><b>Chapter 355: The Award Ceremony (1)</b></p>
 <p>“As everybody knows, the main reason behind organising this offline event is to share exclusive news with our players. But, apart from that, we have one other important objective: to distribute awards to the top players on the various leaderboards. Thanks to the efforts of all the players here and the players who are watching this live broadcast, &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; has achieved remarkable results since it began service. To repay you all for the love and support you’ve shown towards our company, we’ve prepared lots of exciting prizes for you!” The only female amongst the three organisers took over from the hostess, wanting to liven up the atmosphere. However, she didn’t manage to achieve her intended effect, so she was left awkwardly standing there.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Xiang Peng sighed and stepped forward. “Just like how every school has its own prominent individuals on campus, every game similarly has their own legendary Great Masters. Be it everybody who is present here or everybody who is watching the live broadcast right now; I’m sure all of you must be very interested in finding out what the Great Masters look like in real life. That being the case, I shan’t keep you in suspense any longer and will proceed to the first segment of the award ceremony for today! Let’s give a round of applause and invite the Six Great Sects’ Lead Disciples on stage!”</p>
 <p>The crowd immediately broke out into thunderous applause as soon as his voice died down. Even the comments on the live stream's bullet screen suddenly skyrocketed.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin didn’t expect the event to unfold so quickly and was only able to react after the spotlight had shone on her. By this time, the people beside her had already stood up. Zhao Chengning looked at her and, in a very gentlemanly manner, extended his hand to her. She very naturally placed her hand in his and stood up.</p>
 <p>This little movement of theirs caused a commotion amongst the crowd, and the bullet screen skyrocketed yet again.</p>
 <p>“Is that Great Master Quiet And Steadfast and that Nutjob from White Cloud Temple? Goodness! That’s what they look like?! How terrifying!”</p>
 <p>“What’s a handsome couple? What’s a match made in heaven? This is! This is what it f*cking looks like!”</p>
 <p>“It feels as if I’ve suddenly been forced to face my single lonely existence without any warning. Yet surprisingly, I feel really happy. What’s happening?”</p>
 <p>“Previously, I thought the game’s management was just trying to pacify us when they said that she was a player as well, but it looks like she really is one!”</p>
 <p>“Is Jade Sea Pavilion still recruiting? My skills are ordinary, but I have money! I’ll be your ATM as long as you guys are willing to add me into your guild!”</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Are you having fun? I seem to recall that when the game’s officials posted a clarification back then, you said that ‘this Great Senior Sister is not that Great Senior Sister’. Aren’t you eating your own words now? What a joke.”</p>
 <p>“What happened to the bullet screen just now? I can smell sour grapes even from across the screen.”</p>
 <p>There were both butthurt and idolising comments on the bullet screen for the live broadcast. The atmosphere at the event itself, however, was quite good.</p>
 <p>When Shen Jingbin stepped onto the stage, she was suddenly made aware of the countless looks filled with all sorts of emotions behind them that were directed her way. She couldn’t help but lightly knit her brows together. Zhao Chengning seemed to have sensed the change in her mood as his hand, that was previously holding her own, had moved to wrap itself around her shoulder in a single smooth movement. He then attempted to use the crook of his arm to soothe her nerves.</p>
 <p>“Relax,” he slightly leaned over and spoke into her ear.</p>
 <p>She looked up to glance and him and was met with his eyes that were filled with mirth.</p>
 <p>Normally, after going up on the stage, they’d introduce themselves after being prompted by the host. It might’ve been intentionally done, but Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning were both assigned to stand at the back.</p>
 <p>When it was Shen Jingbin’s turn, the crowd suddenly erupted in cheers and whistles, which mostly came from the males. However, Shen Jingbin acted as if she couldn’t hear any of it and said, “I’m the Lead Disciple of White Cloud Temple, Nutjob.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning followed closely behind. “I’m the Lead Disciple of Lich Palace, Quiet And Steadfast.”</p>
 <p>Now, it was the females’ turn to cheer.</p>
 <p>The hostess hurriedly came out and attempted to get the crowd under control. After the crowd’s enthusiasm died down, the people on stage followed the usual routine ‒ the presenters gave out the awards, while the recipients gave their speeches. Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning were both the conservative type. They just said a few words with indifferent expressions. But, in spite of that, it didn’t detract from their attractiveness. Instead, it served to make the crowd want them even more. While those who were watching the live broadcast left comments on the bullet screens lamenting their inability to travel through the screen and see them in person.</p>
 <p>After the first segment of the award ceremony ended, Shen Jingbin was about to get off the stage with Zhao Chengning when they were unexpectedly called back.</p>
 <p>“Great Senior Sister and Great Master, please remain on stage.”</p>
 <p>Both of them turned back and looked perplexedly at the main organiser who asked them to stay behind. They then looked towards Xiang Peng, who was trying to send them a hint with his eyes.</p>
 <p>Since the hostess wasn’t very sure about the game’s specifics, the main organisers took over from there.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing both of them stop in their tracks, the male organiser who called them back walked to the front of the stage and said to the audience below, “The moment I laid eyes on them, I knew that everyone else would be curious as well. So, I decided to seize the opportunity and exercise a little bit of my authority to hold them back for a chat with everyone. However, before we continue, is everyone familiar with who they are?”</p>
 <p>The people below chorused, “We are!”</p>
 <p>The organiser chuckled in satisfaction and continued, “Actually, I myself play this game as well, so I can understand how all of you are feeling right now... Come, come, Great Senior Sister and Great Master, please come to the centre of the stage. I see that the two of you are rather close to each other; the fact that both of you are husband and wife in the game is also widely known by everyone here. I have a question I’d like to ask; may I?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin really wanted to say ‘no’, but that didn’t seem very polite. So, she just nodded.</p>
 <p>The organizer then turned his attention to Zhao Chengning and looked inquiringly at him. He waited till Zhao Chengning also nodded before he asked with a laugh, “Are the two of you a couple in real life as well?”</p>
 <p>The crowd broke into an uproar the moment he asked that question.</p>
