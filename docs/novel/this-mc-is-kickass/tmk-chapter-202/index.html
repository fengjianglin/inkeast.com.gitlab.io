 <p><b>Chapter 202: Battle For The Title Of City Lord (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>“I’m just joking. Seriously speaking, my guild's adopting a neutral position and won’t be able to help you. However, my Leader dislikes both Sovereign’s Descent and Life&nbsp;At&nbsp;First Sight, so he’s told me to hand the Vajra Possession Elixir over to you.”</p>
 <p>“The one that gives you invulnerability for thirty seconds after consuming it?”</p>
 <p>“Mm.”</p>
 <p>“That’s great! Give it to me!’</p>
 <p>“F*ck! Why can’t you be more modest and reject it first?!”</p>
 <p>“I’m not an idiot, why would I reject it out of modesty? If you guys weren’t sincere about giving it to me, wouldn’t&nbsp;saying&nbsp;this be giving you guys an opportunity to renege on what you said? I definitely won’t give you guys the chance to do that.”</p>
 <p>“... You really are a bandit!”</p>
 <p>“You’re too kind.”</p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun was feeling depressed now.&nbsp;<i>No one was complimenting you!</i></p>
 <p>Marco Polo Bun had withdrawn three Vajra Possession Elixirs from the guild’s warehouse. The act of doing so made him feel like his heart was bleeding out. He’d expended so much energy just to concoct these elixirs, and yet he was giving it to this female bandit just like that.</p>
 <p><i>Ah, the pain was unbearable.</i></p>
 <p>Morally Grey, who was beside Marco Polo Bun, felt similarly pained by this. But, as the saying goes, no pain; no gain! He still hadn’t paid Sovereign’s Descent back for their previous trickery, and Jade Sea Pavilion was the perfect tool to take care of them. When he thought of it that way, it made the loss of those elixirs more bearable.</p>
 <p>When Shen Jingbin joined back up with the rest of the members from Jade Sea Pavilion and made their way towards Underworld City, she received a package from Marco Polo Bun. To make things more convenient for players, the postal service in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; offered long-distance trading services. However, said service didn’t come cheap.</p>
 <p>“What’s that?” Everyone saw a carrier pigeon flying over with a small wooden box in its beak. Tanabata Evening was the first of the curious onlookers to crowd around Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>“It’s a life-saving elixir that someone else gave me,” Shen Jingbin replied.</p>
 <p>After saying so, she opened the wooden box, and three rays of golden light shot out from within.</p>
 <p>“F*ck, what kind of elixir is that? It looks so cool!” Said her party member, Descent Of Rain And Snow, who sighed in admiration.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin, whose eyes were dazzled by the golden light, hurriedly shut the lid and said, “It’s the Vajra Possession Elixir.”</p>
 <p>Everyone within the party&nbsp;stared&nbsp;at her in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Give me a moment; I’m going to go give this to Quiet And Steadfast.”</p>
 <p>She then jogged off towards Quiet And Steadfast.</p>
 <p>Everyone from Jade Sea Pavilion who wasn’t a Life Skill player was now gathered in front of Underworld City. Although there were only several dozens of them, the imposing aura they gave off was astonishing. And, as the Leader of the guild, Quiet&nbsp;And&nbsp;Steadfast was standing tall at the forefront of the guild.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen was the first to spot Shen Jingbin running over. When she got a little nearer, he knitted his brows and said, “Eh? Why are you here Little Jing? Hurry on back to your party.”</p>
 <p>Hearing what Shen Jingchen had said, everyone in Quiet And Steadfast’s team of elites turned around to face her. The ones who didn’t usually play together with her visibly frowned and looked a little unhappy.</p>
 <p>Because they didn’t know her that well, they all thought that she was one of those self-entitled women who enjoyed abusing their undeserving status to order people around.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin acted as if she hadn’t seen them, while also ignoring her brother, and walked straight up to Quiet And Steadfast’s side.</p>
 <p>She cast a glance a Quiet And Steadfast; at least he wasn’t put off by her presence.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin presented the small wooden box in her hands to him and said, “This is for you. Marco Polo Bun just sent a package to me containing some Vajra Possession Elixirs. There’s not much point in me holding onto them, so I’ll let you have them instead.”</p>
 <p>When she said that, a look of surprise flashed across the faces of the players who were previously dissatisfied with her.</p>
 <p>Of&nbsp;course&nbsp;they knew what a Vajra Possession Elixir was!</p>
 <p>A small look of surprise&nbsp;coloured&nbsp;Quiet And Steadfast’s face for a moment too before he took the box from her. He opened the box and observed its contents for a moment before he asked, “Vajra Possession Elixir? Was this a gift from Memelord?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded her head.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s gaze went downwards, and his eyes glittered. “Thank you... and take care of yourself later.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded her head again before she made her way back to her party.</p>
 <p>Looking at the retreating figure that had to break into a jog because of her stubby legs, Shen Jingchen couldn’t help but tsk and say, “Sigh, she really is a piece of work. She gave such a valuable item to you without any hesitation, yet she didn’t even stop to spare a thought for her older brother. She really needs to be&nbsp;married&nbsp;out ASAP.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast cast a sidelong glance at him and said, “If it were me, I wouldn’t spare a thought for a brother like you either.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen: ...</p>
 <p>At this moment, Underworld City’s tightly shut gates suddenly began to creak open. It looked as if the solemn and stately gates were slowly being pulled open by a mysterious force.</p>
 <p>“It’s begun,” Quiet And Steadfast turned his attention to the slowly opening city gates.</p>
 <p>“Mm,” Replied everyone else as they reigned in the frivolous expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin, who was standing in the crowd and watching the city gates slowly open, felt an indescribable wave of excitement wash over her. It was as if she were attending her very first competition all over again. She looked around and found that everyone’s gaze was locked to the front, a shared purpose binding all of them together.</p>
 <p>[System Announcement] Every era has its talents; player Dawn’s Twilight has challenged the current City Lord of Underworld City, Lonely Moon, to a duel. The battle for the title of City Lord will begin in ten minutes.</p>
