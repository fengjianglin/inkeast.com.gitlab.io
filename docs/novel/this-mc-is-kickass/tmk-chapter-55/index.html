 <p>Wonderful news!<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bone Painting Coroner&nbsp;</span></strong>is back!!!

 <p><strong>Chapter 55: Marriage (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Life At First Sight and Jade Sea Pavilion were always at loggerheads was something everyone in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; knew about. Furthermore, the relationship between the two Guild Leaders was no secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Quiet And Steadfast were to get married, and Crying Fish did not appear to wreck the ceremony, everyone present would definitely say that it’s illogical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully, the world still ran on logic. As expected, Crying Fish had indeed appeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few bright and dazzling Realm Announcements swept across the server, causing all players to erupt with gossip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two girls were fighting over a man! Furthermore, it was a cat fight between a beauty and an ugly girl!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, the realm of the gods and goddesses was truly interesting!</span></p>
 <p>The surrounding audience, as well as the people from Jade Sea Pavilion, were all bubbling in excitement.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Next Week Is Unlikely: What the f*ck, what’s going on!? Quiet, why are you getting married without even giving us a heads up?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: Quiet And Steadfast, you motherf*cker! Why’d you abduct my sister without even saying a word to me! I’m your Brother-in-law, your Brother-in-law, your Brother-in-law here! Ehh, I should be called the Brother-in-law, right?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Little Monk: Dawn, aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing here?!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: Ah, sorry, I got a little confused! Nutjob, get over here right now! Why didn’t you discuss something as important as your marriage with me first! Just who am I to you? Do think you can act like a nutjob just because that’s your name?!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Slight Chill: ...He’s actually getting married?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eight National Treasures: What the f*ck!? Our Leader, whom I’ve always believed would remain single for the rest of his life, is getting married! He’s getting married! He’s getting married!</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Not A Monster: Even our Leader is getting married, will it be my lil sis’ turn soon? (*/。＼)</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Really Not A Monster: Even Nutjob has a suitor, will my Mr. Right be coming soon? (*/。＼)</p>
 <p>[Guild] Actually, I Am A Monster: These two must be really crazy.</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m A Monster, Dare To Hit Me: The idiot upstairs has finally said something sensible for once.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: Quarrelsome Fish must be going crazy right now.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Faint Blue Seaweed: She’s already batshit insane, just look at the Realm Announcements.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eternal Rest: Tsk tsk tsk, what a model jilted lover. Those who don’t know might really think that she and our Leader were a couple in the past.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Syrup Time: Eh, Quarrelsome Fish is threatening people once again!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: F*CK! Since this Quarrelsome Fish actually dared to threaten my little sister, this brother of hers will go off on that Quarrelsome Fish!</p>
 <p>Dawn’s Twilight’s words had just appeared when the comrades from Jade Sea Pavilion saw their Leader’s tyrannical declaration.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Stay your hands, she’s mine.</p>
 <p>Everyone: <i>Oh. My. God! Leader, why are you so charming!</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin sat on the horse’s back, and due to the system’s decision that the girl should be in front of the guy when they shared a mount, it looked like she was nestled in Quiet And Steadfast’s embrace.</p>
 <p>She had seen Crying Fish’s Realm Announcements, but she didn’t take any of them to heart. “Actually, you can just ignore her. I don’t think she’d be able to beat me even if we fought.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast looked into the distance while holding onto the reins and said, “No matter what, I still need to make an appearance.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin spoke no further.</p>
 <p>He was right, he did have to make an appearance in times like these.</p>
 <p>Anything belonging to Quiet And Steadfast was of the best quality. Even this white steed they rode on was an excellent mount, so it didn't take long for the duo to reach Matchmaker's Shrine. Due to the ruckus and the Realm Announcements, Matchmaker's Shrine had long since been filled with innumerable people who were there for the show.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave a sweeping glance and actually spotted a few familiar faces.</p>
 <p>Everyone who’d been seen by her couldn’t help but put a hand to their eyes and weep.</p>
 <p>God, was there something on your mind when you decided to marry her?! Don’t you know that as long as you’re willing, there’d be thousands of girls for you to choose from?!</p>
 <p>After managing to squeeze themselves into Matchmaker's Shrine with great difficulty, they felt the numerous gazes that were on them cut off by the closing of the temple’s doors. Only then did Shen Jingbin heave a sigh of relief. She casually opened up the guild channel and the amount of text that flew by gave rise to a dull ache in her head.</p>
 <p>Rubbing the centre of her brows, she enquired, “Are we not going to inform the guild about this?”</p>
 <p>“Hold on, I was just about to let them know.”</p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: To all members who are online: if you’re free or interested, party up and attend my wedding. Party 1’s leader is me, Party 2’s is Next Week, Party 3’s is Dawn, and Party 4’s is Seaweed. Invitations will be handed out in the parties, go to the next one if the party is full.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Temperate Scarlet Moon: 1111111111 don’t fight with me! I’m going to Party 1!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Tanabata Evening: I don’t care which party I join, just give me a spot!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Long Life: I’ll join whichever party my wife joins! ( ˘ ³˘)♥</p>
 <p>[Guild] Gentle Flower: F*ck, can the two of you not flirt right now?!</p>
 <p>Next Week Is Unlikely, Shen Jingchen, and Seaweed, soon arrived at the Matchmaker's Shrine. Quiet And Steadfast traded invitations to the trio before he joined them in front of the temple, and there they then waited for the arrival of their guild members.</p>
 <p>Since one required an invitation to enter Matchmaker's Shrine, the temple had already been densely surrounded with players by the time guild members from Jade Sea Pavilion finally arrived. It took them a great deal of time and effort to make it through the human wall.</p>
 <p>After ensuring all guild members had received their invitation, Quiet And Steadfast waved his hand and led his grandiose procession inside to proceed with the ceremony.</p>
