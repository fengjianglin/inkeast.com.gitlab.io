 <p><b>Chapter 108: The Young Girl’s Schemes (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin didn’t see the Shen siblings for the entire afternoon. She was under the impression that they were gone for class till it was dinner time and she saw the duo discussing something as they were walking down the staircase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin was standing at the kitchen’s entrance with dishes in hand when she saw the siblings. She looked back to her Mother in surprise and asked, “Eh? Aren’t Big Brother Shen and Big Sis Shen students? Why don’t they have to go to class?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like they’ve gotten enough course credits or something like that… Sigh, I don’t know anything about what’s going on in their university. Anyway, I know they’re both outstanding individuals who don’t need to go to school… Xinxin, I’ll be able to wake up with a smile on my face if you can carve out a future that’s as promising as those two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How annoying! Why’re you dragging me into this?” Qu Yanxin said as she wrinkled her nose in displeasure. Turning around, her line of sight fell on Shen Jingchen and her eyes automatically lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two siblings were sitting at the dining table and talking about the game when Shen Jingchen suddenly felt an intense gaze on him and he unconsciously shivered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Shen Jingbin asked, “What’s wrong with you? Are you having an epileptic fit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. I just suddenly felt a surge of malice that automatically activated the warning mechanism in my body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Rumpus youth, you’re way too old to be suffering from </span><i><span style>chuunibyou</span></i><span style>, alright[1. For the rare few of you who don’t know what </span><i><span style>chuunibyou </span></i><span style>means :P http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chuunibyou]?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, I can’t even crack a joke. Why’re you so boring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m boring? Then you better go and find a more interesting person to sit with. Don’t sit next to me,” Shen Jingbin ruthlessly countered as she rolled her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s face fell. He was just about to explain the theory behind “the eldest taking the role of the father” so that she’d learn to show her big bro some respect when he was suddenly interrupted by someone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Shen, what’re you guys talking about? It looks very interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duo heard a voice and turned around. The one who’d asked the question with an innocent smile on her face was Qu Yanxin. She was holding a dish in her hands as she stood behind the siblings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing, we were just talking about a game,” Shen Jingchen said as he shifted to the side, making it easier for her to set the dish on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After placing the dish on the table, Qu Yanxin straightened herself and asked, “What game? Is it fun? Can I play with you guys?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s eyebrows knitted together a little, and he was no longer wearing the frivolous smile he had on his face just moments before. Yet, this just made Qu Yanxin’s heart skip a beat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re in your final year of high school. Focus on your studies. Games don’t suit you,” Came Shen Jingchen’s incomparably stern reply. Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but do a double take upon hearing it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tsk, tsk, tsk! Someone like you actually knows how to say something like that. How horrifying.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bah! Your elder brother is actually the pillar of our motherland, alright?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re more or less the termite that wrecks those pillars!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The siblings started communicating telepathically. At this moment, Aunt Zhang walked out from the kitchen. When she saw that her daughter was still standing behind the Shen siblings, she couldn’t help but comment with a strange look on her face, “Xinxin, what’re you doing just standing there? Quickly, get back to your seat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin muttered under her breath and took another glance at the duo who were currently communicating telepathically. An enigmatic expression crossed her face as she ran back to her seat. Shen Jingchen was a carnivore and wouldn’t be happy without meat. Qu Yanxin noticed this when they were eating lunch in the afternoon. Hence, it was unknown whether she did it on purpose or not, but she would always go after the same piece of meat as he did during their meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time Shen Jingchen raised his head to look at her, she’d wear an embarrassed look on her face and give up on the meat that she was after. After which, her gaze would swiftly move towards her bowl of rice and she’d take a huge mouthful of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys have the same tastes in food,” Shen Jingbin commented as she eyed them curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That can’t be. This child would always make a fuss about wanting to lose weight in the past and refused to eat even a slice of meat. I reckon she wanted to eat some meat because she’s been worrying about the competition for the past two days,” Aunt Zhang hurriedly explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen felt embarrassed about having to fight with a little girl over food. He’d be the first one to give up whenever he went for the same dish that she did. As a result, both would end up giving up on the very piece of meat that caused the fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin took the piece of meat and placed it in Qu Yanxin’s bowl before she said, “Since that’s the case, you better eat more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin quietly raised her head and glanced at Shen Jingbin who was in front of her. For some strange reason, Shen Jingbin’s heart suddenly tightened when she saw the dull, lifeless look in the other party’s eyes, causing feelings of guilt to arise from the bottom of her heart with a thud. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, thank you Big Sis Shen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, the meal continued on without incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aunt Zhang wanted to take her daughter and the siblings for a walk after dinner, so the siblings sat on the sofa and waited for her to finish tidying up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked at Qu Yanxin’s back as she helped her Mother around the kitchen and said to Shen Jingchen, “Why do I think that this little girl isn’t as simple as she appears to be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s eyes went wide as he looked at her and exclaimed, “I think so too!”</span></p>
