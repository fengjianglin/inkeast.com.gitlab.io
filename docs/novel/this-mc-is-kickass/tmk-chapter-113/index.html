 <p><b>Chapter 113: Returning To School (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin felt that Zhao Chengning had to be Cao Cao’s reincarnation. She’d only just thought of him when she received a call from the person in question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the words “Zhao Chengning” on the phone’s screen, she suddenly felt a little reluctant to answer the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this? Is a friend of yours calling?” Aunt Zhang glanced at her phone and smiled. “You best answer the phone then, lest the other person hangs up. I’ll go check on the two kids over there,” Saying that, she hurried over to catch up to the duo in front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin helplessly looked at Aunt Zhang’s departing figure before she glanced down at her phone, and then taking a deep breath, she answered the called.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you outside?” Zhao Chengning could pick up the sound of car horns on the other end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I’m taking a walk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you lead such a healthy lifestyle,” Zhao Chengning commented with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you go out for a walk after meals?” Shen Jingbin asked in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Work is tiring enough for me, I’m too tired for walks after that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going to grow a belly at this rate,” Shen Jingbin cursed with evil intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning softly chuckled, “I won’t. Even though I don’t go for walks, I make sure to work out every day. My eight-pack abdominals are all here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch,” Shen Jingbin clicked her tongue. </span><i><span style>You don’t have the energy for walks, yet you’re still energetic enough to work out. As expected, men only know how to deceive others with their words!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, do you want to know the continuation of what happened on Weibo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of continuation?” Shen Jingbin hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I happened to meet that classmate of mine today, and Chenyi was around when he asked me that question… Do you remember Chenyi, the lady Boss of Blooming Flower Pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I remember her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had originally intended on playing dumb and acting as if I didn’t know you, but Chenyi’s expression gave it away when she saw your photo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After that, I sent Xuya out as a distraction and slipped away,” He responded, not a shred of remorse heard from his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin could almost see the expression on Xuya’s face as he was sent out. “He let you do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, because I promised to help him with something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin’s curiosity was piqued. “What kind of thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning however, left her hanging. “I’m not telling you for now. You’ll know when the time is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does it have something to do with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it does.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin fell into a stunned silence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It's related to me? Why would it have something to do with me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Due to being lost in her own thoughts, she didn’t notice that Shen Jingchen had sneakily returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, who’s calling you? Just look at that silly grin of yours!” Shen Jingchen jumped out from behind her and gave her a pat on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A silly grin? You must be joking! Shen Jingbin’s face turned solemn in a split second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that Shen Jingbin’s expressionless face had turned colder, Shen Jingchen roared with laughter, “I was just pulling your leg and you actually believed me! That paralyzed face of yours lacks the ability to grin like that,” After laughing for a while, he continued, “Is that how you behave when you’re feeling guilty? Who on earth is on the other side of the call? Hm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning could clearly hear Shen Jingchen’s loud voice over the other side of the phone speaking to Shen Jingbin. “Pass the phone to your brother, I need to have a few words with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin handed the phone to Shen Jingchen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look horrible when you laugh, like your jaw’s about to fall off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen looked at the phone that she handed over and was stunned. His eyes darted back and forth between the phone and his sister. “Y-you’re having a conversation with your lover and you even dare to let me speak with him? Oh baby, are you trying to intimidate me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin rolled her eyes at him. “I think you need to see a doctor so that they can take a look at your brain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen shrugged. “Your brother is a genius, normal people like you would never understand me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really felt like smashing her phone into that face of his!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God damn retard,” Shen Jingbin stuffed the phone into his hands and stormed away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk tsk tsk, how hot-tempered,” Shen Jingchen sighed as he looked at his sister depart, the phone in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he was done lamenting, he lowered his gaze and eyed the phone. The words “Zhao Chengning” burning into his retinas.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my, it's my future Brother-in-law</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes flashing with light, Shen Jingchen placed the phone next to his ear and said, “Ah Ning...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that Aunt Zhang and her daughter were waiting for her in front, Shen Jingbin hurriedly walked towards the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Shen, who is Big Brother Shen speaking to? He’s laughing so happily,” Qu Yanxin immediately asked upon noticing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin turned to peek at Shen Jingchen, and like Qu Yanxin said, he was currently laughing his head off. No semblance of the indifferent adonis remained, attracting the gazes of numerous girls and aunties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of friend? A girlfriend? Big Brother Shen looks completely different from before,” Qu Yanxin asked once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Aunt Zhang rapped her daughter’s head. “Is who calls him any of your business? Is this something you can ask?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin held her head and grumbled, “I was just curious because Big Brother Shen looks like a completely different person now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So are you trying to say that he has to report to you about whoever he talks to, and what friends he has?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom!” Qu Yanxin suddenly raised her voice and interrupted her Mother before she turned to look at Shen Jingbin, an awkward expression on her face. “Big Sister Shen, don’t listen to my Mother’s nonsense. I was just curious, I don’t have any other intentions.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if I did have any, now wasn’t the right time to show it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright,” Shen Jingbin played dumb and acted as though she hadn’t heard anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few minutes later, Shen Jingchen hung up and jogged over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been on the phone for a really long time, what were you talking about?” Shen Jingbin retrieved her phone and suspiciously eyed her brother who was all smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing Qu Yanxin on the side, her eyes brimming with curiosity, Shen Jingchen reined in the expression on his face and replaced it with a look of seriousness and replied, “It’s nothing, this is between us, you don’t need to know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin’s lips curled and she shot him a look of disdain. “Why don’t you just die already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen glared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin, who’d been ignored, saw that the siblings had an ordinary but good relationship with each other. Due to this, she couldn’t help but feel jealous of Shen Jingbin when she recalled how distant Shen Jingchen seemed to be when she was with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group continued strolling around the park for a bit before they then returned home.</span></p>
