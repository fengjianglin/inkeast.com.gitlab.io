 <p><b>Chapter 114: Returning To School (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>As there were guests in the house, both siblings felt that it would be inappropriate for them to be playing games. Therefore, after washing up, the siblings went to bed after chatting with their friends and watching TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin’s first competition began at nine in the morning, thus the siblings had to wake up early. However, Shen Jingchen was in a foul mood from having to wake up so early; he grumbled the entire time they spent walking to the garage and getting the car started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You could have just gone by yourself, why the hell do I have to tag along?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin opened the car door, easing herself into the driver's seat while answering, “It doesn’t sit right with me, you sleeping in bed while I have to wake up so early to drive someone to school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen sat beside her and fastened his seatbelt. When he heard his sister’s reply, he almost flipped. “You’re petty! So petty! Oh my god! Why did I have a sister like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin looked at him coldly. “Why don’t you ask Mom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen recalled the regal atmosphere given off by their Mother and immediately gave up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even cowering takes skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, forget it. Your brother is magnanimous! I’ll bear with you being such a petty person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch, yeah. Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin couldn’t be bothered with him. She turned the steering wheel and beautifully slid the black Porsche out of the garage, to where Qu Yanxin was already waiting for them by the entrance of the house. When the car stopped in front of her, she looked over the car several times before hopping into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, Big Sister Shen knows how to drive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin gave an indifferent “Mm.” in response to her question. Qu Yanxin looked over to glance at Shen Jingchen who was asleep beside his sister. “What’s wrong with Big Brother Shen? Is he not feeling well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright, he’s just sleepy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yanxin returned to her seat with a remorseful look on her face. “Actually, Big Sister and Big Brother didn’t have to send me, this is so embarrassing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Shen Jingbin glanced towards the rearview mirror. Although the girl reflected in it had a remorseful look on her face, she couldn’t hide the smug look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin retracted her gaze and didn’t speak further.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Girl, the reason why we’re together is because I can’t stand the idea of letting him sleep in by himself, don’t overthink things.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Probably because Shen Jingchen was asleep, Qu Yanxin didn’t go out of her way to start a conversation with Shen Jingbin, which she was quite happy with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so, the two traveled in silence till they reached First High.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Shen Jingchen awoke, Qu Yanxin had already left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did she go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was slouched over the steering wheel, engrossed in her mobile game. After hearing her brother’s voice, she straightened her back and replied, “She left for the exam. It’d be the end of her if she slept in like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch, when's she gonna finish?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally an exam would take two hours, so I guess it’d be around… 11am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, what do we do while we wait?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shook her head. “I don’t know either. I was waiting for you to wake up and give suggestions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...You win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and tell me what we’re going to do to pass the time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking for a bit, Shen Jingchen said, “Do you want to go back to school and look around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A University was only around 10 minutes away from First High, so after thinking about it, Shen Jingbin felt that it was a feasible idea. Once she had made sure that Shen Jingchen was sitting properly, she started the car and headed for A University with a magnificent drift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the car stopped, Shen Jingchen threw open the car door and fled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to look for my guy friends! Call me when you’re about to leave!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tch, he sure was quick on his feet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin glanced at her brother’s disappearing figure before she opened her contact list to search for Xiaohe’s phone number. Dialing her number, Xiaohe took a while before she picked up the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, Jingjing?” Xiaohe said softly, as if she was suppressing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaohe, why’re you speaking so softly?” Shen Jingbin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me a break sister, I’m having lessons right now! It’s Abbess Li’s lessons!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abbess Li’s real name was Li Qing, she was the notorious Abbess Miejue of Management University A. The number of students who fell under her whip were immeasurable each semester, a nightmare for all students in the university.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You poor thing, you’re having classes so early in the morning,” Shen Jingbin could hear Xiaohe’s teeth grind the moment the words left her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pui, you’re a nutjob! I’m going to hang up now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, I’m back at school. I’ll keep you guys company since I’ve got nothing better to do. Which classroom are you guys in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin heard a slight commotion on the other end of the phone, before Xiaohe finally replied, “Go to the First Lecture Building, B201. We’re seated on the left side, close to the rear door.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hanging up, Shen Jingbin stepped forth towards the First Lecture Building.</span></p>
