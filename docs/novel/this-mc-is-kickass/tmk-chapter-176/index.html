 <p><b>Chapter 176: An Unavoidable Encounter With An Enemy (2)&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p>[Guild] Temperate Scarlet Moon: Attention everyone, Shinra Sect disciples have been spotted at Central Luo River. A number of female players from Fluttering Flower Palace have been PKed. Life Skill players, make sure you avoid the Luo River region.</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Not A Monster: They’re at Luo River? Hahaha, let me at them! I’ll go teach them how to act like proper people!</p>
 <p>Shinra Sect Disciples could earn contribution points when they PKed disciples from the Six Great Sect. However, the same was true for disciples of the Six Great Sects and they could net themselves contribution points for PKing Shinra Sect disciples. So, while everyone else was living in fear of the Shinra Sect that appeared and disappeared at random, the beasts from Jade Sea Pavilion were all hyped up.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Tanabata Evening: Are you an idiot? Do you really think they’d still be there even if you rushed over now? You’re better off just staying here like a good boy!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eternal Rest: Sigh. My friends are all retarded, what should I do? Anxiously waiting online for a reply!</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Not A Monster: ...F*ck, get lost!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Quiet And Steadfast said that he would warn you guys to be wary of a player from Sovereign’s Descent named Reckless East Emperor. Has he mentioned anything yet?</p>
 <p>[Guild] National Treasure: !!! Nutty! Long time no see, I miss you!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Syrup Time: Our Mascot’s back! Happy days are here!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Ma’am, are you doubting my ability to get things done?</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin’s eyes widened when she saw a row of words suddenly pop up in the guild channel.</p>
 <p><i>Crap, she forgot to check if he was online!</i></p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Really Not A Monster: Hahahaha! Why does it seem like we’re gonna have a nice show to watch?!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Faint Blue Seaweed: I think the one on top of me is going to get it</p>
 <p>[Guild] Big Buddhist Nun: +1.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Actually, I Am A Monster: I won’t admit to knowing an idiot like him.</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m A Monster, Dare To Hit Me: Same here.</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Really Not A Monster: ...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Next Week Is Unlikely: Ah Ning told us about it. It might have been a coincidence, but we frequently saw him in the past. However, we haven’t seen hide nor hair of him these days.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: Be careful Nutty, you’re the only publicly known Lead Disciple. There are probably lots of people from the Shinra Sect who’re eyeing you.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Mm, I know. I’ll be careful, thanks.</p>
 <p>[Guild]: Long Life: Don’t forget about us if you need any help.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Alright.（＾－＾）</p>
 <p>At that moment, she suddenly received a letter from Pure Crane.</p>
 <p>“Head to Beiwang Mountain, I’ve found the Nymph’s Lead Disciple. Quiet And Steadfast are both here right now.”</p>
 <p>She received a letter from Quiet And Steadfast just after she was done reading Pure Crane’s one. “Come to Beiwang Mountain.”</p>
 <p>After reading both letters, Shen Jingbin immediately summoned Mascot and flew towards Beiwang Mountain.</p>
 <p>Three people could be seen sitting in a pavilion when she landed on the peak of Beiwang Summit.</p>
 <p>In addition to Pure Crane and Quiet And Steadfast, there was one other female player who wore fashionable light yellow clothes and had her back turned towards Shen Jingbin.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt that this person’s silhouette looked kind of familiar.</p>
 <p>“You’re here,” Quiet And Steadfast said as he went to welcome her. After following him into the pavilion, Shen Jingbin managed to get a good look at the female player’s face.</p>
 <p>And stumbled.</p>
 <p>How did that saying go again? That’s right, it was: an unavoidable encounter with an enemy. The Nymph’s Lead Disciple that Pure Crane spoke of was actually Morning Glory Chime!</p>
 <p>“Allow me to introduce her. This girl over here is a member of my guild and her name is Morning Glory Chime. She’s also the Nymph’s Lead Disciple.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Pure Crane, you don’t need to introduce me. We know each other. Isn’t that right, Sister Nutty?” The moment she saw Shen Jingbin, Morning Glory Chime discreetly shot a glare at her before she reverted to her previous warm and gentle facade.</p>
 <p>“You two know each other?” Pure Crane said as he eyed the two of them suspiciously.</p>
 <p>Seeing as his words were directed at Shen Jingbin, she expressionlessly nodded her head in reply.</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime smiled once again. “Sister Nutty and I went dungeoning in the past with her pro guildmates… Oh, I haven’t seen Brother Quiet since that time! I don’t know whether he still remembers me,” She then broke into a bashful smile after she said that.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin felt a chill run down her spine.</p>
 <p>Without even looking at her, Quiet And Steadfast bluntly replied, “I don’t remember.”</p>
 <p>Morning Glory Chime’s bashful look immediately turned into one of embarrassment.</p>
 <p>At this time Pure Crane, who was experienced in dealing with conflicts, stepped in and smoothed things over, “I asked Morning Glory beforehand. Apart from the fact that she’s the Nymph’s Lead Disciple, she hasn’t received any epic grade hidden quests. This time around, I brought her over to get you guys acquainted.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast nodded and said, “If I’m not wrong, the rest of the Lead Disciples probably haven’t received any hidden quests either since we’ve already covered the three categories of players, spirit beasts, and Divine Weapons.”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane grunted in agreement. “That’s what I was thinking too, I just wasn’t sure of it.”</p>
 <p>“How much headway have you guys made with the Divine Weapons?” Shen Jingbin asked.</p>
 <p>“The system’s hint was for me to gather certain materials. I’ve gotten most of them, but I still haven’t found any clues for the last two.”</p>
 <p>“What materials are they?” Quiet And Steadfast asked.</p>
 <p>“Floating Light Silk and Shadow Snaring Water.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin thought back to the drops that Marco Polo Bun had found from the Universal Envoy in Cloud Dream Swamp last time. One of them should have been a Floating Light Silk. At that time, no one knew what that item was for, so Morally Grey allowed Marco Polo Bun to keep it for future research.</p>
 <p>“I think I know where the Floating Light Silk is.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast recalled it as well after she spoke. “Are you referring to the Universal Envoy?”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane’s eyes lit up upon hearing what the two of them said.</p>
 <p>At that moment, unhappy that she’d been relegated to the background, Morning Glory Chime forcefully interjected herself into the conversation. “Did you guys mention Shadow Snaring Water just now? I know about that.”</p>
 <p>Her statement successfully drew the attention of the other three people. Of course, to her, Shen Jingbin’s attention wasn’t important.</p>
 <p>Seeing the gazes of these two outstanding men finally on her instead of that ugly woman, Morning Glory Chime intentionally straightened her back to accentuate her ample bosom and said, “Last time when I was admiring the scenery at Ice Extermination Cavern in Youzhou, I came across an NPC that I’d never seen before. He told me that there was a small pool at the bottom of Ice Extermination Cavern and that the name of the water contained within the pool was called Shadow Snaring Water.”</p>
