 <p><b>Chapter 319: Preparing For Battle (1)</b></p>
 <p>Early the next morning, B City was greeted with a pleasant sunny day; one which hadn't appeared for the longest of times in winter. Despite that, many people didn't have the time to enjoy the wonderful weather.</p>
 <p>As the sun peeked over the horizon, many people had awakened to the sound of the alarms they’d set. In high spirits, they pulled themselves out of bed and climbed into their gaming pods. The dark patches beneath their eyes making it clear that they hadn’t slept the previous night.</p>
 <p>The system had announced that the final battle would take place at 10 o’clock sharp. Zhao Chengning’s call at 8 awakened Shen Jingbin. She logged into the game and checked her friend list. Other than Gentle Flower, the rest of the Lead Disciples were present. When she asked Qi Mu for an update, Shen Jingbin found that Qi Mu had leveled at a pretty quick pace, and she was at Level 119 now, with around half a bar of experience left to reach Level 120. There was still another two hours to go, reaching Level 120 should be possible if she worked a little harder.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin logged back into the same place she was at when she’d disconnected yesterday - White Cloud Temple. Though it was still early, the entirety of White Cloud Temple was jam-packed with players. Different from the strange or mocking looks she used to receive in the past, everyone’s gaze was now filled with hope and fervor. There were even a few of them who ran up to her and emotionally grabbed her hand.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister! No matter what you look like, please lead us to glory!"</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, please continue bringing in your luck. Love you, muack!”</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, I’ve decided to follow your lead and protect you today! Please don’t recklessly charge ahead!”</p>
 <p>After finally escaping the White Cloud Temple players who were becoming increasingly passionate, Shen Jingbin decided to seek out Song Yuqing. Shen Jingbin just so happened to run into him coming out of his residence when she reached the entrance to his abode.</p>
 <p>“Master, where are you heading out to?”</p>
 <p>Song Yuqing was dressed differently from how he usually looked. Though he was still donned in the plain robes of White Cloud Temple, the material was clearly of a much higher quality, and light grey cloud-like patterns were adorning it. He appeared exceptionally well-groomed today; as though he’d taken extra care of his appearance.</p>
 <p>“You came at just the right time. Come with me to the Southern Sea; the Six Great Sects are joining forces with the Four Guardians of the Southern Sea to defend against the Shinra Sect. The Dragonkin Tower has sent word for us to head over to Samgha Ruins first.”</p>
 <p>The top ten officially recorded individuals of exceptional strength were made up of the Southern Sea’s Four Guardians and the six Sect Leaders of the Six Great Sects. Of course, other rogue individuals weren’t taken into consideration. That being said, both groups were evenly matched in strength (NPCs from the Shinra Sect aside). The alliance between the Six Great Sects and the Four Guardians of the Southern Sea further assured their victory.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded and followed him after sending mail to Quiet And Steadfast and company.</p>
 <p>However, when she reached Samgha Ruins, she realised that Quiet And Steadfast and Pure Crane were there as well.</p>
 <p>“Daoist Song, you’ve arrived,” After they landed, the first to speak was Sect Leader Fennel from the Nymph Abode. “Daoist, please come along with me; there’s something I need to discuss with you.”</p>
 <p>Song Yuqing looked around. When he saw that none of the disciples from the Mara Hall, Nymph Abode nor Dragonkin Tower were present, he asked about them.</p>
 <p>The Sect Leader of the Swordmaster Pavilion, Lu Yinzhou, spoke up. “The three Sect Leaders from the younger generation are tied up with something else at the moment. Brother Song, do come inside with us.”</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Shen Jingbin had just arrived, so she didn’t quite understand the situation. Despite that, she could still sense the tense atmosphere.</p>
 <p>“The Sect Leader of Dragonkin Tower is injured, so she can’t fight. The ten strongest individuals are now short one member, and the individual in question is a mage - the class that does the highest damage. As the Lead Disciple of the Dragonkins, Qi Mu would have been the Sect Leader’s replacement, but there’s no way she can put out the same amount of damage,” Quiet And Steadfast answered.</p>
 <p>“In other words, we’ll have a problem when our BOSS appears,” Pure Crane added.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin frowned. “What are we going to do then?”</p>
 <p>“The Sect Leaders have probably gone inside to discuss how to deal with this situation. The Shinra Sect has five elders, and each of them has the strength to take on a hundred men. The ten Masters are there to keep them in check. If we’re short on even a single person, someone else has to take up the empty position,” Quiet And Steadfast replied.</p>
 <p>“How do you know all that?” Shen Jingbin asked.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s expression turned a little uncomfortable. “Hundred Daybreaks told me.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin gave him a meaningful look.</p>
 <p>“Uh, it’s only a temporary alliance; we’re only working together for this battle,” Quiet And Steadfast stammered out.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin shrugged. “I haven’t said anything.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
