 <p><span style><strong>Chapter 103:</strong> </span><b>A Disturbance On Weibo</b><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> </span><strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost as if he’d smelt the food, Shen Jingchen descended from the second floor shortly after Aunt Zhang set all the dishes on the table. Upon noticing that all the dishes on the table were his favorites, a brilliant smile instantly blossomed on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shot a look of disdain at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After their dinner, the siblings helped Aunt Zhang to clear up the dining table before they left for a walk to help digest their food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it was a virtual reality game and they spent all their time lying in a gaming pod, playing games from dawn till dusk would definitely affect one’s body in some way.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem">So, the siblings still had to go out for a bit of exercise once they were done with their meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their small villa was located close to A City University, making the commute to school very convenient. It was also near a park. In the evenings, the surrounding temperature would drop, making it several degrees colder than it was during the day. Shen Jingbin draped a shawl around her as she slowly walked along the lush sidewalk with Shen Jingchen beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been to the Demonic Sect’s map before?” A gust of wind blew past as Shen Jingbin asked and she pulled her shawl closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I’ve been there before. What about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they weren’t in the game, their conversation still revolved around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how much do you know about the Undying City?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Undying City? What’s that?” Shen Jingchen asked in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin suddenly felt like an idiot after seeing the look of bewilderment on Shen Jingchen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Undying City was discovered by Black Hawk’s group, so Shen Jingchen obviously wouldn’t know anything about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch. You obviously think I’m an idiot. You’ve already asked me about it, so how can it be nothing? Hey, did you run into something new again? What the f*ck, hurry up and tell your big bro about it! Knowing you, you definitely wouldn’t ask about the game without good reason,” It was rare to see Shen Jingchen’s IQ making its presence known. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s really nothing. I happened to run into a few friends when I went to the Demonic Sect’s map, and we stepped onto the teleportation point for Undying City. The city seemed a bit strange, so I wanted to ask you about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strange in what way?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin thought for a moment before she briefly recounted what had happened in Undying City to Shen Jingchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as reality soon showed, Shen Jingchen’s IQ wasn’t always present. After listening to Shen Jingbin’s recount of what had happened, not only did he not provide any useful suggestions, he even tried to get something out of it for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, I say, bring me along the next time you guys go over to Undying City. I’m confident that there’s a huge treasure up for grabs… I’ve been to the Demonic Sect’s map quite a few times already, but I haven’t even gotten a single thing. For better or for worse, you’re my little sister, so let me bask a little in your good fortune.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin shoved him away from her face and said, “Get lost, that’s not gonna happen. I wasn’t the one who found the teleportation point, so I have no right to make decisions on these matters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen wore a look of flattery on his face as he said, “Then why don’t you have a chat with your companions about it. It’s not like adding me into the team is gonna result in any huge loss for you guys. By the way, who’re your teammates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Swordmaster called Pure Crane…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he heard Pure Crane’s name, Shen Jingchen immediately cried out, “What the fuck, Crane?! Shen Jingbin, why the hell are you teaming up with Pure Crane?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin cast a dubious glance at him and asked, “What’s wrong with Pure Crane? Although he looks like someone who’s a bit of a schemer, general interaction with him shouldn’t be a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pui, don’t tell me you don’t know what kind of person he is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen shot a look of resentment at her and said, “Baby girl, Pure Crane is the Vice-Leader of Sovereign’s Descent. You should know about Sovereign’s Descent and Life At First Sight’s recent deception, right? No matter what, you’re now the wife of Jade Sea Pavilion’s Guild Leader, so you should keep your distance from the guild’s potential enemies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin rolled her eyes at Shen Jingchen and walked up to him with each step increasing in speed. When she spoke, the wind brought her gentle voice to his ears, “I don’t need you to worry about me, I’ll keep my distance from him once I’m done with Undying City. Moreover, I had no intentions of getting closer to them anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen stared hatefully at his sister’s back before he ran up to her and said, “Why’re you rushing off so quickly, wait for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many people who went out for a walk after having their meal, and the park’s plaza was filled to the brim with old aunties who were dancing [2. It’s a form of physical activity in China. Here’s a video of how it looks like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E0F-5cVpGo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Click</span></a><span style>]. Shen Jingbin found a random stone stool to sit on and leaned back on it as she fished out her handphone and started to browse the forums. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a habit she’d cultivated from playing games.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t ask her why she was whipping out her phone when she was supposed to be out on a walk; she just needed to take a short break.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Following closely behind her, Shen Jingchen sat beside Shen Jingbin with his hands in his pockets as he looked over her shoulder and glaced at her screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A forum post was open on her phone, but the words were too small and he couldn’t see clearly. “What are you looking at?” He asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guides for &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;,” Shen Jingbin absent-mindedly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen scoffed and said, “You’re still looking at guides? Is there any point to it at this stage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin raised her head and glanced at him. “I’m looking at guides for investigating the Demonic Sect. Whether or not there’s any point to it is none of your business,” With that, she raised her hand and smacked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, you’re really ruthless,” Shen Jingchen said as he suddenly hugged his body in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re better off dating a man with such a weak body,” Shen Jingbin said as she coldly dealt the final blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen immediately sat up straight and shot back, “Pui, your big bro is brimming with manliness! I don’t need no man, I want a delicate and cute girl instead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin couldn’t be bothered to reply, snorting in response as she started browsing the forums with single-minded dedication.</span></p>
