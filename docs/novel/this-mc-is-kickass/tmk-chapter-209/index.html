 <p>As they made their way through the building, their group swept countless people off their feet. Within five minutes, the entire building knew that a super beautiful woman was in their midst.</p>
 <p>In the end, Xiangpeng brought them to a high-end meeting room that exuded refinement. Apart from them, the room was devoid of other people. Xiangpeng brewed a cup of tea for each of them before taking his leave.</p>
 <p>“I still have something to do, so I’ll be taking my leave first. I'll have to trouble you guys to wait here for a bit as our Director’s still in a meeting. He'll be over immediately once he’s done,” With that, he opened the door and was about to leave, when he suddenly thought of something and turned back to them. “Oh, that’s right. Miss Xue will be over in a bit as well.”</p>
 <p>After a nod of acknowledgement from the group, he left to take care of his own matters.</p>
 <p>The moment the meeting room’s door shut, Xuya stood up and started looking around.</p>
 <p>Zhao Chengning glanced at him, and asked, “What're you doing?”</p>
 <p>Xuya continued searching and replied without lifting his head, “Aren't IT companies known for their perverse 360-degree surveillance tools? I need to have a good look around to see if there's any here.”</p>
 <p>“Bro, I think you’ve watched too many shows,” Shen Jingchen said.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin nodded. “I think so too.”</p>
 <p>Xuya immediately wore a pained look on his face and pressed his hand against his chest. “Oh, Little Jing, how can you say that about me? Your words wound me so!”</p>
 <p>Black lines appeared on Shen Jingbin’s head. “<i>Lil bro, your acting sucks.”</i></p>
 <p>Xue Sijia sat in an MPV and listened to her Manager run through her schedule for the day. Though she was very famous, she didn't have that many appearances on screen. To be precise, she had just the right amount of exposure to ensure that the masses wouldn’t forget her, while at the same time ensuring that her fickle audience wouldn’t grow bored of her.</p>
 <p>This was all thanks to her Manager’s careful ministrations. Her Manager was undoubtedly skilled.</p>
 <p>Once her Manager had finished reading out her schedule for the day, she propped up the spectacles on her nose and said, “I just got a call from Yiju. They said your competitor’s already arrived; we need to hurry up. Touch up your makeup while we're on the way, we’ll be going straight up once we reach there.”</p>
 <p>Xue Sijia was gorgeous, but she had a pale complexion. Without makeup, she looked a lot less energetic. She was exceptional at applying makeup though, and apart from a veteran makeup artist, no one else would be able to tell that she had a layer of makeup on.</p>
 <p>Which is why celebs and their so-called no makeup faces were all a bunch of lies.</p>
 <p>After hearing that, Xue Sijia took out her foundation and touched up her makeup. While doing so, she asked, “She’s already there? Heh, how enthusiastic.”</p>
 <p>Her Manager shrugged, her words full of hidden meanings as she said, “Even though she was reluctant to be their ambassador, which girl these days wouldn’t want to be famous and appear in the limelight? Just look at how enthusiastic she is; she's probably just playing hard to get. Then again, there are plenty of people who come from good backgrounds in this industry... Remember to show your stuff later on if you want this role.”</p>
 <p>Xue Sijia slammed the lid shut of a certain brand’s CC cushion box, and raised her chin. “I know, just watch.”</p>
 <p>Her Manager immediately felt a surge of confidence when she heard Xue Sijia’s reply.</p>
 <p>Yiju was a large company, and they were shooting a promotional video for the online game that was ahead of its time, &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt;. Although her Manager had never dealt with contracts for game ambassadors before, she clearly knew that if Xue Sijia succeeded, her popularity might increase to a new level, and she’d be able to break through her current status as a popular new star.</p>
 <p>When they reached Yiju, Xue Sijia’s Manager brought her straight inside. Once inside, a stereotypical IT girl appeared by the lift and showed them in.</p>
 <p>The girl was very sorry for being late and apologised profusely from the time she saw them till they entered the lift.</p>
 <p>“Miss Xue, I’m so sorry for taking up your time. I’m very sorry for making you wait.”</p>
 <p>Xue Sijia didn’t reply and just stared silently at the lift’s changing numbers with her shades on.</p>
 <p>Seeing the girl repeatedly apologise, Xue Sijia’s Manager turned to her and said kindly, “Don’t worry, we understand that all of you are very busy as well, so you don’t need to be so courteous.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, the girl stopped apologising and smiled shyly at the Manager before she secretly peeped at Xue Sijia out of the corner of her eyes.</p>
 <p><i>She’s just as arrogant and as cold as the rumours said! Speaking of which, she looks prettier in person than she does on TV!</i></p>
 <p>If it hadn’t been for the fact that there was another striking beauty who’d come to their office today, she might’ve become Xue Sijia’s fan!</p>
 <p>This world that was obsessed with outward appearances was just that straightforward.</p>
