 <p><b>Chapter 291: Encountering Quarrelsome Fish Once Again (1)</b></p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Not A Monster: They say that the New Year ushers in change. But, if that’s the case, then why am I still a single dog being oppressed by all the couples out there!?</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m Really Not A Monster: You're wrong. You were only slightly mistreated before this, but you’ve been absolutely destroyed now. ( ﾟ▽ﾟ)/ Tch tch tch. I see our Leader gifting his wife a mount the moment I log on. Our Leader is truly overbearing.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Actually, I Am A Monster: Am I the only one who’s noticed that Leader gave the Great Sage’s Child? There's only one Great Sage’s Child in the entire server, right? Madam Guild Leader sure is lucky!</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m A Monster, Dare To Hit Me: Woof woof woof woof woof!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Yanmen Imperial Sister: Ole Four, what’re you trying to say?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Slight Chill: … Please speak human.</p>
 <p>[Guild] I’m A Monster, Dare To Hit Me: I was trying to say that I’d noticed!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: ...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eternal Rest: ...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Long Life: ...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: You truly are a master of the English language.</p>
 <p>The server-wide announcement instantly made Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast the talk of the town once again. And with that, the popular rumour of them getting ‘divorced soon’ that had spread since the day they’d gotten married finally stopped circulating.</p>
 <p>After all, if you didn't truly love someone, you wouldn't put so much effort into trying to make her happy; especially if her looks were nothing to write home about.</p>
 <p>Crying Fish’s entire body started trembling the moment she saw the announcement. Despite that, she couldn't do a single thing about it. She wasn’t a match for Nutjob any longer, and Quiet And Steadfast wouldn’t even spare a glance for her. All she could do was stew within her impotent rage.</p>
 <p>When her party members following behind her noticed how depressed she was, they asked, “Leader, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Crying Fish shook her head. “I'm fine.”</p>
 <p>“Tactless much? Didn't you guys see the server announcement just now? Quiet And Steadfast’s blind. Forget marrying that ugly wench; he’s now even putting on a public display of affection for her. Isn’t he only with her because she’s a Lead Disciple? Hmph!” The Nymph who was on good terms with Crying Fish said indignantly.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, Lead Disciples like her are a class apart from us. Commoners like us can’t compare to her.”</p>
 <p>The Nymph girl snorted. “So what if she’s a Lead Disciple? That doesn’t change the fact that she’s an ugly cow!”</p>
 <p>Following that, her eyes suddenly lit up as if she’d thought of something. She turned to Crying Fish and said, “Fish, don't be so down, isn’t the position of Lead Disciple for the Nymph Abode still open? Come on, let's head back to the sect and have a look at it. You’re lucky, so who knows? You might discover the hidden quest to become the Lead Disciple of the Nymph Abode. When Quiet And Steadfast comes looking to you for help, he'll realise how large the difference is between you and that ugly monster. I refuse to believe that those blind men won’t be able to see your worth at that time!”</p>
 <p>The girl’s words seemed to have revealed a brand new realm in Crying Fish’s head.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, why didn’t I think of that? The Lead Disciple of the Nymphs is the only Lead Disciple position that’s open now. They’re probably thinking of gathering all the Lead Disciples as quickly as possible too. If I become the Lead Disciple of the Nymphs, Quiet And Steadfast wouldn’t be able to ignore me even if he wanted to!”</p>
 <p>Crying Fish gave a solemn nod at what she’d just said as if she was trying to reassure herself before turning to her companions. “Let's head back to the Nymph Abode now!”</p>
 <p>The people following her grunted in acknowledgement and hurried over to the Nymph Abode.</p>
 <p>On Shen Jingbin’s end, she’d finally received a reply from Shen Jingchen after the server-wide announcement. However, it remained just as caustic as his previous behaviour. “What do you want?! Hurry up and go cuddle with your husband! Hmph!”</p>
 <p>As she stared at his reply, she couldn't help but wonder once again whether she’d unintentionally shattered his fragile ego.</p>
 <p>Seeing her at a loss, Quiet And Steadfast asked, “What's wrong? Who was it from?”</p>
 <p>She handed him the letter from Shen Jingchen and said, “I don't know what happened to him, but he’s suddenly all riled up.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast figured out what the problem was the moment he read the mail and was torn between laughing and crying. “You haven’t shown much concern for your brother as of late, have you?”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin innocently blinked at him. “Haven’t I always been like this to him though?”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast gave a light cough. “Things have changed; you have me now. Him becoming unhappy when he realises how differently you treat the two of us is only normal.”</p>
 <p>His words had allowed her to see the light.</p>
 <p>It finally dawned on her that her older brother was probably feeling jealous, and that was why he’d been giving her the cold shoulder!</p>
 <p><i>Sigh, what a tsundere.</i></p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast figured she’d understood what he was trying to get at when he saw the look of realization on her face.</p>
 <p>“Then what should I do now?” She had no idea how to pacify Shen Jingchen; especially since she’d gotten used to bullying him!</p>
