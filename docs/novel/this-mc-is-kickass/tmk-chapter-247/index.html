 <p><b>Chapter 247: Leaving Jade Sea Pavilion (1)</b></p>
 <p>Seeing as tomorrow was Monday, they didn’t stay out too late and slowly began dispersing when it was about time to leave. Ever since he’d tried to proclaim his love for Shen Jingbin just now, all the way till the time he sent the siblings home, Zhao Chengning hadn’t found the chance to be alone with her. And so, his question went unanswered.</p>
 <p>Over the next few days, both the Shen siblings and Zhao Chengning were particularly busy. With the New Year just around the corner, their respective companies were preparing for their annual meetings. In addition, each department also had to work on their year-end summaries. They were so busy they started wishing they had the ability to turn a single day into two. At the same time, their hectic work life naturally meant that Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning’s romance had to be relegated to the backburner.</p>
 <p>A week had passed by before work died down.</p>
 <p>Seeing how hard the siblings had worked, and the fact that they’d more or less learned everything they needed to learn, Ye Linfan gave them several days off with a wave of his hand. The siblings didn’t dare go out to have fun though as it was about time for the Shen elders to pay them. Instead, they used their break as an opportunity to log in to the game that had been left to the side for a long while.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Vice Leader Dawn’s Twilight has come online.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: Oh, Dawn you're here?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Little Monk: Yoooooooo Dawn, long time no see, I've missed you so much!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eight National Treasures: Nutty’s online too.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eternal Rest: Nutty, Dawn, have you guys been busy? Haven’t seen you guys for a long time.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Long Life: Even the number of fortuitous events have decreased without Mascot around.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: We’ve been interning lately and were a little busy, so we couldn’t come online. Sorry about that.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Tanabata Evening: Dawn, you're interning already? To be honest, since New Year’s around the corner, we haven’t been able to get our hands on all of the attractive in-game events since we have to do overtime at our jobs. What a shame.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Faint Blue Seaweed: Yeah, I’ve been worked to the bone recently, but I'm still logging into the game. This is what true love is like.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Syrup Time: Nutty, aren't you still in schooling? You're interning on top of that?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Mm. I'll be graduating soon, so it’s not a bad idea for me to gain some experience beforehand.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Descent Of Rain And Snow: I'm so jealous of you guys! I’m graduating soon too, but I still haven't found a job! My family’s also hurrying me to find a job, get a boyfriend, get married, and then have some kids. They’re kicking up so much of a fuss that I can’t even think straight.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin remembered that Descent Of Rain And Snow was around the same age as she was, but she was being forced to get married?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Already? You're still young though.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Descent Of Rain And Snow: I think I'm still young too, but my parents were spurred on after the girl next door, who was a year younger than me, gave birth to a kid. They feel that I’m already old enough, so they want me to settle down. But the thing is, all the guys around me are even more useless than me, so who am I supposed to marry?! Oh, speaking of which, Nutty, your Hubby used to be my God last time!</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Uh...</p>
 <p>[Guild] Descent Of Rain And Snow: But don't worry, I don’t have the guts to go after him even if I do like him. I’ll just admire him from afar.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Yanmen Imperial Sister: Speaking of which, Leader hasn't logged on during this time either.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Temperate Scarlet Moon: Doesn’t Leader run his own company? He's probably busy as well since he usually doesn’t log on much during the New Year period.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Big Buddhist Monk: Leader’s on noticeably less this time around though; even Next Week’s gone missing.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Eternal Rest: Thank goodness there's still us old guards and regular members around to help out when our guild’s backbone isn’t around. Otherwise, the enemy probably would’ve taken advantage of this opportunity to strike.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Dawn’s Twilight: Mhm? Did something big happen when we weren’t around? Did anything happen with the Shinra Sect, Sovereigns Descent, Life At First Sight, or the like?</p>
 <p>[Guild] Syrup Time: Now that you mention it, Sovereign’s Descent and Life At First Sight have been crazy arrogant lately. I bumped into them several times when I accompanied a group of people to collect herbs and they provoked us the moment they ran into us. Aren’t they a being stupid though? They obviously couldn’t win but they were still trying to court death. Guess not everyone has a brain.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: Nutty, you should be a little more careful. Our enemies have been trying to cause trouble for us these days, so you need to watch yourself when you go to PK zones.</p>
 <p>[Guild] Nutjob: Okay.</p>
 <p>After fooling around a little more with her guildmates, Shen Jingbin decided to pay her sect a visit. But just as she teleported to the entrance of White Cloud Temple, she received mail from Pure Crane.</p>
 <p>“You’re finally on.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin sent out her reply as she made her way towards the Sect Leader’s residence, “Did something happen?”</p>
 <p>The NPCs who were going to and fro around White Cloud Temple all paused when they saw her and gave a very respectful bow. “Greetings, Great Senior Sister.” Shen Jingbin nodded back in reply before continuing on her way.</p>
 <p>“Mm, something did happen. Where are you? I want to have a face-to-face chat with you.”</p>
 <p>“I’m at White Cloud Temple,” After replying, Shen Jingbin turned and walked towards White Cloud Temple’s main hall.</p>
 <p>Pure Crane moved quickly and was already there waiting for her when she reached the main hall. Many of the players and NPCs gathered in the area broke off into groups of twos and threes to start whispering amongst themselves.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin got straight to the point and asked, “What happened?”</p>
 <p>Pure Crane glanced around before he replied, “Let’s find somewhere with fewer people around.”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin had also felt no small amount of gazes directed at her. She’d only come here to make it easier for Pure Crane to find her and hadn’t expected to be gawked at by so many people. After all, she was of the opinion that all players should mind their own business.</p>
 <p>However, she’d evidently underestimated the gossipy nature of players.</p>
