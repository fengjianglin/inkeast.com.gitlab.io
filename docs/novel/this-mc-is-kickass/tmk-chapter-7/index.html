 <p><strong>Chapter 7: Gossip</strong><span style>Shen Jingchen’s appearance immediately caused a group of female players in the vicinity to become restless. Shen Jingbin felt rather amazed upon overhearing their discussion. Was Shen Jingchen really that handsome? Then why did she find him so repulsive! Was there something wrong with her aesthetics? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you? I’ve reached the coach station, why don’t I see you?” Shen Jingchen kept his Celestial pet out the moment he landed on the ground. He tried looking around, but the lack of a familiar face made him feel a little bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What an idiot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruthlessly looking down on Shen Jingchen in her heart, Shen Jingbin stood up and brushed the hem of her clothes. She walked over to him and said, “Don’t bother looking anymore, I’m over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s eyes widened and he took a large step backwards as if he’d just received a fright, “That can’t be. Little Jingjing, are you making fun of me? How could someone this ugly be you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I have to mention the red birthmark on your butt before you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen hurriedly rushed up to her and covered her mouth, “What the f*ck! Can you not mention these things in public!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying so, he didn’t forget to survey his surroundings, only releasing Shen Jingbin after confirming the people further away from them couldn’t hear anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin cast a sidelong glance at him before she shrugged and said, “I’m simply verifying my identity.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Screw you!</span></i><span style> Shen Jingchen felt as if he’d cursed out ten thousand times in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? You’re level 20 already? You’re leveling pretty fast!” After tossing over a party invitation to Shen Jingbin, he was given a fright by her leveling speed when she entered the party, </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you just start playing a while ago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin was unperturbed by his reaction and replied, “I encountered a hidden quest. Stop wasting time, hurry up and find someone who can welcome me into a sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“...” Does my mom know how fierce you are? <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen’s mount could seat two people. Being afflicted by her laziness disease, Shen Jingbin forced him to give her a ride before they took flight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingchen shed an imaginary tear as Shen Jingbin got onto his mount. He could already foresee this becoming the next day’s top story on the game’s forum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The male god, Dawn’s Twilight, from the Jade Sea Pavilion was seen with an ugly woman as they sat intimately together on his mount!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The horror! Your male god was taken away by a woman looking like that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A certain well-known male player gamed together with an ugly woman for the sake of wealth. Was it a loss of morality or a distortion of human nature?!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span><span style><span>After stepping out of an instanced dungeon<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>, Quiet And Steadfast immediately received a mail from a friend within the guild. </span></span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“F*ck, I just saw Dawn<a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> riding together with a woman! Any idea who she is?!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast furrowed his brows. What’s so surprising about Dawn being together with another woman? He’d always garnered the affections of women all along anyway. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t. What’s up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other party’s reply came swiftly. It looks like it really was a major event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahaha! I happened to see how she looked like! My god. Truth be told, I’ve never seen anyone who looked like that before! Even big sis Feng looks dozens of times better than her! Who would’ve thought that after being so unrestrained and garnering the affection of many women, Dawn would actually have such “unique” tastes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...So you’re reveling in the misfortune of others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No no, definitely not! It’s just that that bitch keeps snatching all the girls I set my eyes on. Now with all this happening to him, I couldn’t help but gossip a little. At the same time, I wanted to see if I could get some of the inside story on what happened so I could make fun of him! But you look like you don’t know anything, so forget it! I’ll ask other people instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After putting away the carrier pigeon, Quiet And Steadfast called out his mount and made his way towards the warehouse in the capital. Along the way, he wondered how her appearance was enough to make his friend think he could use it to launch an attack on Dawn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, these things had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Opening his quest log, his gaze fell onto the gold coloured quest and his eyes twinkled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’d been a long time since he received the quest, but he wasn’t able to make any headway even till now. Was giving up his only option?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No. He’d put in far too much effort in getting the quest to just give up here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Additionally, the people from Life At First Sight seemed to be plotting something in secret. They had been carrying out a lot of underground activities recently, so he needed to use this quest to raise the strength of Jade Sea Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, he had to complete this quest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Closing his quest log, Quiet And Steadfast rearranged the items in his backpack and placed them in the warehouse. After which, he said his farewells to his guild members before logging off.</span></p>
