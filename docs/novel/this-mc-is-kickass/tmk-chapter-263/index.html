 <p><b>Chapter 263: Battle of the Supporting Female Characters (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Are the two of you here to eat?” Long Dinghai looked between the couple before resting his gaze on Zhao Chengning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning nodded. “Mr Long’s here for the same reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I came here to accompany a friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone turned their attention to the woman by Long Dinghai’s side. A wave of realization hit Shen Jingbin when she caught sight of the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman was that celebrity who was gaining popularity these days, and she worked for Long Dinghai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing everyone’s attention on her, the woman proudly stuck out her chest and glanced at Shen Jingbin in passing. She’d already prepared herself, and she was waiting for Zhao Chengning to inquire about her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, all he did was glance at her before promptly ignoring her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Shen, the promotional video you filmed with Xue Sijia from my company for Yiju has been released,” Long Dinghai said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin froze for a moment. “Is that so? I wasn’t informed about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Dinghai smiled. “They'll probably let you know in the next day or two. If possible, I look forward to working with you again in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A glint of all-consuming desire flashed across his eyes, unsettling Shen Jingbin. “Things such as our future cooperation together depends on whether he agrees,” She replied as she used her chin to point at Zhao Chengning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Dinghai’s expression flickered for a moment before he smiled. “Has Mr Zhao switched over to being a manager instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not her manager; I’m just her boyfriend,” He calmly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions of Long Dinghai and the woman beside him froze. Shen Jingbin shot a sly wink at Zhao Chengning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Good job!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bon travail! </span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning’s lips curled up as he smiled back at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a waiter walked over with the food that Shen Jingbin and Zhao Chengning had ordered. Long Dinghai exchanged a few more pleasantries with them before returning to his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Long Dinghai and his partner walked off, Shen Jingbin grumbled a little, “What rotten luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning took a sip of his red wine and said, “To be honest, this place isn’t all that good anyway. Let’s not come here in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them exchanged a knowing smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dinner, Zhao Chengning sent Shen Jingbin home. The next day, she sent him a text message saying that she was going to keep her parents’ company, so he was in no rush to go online.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slept his fill and washed up before slowly taking his time to log into the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d more or less taken care of most of his work during his previous work frenzy, and he’d handed the rest of it over to Zhao Chengan, so he didn’t need to worry about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After logging into the game, he took a quick peek at the guild page before exchanging his money and materials for the New Year event. He then went to clear his dailies with his fixed party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While doing their dailies, the party talked about the new outfits and mounts that were released for the New Year event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever there was a significant event, the game company would throw in some valuable tools along with event only outfits and mounts. If you missed one of these events, your only chance of getting your hands on these items again would be to pay an exorbitant amount to buy them off another player. Due to the limited number of these items in existence, being able to buy them wasn’t a sure-fire thing even if players were willing to pay for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to Hundred Daybreaks, he had a pretty good understanding of the outfits and mounts on offer this time. She’d spent an entire hour on Wechat the night before going on and on about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The outfit available this time was an eye-catching red dress that had a v-neck, giving it a seductive quality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he laid eyes on the dress, he got the feeling it’d fit Shen Jingbin to a T in real life. When he tried thinking about how she’d look in it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d probably be better off not thinking about it. It was a little too stimulating for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that case, how would Nutjob look in it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d be better off not thinking about that either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that case, he’d give her a mount instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>With the year of the monkey approaching, the game company released a mount with that theme in mind. Earlier on, Yiju had invested in producing an animated film featuring the Great Sage, Equal of Heaven<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, enjoying a pretty good reception and garnering many fans. The game company had taken this opportunity to jump on the bandwagon and release its own chibi mount of the Great Sage, Equal of Heaven.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>She’d probably like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once done with his dailies, Quiet And Steadfast bid farewell to the rest of the members of his party and made his way to the location of the NPC event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Event tokens were earned by completing related event quests. Completion of an event quest would earn players an event box, and these boxes would have a chance of containing the needed tokens to exchange for mounts or outfits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the chance of getting these event tokens was abysmally low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the outfits and mounts offered by the NPCs were limited. To ensure that he got a mount, Zhao Chengning sent out a mass of mails offering to buy event tokens while clearing his quests. He also made sure to ask about it in the guild chat too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Quiet And Steadfast: Buying ‘General’s Directive’. Message me if you have it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Eternal Rest: I just got my hands on one. Leader, are you interested in outfits and mounts too? I don’t think the male outfit looks all that good though; it’s bright red and looks like boiled shrimp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Next Week Is Unlikely: I have a few here too. Where are you? I’ll head over and pass it to you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Little Monk: Leader, are you interested in the mount? You need 88 General’s Directives to exchange for it though. They’re obviously trying to screw with us by making the General’s Directive’s drop chance so low. Not a single person’s gotten enough for it yet, and all the unscrupulous merchants are trying to capitalize on this by setting sky-high prices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Eight National Treasures: (*￣Ｏ￣)ノ I’ve been running these quests for an entire week now and I’ve only managed to get 49 boxes. Till now, I haven’t been able to get a single General’s Directive. I’m getting the feeling these things don’t even exist in the game!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Lingering White Clouds: Ahahahaha. Don’t cry National Treasure, you’re not the unluckiest one out there. There’s someone with even worse luck than you! I’m Not A Monster opened around 100 boxes, but didn’t get anything either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Descent Of Rain And Snow: Hahahaha, how pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] Faint Blue Seaweed: My heart goes out to all of you. Although I didn’t get any either, I haven’t been running these quests day in and day out hahahaha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Guild] National Treasure: Get lost! ｡･ﾟﾟ･(&gt;д&lt;)･ﾟﾟ･｡</span></p>
 <p><span style>A quick glance through the guild chat revealed that only five people in the entire guild had gotten their hands on a General’s Directive. Even the one with the most items only had three of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Chengning sent his location to them before settling in to wait for their arrival.</span></p>
