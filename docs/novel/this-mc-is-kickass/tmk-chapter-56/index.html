 <p><strong>Chapter 56: Marriage (2)&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><span style>I’m Not A Monster was nominated as the representative by youngsters who were brimming with curiosity. He jogged over to Quiet And Steadfast’s side and asked with an innocent expression on his face, “Boss, why are you suddenly thinking about marriage? We didn’t heard a single thing about this beforehand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quiet And Steadfast had no intention of concealing the matter from everyone. He cleared his throat and raised his voice so that everyone could hear. “All of you should know about the Epic Grade hidden quest that I received before right? There’s been some progress with the quest, but to carry on I need to marry Nutjob. This is why the marriage was so sudden.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Descent Of Rain And Snow said, “Boss is sacrificing his body for the sake of our guild. Ah, my heart goes out to you! Nutty, our boss is a good man. You have to take good care of him alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Jingbin, “...I’ll do my best.”</span></p>
 <p>I’m A Monster, Dare To Hit Me also came over to join in on the fun. Holding a hand to his throat, he began to wail pitifully, “Wuuuuuu, boss, you’re marrying someone else today. Regardless of why you're doing it, I feel so pained inside. Ah! My heart, it hurts so much. I can’t breathe!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin, “...Then I’ll swap places with you.”</p>
 <p>I Am A Monster, Dare To Hit Me, “F*ck, I was just joking! I wish the two of you happiness! Farewell!”</p>
 <p>Everyone: <i>“WHERE’D YOUR PRIDE GO!?”</i></p>
 <p>Everyone in Jade Sea Pavilion had always gotten along. Once someone took the lead, the rest began to join in the fun with the intention of teasing the duo that shocked all players in the game.</p>
 <p>It’s a pity that the two’s mental fortitudes were out of the ordinary, so everyone could only return in low spirits.</p>
 <p>Amidst their fun, everyone suddenly felt their vision distort for an instant. When they came back to their senses, a sagacious old man wearing a lunar white robe stood in front of everyone while stroking his beard.</p>
 <p>“The auspicious time has arrived, may the groom please follow this old man.” The elder was all smiles as he spoke to Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast.</p>
 <p>As someone who’d been through this before, Eternal Rest went over to Quiet And Steadfast’s side and shared some knowledge on the marriage proceedings. “Leader, this old man is the Matchmaker. In a bit, the two of you will go in together before bowing once to Heaven and Earth. You will then finish the ceremony by drinking from the nuptial cup. It’s really simple, you don’t have to be nervous.”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast: <i>Does it look like I’m nervous?</i></p>
 <p>In her heart, Shen Jingbin had a face full of tears:<i> I’m the one who’s actually feeling very nervous here. Why didn’t any of you notice?!</i></p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen: <i>Who asked you to be so ugly, we can’t read your expression at all!</i></p>
 <p>Under everyone’s support, Shen Jingbin and Quiet And Steadfast both followed behind the Matchmaker, entering the main hall of Matchmaker's Shrine.</p>
 <p>The entire temple was enveloped in bright red azaleas, which accentuated the festive mood of the wedding ceremony. Satin and petals from somewhere occasionally floated about in the wind, adding on to the atmosphere.</p>
 <p>“It takes ten years to stay in the same boat together, and a hundred years to share the same bed. Today, it is your destiny to be joined here as husband and wife. This elder will present you with a humble gift.” The Matchmaker said with a smile as he stood at the front of the hall.</p>
 <p>With that, a “Ding” resounded in their ears.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations on obtaining the Matchmaker’s Gift. I wish for the two of you a life filled with beautiful scenery and conjugal bliss. May the two of you have a happy marriage.”</p>
 <p>They found a set of wedding clothes inside the Matchmaker's Gift. The Matchmaker proceeded with the wedding ceremony after the two swiftly changed into the wedding clothes. &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; didn’t attach much importance to the marriage system, so the marriage proceedings were extremely simple. After three bows to Heaven and Earth, the system announced that the two were now husband and wife.</p>
 <p>[System] Paired Lovebirds, Branches Intertwined; Husband and Wife join each other in matrimony. Congratulations players Quiet And Steadfast and Nutjob, you are now husband and wife.</p>
 <p>After the ceremony, the Matchmaker gave his heartfelt wishes. “Now that the two of you have joined together in matrimony, may you never doubt one another. I hope that the two of you will grow old together and have many descendants.” With that, he disappeared.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha, my dear Brother-in-law, hurry up and call me Big Brother!” Shen Jingchen had long wanted to tease Quiet And Steadfast, but didn’t have the guts to do so. Now that his Leader had become his Brother-in-law, his sprout-like confidence encountered a growth spurt and instantly turned into a towering tree.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin shot a glare at him before Quiet And Steadfast could respond and said, “Get lost!”</p>
 <p>Shen Jingchen was teary-eyed. “Wuwuwu, my sister has only just married out and she’s already giving her family the cold shoulder.”</p>
 <p>Next Week Is Unlikely consoled him. “Dawn, don’t you know the saying; ‘you won’t die if you don’t say anything’?”</p>
 <p>National Treasure was speechless. “Next Week, are you sure you’re consoling him?”</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast was a generous person. That being said, he was even more unrestrained in his generosity when it came to his comrades. There were at least seventy to eighty people who attended their wedding. For each and every one of these people, he traded away a bottle of Shen Nong’s Secret Medicine and a red packet.</p>
 <p>Everyone was all smiles upon receiving these gifts.</p>
 <p>As a close comrade of the groom, Next Week Is Unlikely felt a rush of emotions as he watched his friend get married. In the heat of the moment, a Realm Announcement popped up.</p>
 <p>[Realm] Next Week Is Unlikely: Now that you’re finally married, no one can doubt my sexuality! Wishing Steady and Little Nutty a happy marriage!</p>
 <p>[Realm] Yanmen Imperial Sister: Wasn’t Dawn the one who was shipped with you?</p>
 <p>Surrounding players: ...</p>
 <p>There would never be a lack of people flattering you once someone took the lead. Not only were the people of Jade Sea Pavilion the cream of the crop in skill, they didn’t lose out in terms of their financial ability either. In an instant, an unceasing wave of golden words flew over the heads of everyone present.</p>
 <p>This was the first time players in &lt;&lt;Legends of Celestials and Demons&gt;&gt; had ever seen so many Realm Announcements in one go!</p>
 <p>As expected, friends of Gods were all loaded!</p>
 <p>Due to these events, the atmosphere inside the Matchmaker's Shrine was brought to a high. However, people who stir up trouble never fail to show up in marriages. Someone suddenly shouted, “Kiss!”</p>
 <p>The boisterous crowd inside the Matchmaker's Shrine suddenly fell silent.</p>
 <p>“Which idiot was it?!” Slight Chill’s impatient voice broke the awkward silence.</p>
 <p>Shen Jingbin couldn’t help but burst out laughing. “Just how large is your grudge with your Leader?” Saying that, she turned to look at Quiet And Steadfast.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast stood by her side while wearing his red groom’s clothing. This was her first time seeing him wear anything that wasn’t black. Unexpectedly, it suited him very well, although the image of his beautiful face was still obscured by that veil of his.</p>
 <p>Feeling her gaze, Quiet And Steadfast tilted his head and looked at her, their gazes meeting in that instant.</p>
 <p>Quiet And Steadfast’s eyes narrowed, and the image of his charming eyes filled with delight was burned deep into Shen Jingbin’s mind.</p>
