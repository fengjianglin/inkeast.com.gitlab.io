 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, why did you only come now!” Ye Qingzi found it hard to maintain her composure in Chu Mu’s embrace. She was like a spoiled wife whose heart was sweet, yet was still complaining.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu cracked a smile, and didn’t know how to explain himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he held her familiar and soft body in his arms, Chu Mu felt an unprecedented sense of calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had been used to being alone for a long time. But Ye Qingzi’s appearance gradually made Chu Mu walk out of his solitary path. She was always accompanying him and was great at understanding others. This made him feel as if she lived in his heart. Thus, when they suddenly split apart, he felt extremely unused to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been with Ye Qingzi now for many years, but the feelings between them hadn’t been worn away by time. Instead, they only increased day by day. In the past, when they split apart, Chu Mu wouldn’t feel much. But this time, when they split apart, the feelings had been especially intense. Originally, Chu Mu had planned on training in Wupan Continent for a period of time, but he didn’t feel at ease and ultimately decided to immediately go visit Ye Qingzi after bringing back Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finally seeing her, he didn’t know if it was because her cultivation had increased, or because he hadn’t seen her in a long time and thus missed her more, Chu Mu felt his heart rapidly beat towards this woman whom he was the most familiar with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu hugged her, and silently smelled the fragrance emanating from her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Chu Mu felt an angry glare from nearby!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s true strength was already at the immortal rank, and his perceptive abilities were extremely strong. Even if there were a pair of eyes with the slightest trace of unhappiness, Chu Mu would still be able to detect them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked up and saw, at the end of the flower forest’s small path, Han Erxing’s sharp eyes were glaring at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is it this fellow?!” Han Erxing threw the captivating flowers in his hand to the side. He didn’t cover up the anger on his face in the slightest!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing recognized the man hugging Ye Qingzi. It was that no-name peasant who had been asked to stay behind, alone, by Saintess Yu!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu also recognized Han Erxing, and he calmly met his angry glare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi, in his arms, didn’t realize Han Erxing was still there as her heart had been filled up by Chu Mu’s familiar and comfortable hug. She slowly lifted up her face and her slender arms wrapped around Chu Mu’s neck as she looked to kiss him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew Han Erxing’s intentions, but he lifted the corners of his mouth into a smile. He ignored his angry glare and lowered his head, tasting Ye Qingzi’s soft lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Erxing, at the end of the small path, saw the two of them kiss right in front of him, especially after that fellow’s mocking smile, he felt that it was the same as the scene from yesterday when Han Yufei, that nobody, had had his dream come true!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing’s face sank, and he turned around and left in a fit of anger!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The kiss was very slow. Chu Mu first started with just lightly kissing her lips, before gradually deepening the kiss. Then, he eventually put his restless tongue into Ye Qingzi’s, intertwining with her small tongue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more Ye Qingzi kissed, the more aroused she became. Her cheeks were flushed, and a mature charm appeared amidst the shyness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rare for Chu Mu to feel Ye Qingzi be aroused like this. Although he was as familiar as could be with her, Ye Qingzi would always maintain a conservative and shy heart that every girl had. When they exchanged emotions, she would always be more passive and embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Chu Mu could see that Ye Qingzi really did miss him. It made him feel warm inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even when there was much love, his brain was rarely controlled by his smaller brain. Although Chu Mu often wanted to engage in passionate love with Ye Qingzi, this time was a rare occasion, and he wasn’t overcome with lust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There would be a long time during the night where he could deal with that then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have something good to give you.” Ye Qingzi quietly said with a red face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sobering up, Ye Qingzi wondered if she had been too indulgent just now. She had practically been like a demanding child.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also have a pleasant surprise that I have brought for you.” Chu Mu fiddled with Ye Qingzi’s long hair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For you.” Ye Qingzi took out the Immortal Ghost Stone from her spatial ring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An immortal aura spilled out. &nbsp;The tiny Immortal Ghost Stone in her palm was emitting a dense immortal aura that even shocked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” Chu Mu was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An Immortal Ghost Stone. A first rank Immortal item. It happens to match the attributes of your Ghost King.” said Ye Qingzi with a full smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi stared at Chu Mu’s face. She wanted to see his shock and happiness. This would make her very satisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for some reason, besides the shock and happiness on Chu Mu’s face, she also saw a sliver of other emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t know what it was, nor why Chu Mu briefly avoided her with his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter?” asked Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked at Ye Qingzi, and for a while didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Immortal item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surprise Ye Qingzi had given him was an immortal item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After wandering Wupan Continent, Chu Mu was very clear how precious Immortal items were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Chu Mu hadn’t personally seen Ye Qingzi’s refinement process, he could guess she had spent countless sleepless nights in order to refine this Immortal item. She definitely would have experienced failure after failure while racking her brains…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s nothing.” Chu Mu retracted his guilt, and received the Immortal Ghost Stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t need to act unnatural when Ye Qingzi gave him the items, nor did he even have to say thank you. He just needed to remember it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you come by yourself this time?” Ye Qingzi didn’t ask anything further. She had already seen what she wanted to see.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I’ll take you to see someone.” a smile rose on Chu Mu’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He brought Ye Qingzi out of Divine Mountain, and flew towards the residence Xu Daofeng had given everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The courtyard was a beautiful scenery of green and flowing water. It was a gorgeous residence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that Ning Maner would be in the back garden playing with the small pets. The others weren’t here. Chu Mu brought Ye Qingzi to the back garden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was very curious as to who Chu Mu had brought her to see. Chu Mu wasn’t giving anything away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they arrived in the back garden, the first thing Ye Qingzi saw were azure bamboo leaves. Amidst the bamboo leaves was an absolutely beautiful young woman taking care of a group of adorable small pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young woman seemed to have sensed Chu Mu’s arrival. She stood up, and like a spotlessly white cloud, lifted her skirt as she ran over. Her slender figure radiated youthful energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi briefly went absent-minded. It was hard to believe there was a girl with such a pure temperament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the young woman got closer, a young girl dancing amidst countless Fairy Butterflies appeared in Ye Qingzi’s head. That young girl’s figure slowly merged with the beautiful young woman that was a pure as water in front of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Maner?” Ye Qingzi finally understood, and her face was full of shock and happiness!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was shocked because Ning Maner had become a beauty that could even charm women. She was happy because Ning Maner, who had been taken away by Dark Sky Ocean World people, had come back. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister.” Ning Maner was the same as the past, like a young lady, and threw herself into Ye Qingzi’s embrace. Her smiling eyes now contained an extra layer of haze, formed by grievance and happiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had thought of Ning Maner all this time. Indeed, she had been taken away by others while under her watch. Seeing her safely return, why would she not be excited? In Ye Qingzi’s eyes, Ning Maner was like a younger sister that she dearly loved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“See. Big sister said in the past that when you grew older, you would become a beauty capable of destroying cities. You look so beautiful that it doesn’t even look natural. Even big sister is jealous.” Ye Qingzi pinched Ning Maner’s cheek out of habit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can that be? Big sister is the good looking one,” said Ning Maner with a red face. Ning Maner was speaking the truth though. Ye Qingzi’s body was much better than her own and when she raised her arms, she would exude an irresistible charm. Ning Maner didn’t have any of her reserved charm, mature composure, or graceful warmth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two of them happily talked, melodious laughter that resembled singing voices drifted through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When night arrived, everyone finally returned. Even Mu Qingyi and Xu Daofeng came from Divine Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only person Ye Qingzi could talk to in Divine Sect was Mu Qingyi. But because both of them had to cultivate, they didn’t see each other much. Thus, being able to see this many familiar faces in Zhengming Main City this time made Ye Qingzi feel extremely happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After dinner, everyone had a long conversation before they either went to cultivate or sleep.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That girl really has grown up,” muttered Ye Qingzi with a faint smile as Ning Maner found an excuse to return to her room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi actually thought that Ning Maner wanted to sleep in her room. In the past, this girl would always come and sleep beside her, making Chu Mu depressed, and forcing him to go to one side and cultivate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu waited for Ning Maner to leave. After closing the door, Chu Mu looked with a smile that also was not a smile at Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi knew what he was thinking and her face flushed red. She seemed to remember her indulgent actions this afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw Ye Qingzi’s bashful appearance, Chu Mu’s lust was greatly incited. He originally wanted to tell a few things to her first, but he felt that it was best to have a taste before they spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were many women around him, Chu Mu had only had this experience with Ye Qingzi before. The familiar and extremely alluring feeling made Chu Mu even sure of Ye Qingzi’s spot in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sweat dripped down Ye Qingzi’s forehead as she swept a few strands of hair out of her face. Her cheeks were red, and her eyes were charmingly bashful. Only Chu Mu could see this alluring appearance of Ye Qingzi now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was already very late at night and in the silence, it was possible to see the rough breathing of the two people gradually turn tranquil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu held the sleek and soft beauty tightly in his arms. He could no longer hide the words in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi, I have something to tell you.” earnestly said Chu Mu, albeit nervous in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? About what?” Ye Qingzi rarely heard Chu Mu use this kind of tone. She was smart and sensitive; thus, she quickly guessed it was likely related to why Chu Mu had dodged her eyes during the daytime.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu briefly hesitated before finally saying: “It’s about Princess Jinrou.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh.” Ye Qingzi went silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t want to hide anything from Ye Qingzi. That would erect a barrier in his feelings for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Chu Mu spoke the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know how to lie, nor did he want to lie.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi quietly listened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he spoke and after she listened, the two of them descended into a long silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi? Say something.” Chu Mu broke the silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi lifted her head and stared at Chu Mu. Then, she lowered her head and buried it in Chu Mu’s embrace. Softly, she said: “I expected it to be like this…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. Ye Qingzi had guessed this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, do you know you have a habit of sleep talking?” softly said Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sleep talking?” Chu Mu looked confusedly at Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Often when you’re in a deep sleep, I’ll be startled awake by your sleeping voice,” muttered Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, the truth is that I’ve always wanted to ask you whether, in your dreams, you’ve returned countless times to Immortal City’s Dormant World. Whether you see Princess Jinrou die in front of you time after time, and watch her fall into the pool of blood…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s words stunned Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene on Mysterious Demon Mountain was firmly engraved in Chu Mu’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fanned out long black hair, the final unwilling and fondly recollecting gaze, and the conspicuous red blood flowing on the ground…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had fallen into the pool of blood. It was so beautiful it was stifling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had tried to hide it and pretend he was sorry for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in his dreams and in his subconsciousness, those feelings were laid bare. It was so painful that he found it hard to breathe!&nbsp;</span></p>
