 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>The dense forest and enormous trees that reached the skies were left behind by Chu Mu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As they flew through Quiet Forest, Night displayed its powerful agility when passing through forest and jungle terrain. Although there were obstructions everywhere in the forest, it was still able to continuously speed up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The outer and middle ring of Quiet Forest was like an enormous labyrinth. If the invaders didn’t know how to navigate through it themselves, they would inevitably keep walking in a circle in the forest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Chu Mu entered Quiet Forest, he was at a loss and had lost his sense of direction. For some reason, everywhere he ran, there would always be some Colorful Sparrows. These Colorful Sparrows acted as a good guide and prevented him from taking too many wrong paths.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Zhi zhi~~~~~~~ Zhi zhi~~~~~~~” the surrounding Colorful Sparrows let out panicked cries. Before Chu Mu had even reacted, these Colorful Sparrows all dispersed and flew into different treetops to hide away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Many small creatures had powerful perceptive abilities of danger. This meant that they had sensed danger in front that caused them to fly away in a panic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu didn’t have Night stop, and he sent out his soul remembrance to scout.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A short distance ahead, in a dark blue forest, Chu Mu felt energy pulses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Clearly, there was a fight ahead!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu had Night enter its stealth mode and stealthily moved forwards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The energy pulses grew increasingly strong and eventually, a concentrated aura of destruction greeted Chu Mu’s face, displaying the forest destruction ahead of him. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Countless squirming purple lightning bolts interweaved as lightning bolts struck the scorched earth. A Thunder Giant boundlessly and majestically stood there, its two hands clutching flickering lightning halberds!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Facing off against this Thunder Giant was a Spectral Bird. On the back of this Spectral Bird was a white-clothed man. This white-clothed man steered the Spectral Bird agilely around the Thunder Giant’s lightning.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Zheng Wu, aren’t you being too despicable?! You sold the information to this many people?!” the soul pet trainer on the Thunder Giant angrily roared.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The truth is that your Elemental Sect was just the last one to obtain the information. Your Helm Lord Guo had best move faster, otherwise, that young lady will be taken away by Kang Ruodong, Xu Kuan, Huo Lei, and the others.” Zheng Wu stood the Spectral Bird’s back and spoke neither hurriedly or slowly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your actions won’t let anyone obtain benefits?!” said the soul pet trainer on the Thunder Giant.</p>
 <p>“Since you’re going to die anyway, there’s no harm in telling you that I, Zheng Wu, want the Messiah Tree Seed!” said Zheng Wu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You? You haven’t even reached the immortal rank. In front of Kang Ruodong, Xu Kuan, Huo Lei, and Helm Lord Guo, you’re insignificant!” said the soul pet trainer on the Thunder Giant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s right. I indeed cannot defeat them, But do you really think that I divulged the information to all of them just so they could equally split the Messiah Tree Seed?” laughed Zheng Wu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“In your dreams!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zheng Wu didn’t say anything more. The Spectral Bird he was riding on suddenly disappeared in the purple lightning.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the next instant, it appeared to the side of the Thunder Giant and ten spectral blades morphed out from its body!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Shua!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Ten spectral blades simultaneously streaked past the Thunder Giant’s body. Its already wounded body was unable to react at all and its enormous lightning body was sliced open!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Elemental Sect soul pet trainer standing on the Thunder Giant wasn’t able to escape either. His body was sliced into two pieces and fresh blood spurted out.</p>
 <p>The attack was terrifyingly beautiful and Chu Mu who was watching from a distance felt a shock in his heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If he was right, the Thunder Giant was a peak dominator rank. Therefore, the Spectral Bird had to be much stronger than the Thunder Giant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was no wonder the people who had come to New Moon Land from Dark Sky Ocean World had respected Border Commander Zheng Wu like that. Zheng Wu’s strength could have easily swept through New Moon Land back then. Moreover, he would have been able to do so with ease.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu was still hiding to the side, not making any noise. It wasn’t that he was afraid of him, but he didn’t have too much time right now to tangle with others.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zheng Wu didn’t to dally here and rode on his Spectral Bird even deeper into Quiet Forest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu watched Zheng Wu leave, and roughly understood what was going on.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zheng Wu had probably sold the information about Ning Maner coming to Quiet Forest to many factions. Those people that desired the Messiah Tree Seed began to mobilize, and this included Divine Sect, Demon Beast Palace, and Elemental Sect…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This Zheng Wu is quite ambitious. He wants to take the Messiah Tree Seed while the many factions are fighting for it.” silently said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not long after he left, Chu Mu continued towards Ning Maner. From the words Zheng Wu had just said, the first one to arrive in the inner part of Quiet Forest was Kang Ruodong.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong was the leader of those who chased Ning Maner in the past. His methods were extremely merciless, and if Ning Maner didn’t hand over the Messiah Tree Seed, the consequences were unthinkable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I hope Third White will be able to find Ning Maner before Kang Ruodong does.” silently prayed Chu Mu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Given where Chu Mu was at right now, he had definitely arrived later than a few people. He could only hope that Quiet Forest’s protectors would be able to delay for some time so that Third White would be able to catch up to Ning Maner and protect her. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Night, let’s go!” Chu Mu patted Night’s dream horn and spoke to it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Night strode forward. The night pursuit effects under its feet still remained, and it was able to instantly reach its highest speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Night transformed into a dark streak of light. But before it had gone far, a person suddenly appeared in front of Chu Mu!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu creased his brows. This person was Zheng Wu, who had just left.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It turned out he hadn’t just left. Instead, he was waiting ahead for him. Chu Mu was curious. How did this fellow discover Night which had incredibly high concealing abilities?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Friend, isn’t it rude to secretly listen to others?” Zheng Wu stood in front of Chu Mu and looked at Chu Mu with a bit of amusement.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu looked back at Zheng Wu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zheng Wu was wearing white clothing. He was tall and had a martial appearance, as well as fair skin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Dream Beast’s concealment abilities are very strong. Although my Spectral Bird innately has the most powerful perception abilities - so much so that it's difficult for even immortal rank creatures to hide - your Dream Beast nearly escaped its perception… but since we’ve run into each other now, why don’t you tell me your name.” continued Zheng Wu. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu originally didn’t want to tangle with Zheng Wu for now. But who expected his soul pet to be so special…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at Zheng Wu’s attitude, he clearly wasn’t planning on letting him go.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I initially didn’t have the time to kill you…” Chu Mu’s eyes gradually turned cold and killing intent was slowly released from his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A long time ago Chu Mu had said he was absolutely going to force Zheng Wu to raise his head to look at him!&nbsp;</p>
