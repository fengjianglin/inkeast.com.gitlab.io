 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, a gorgeous sun descended. The golden light illuminated the surroundings, gorgeous lighting everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden flaming figure beat its wings and circled above the bridge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person riding on the golden phoenix was Mu Qingyi. She was presently cautiously watching the purple long haired woman at the end of the bridge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was riding with Mu Qingyi. Chu Mu glanced up at these two women. He knew that they were worried for him and had braved through danger to break out of the army encirclement to come there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingyi, wait…” Ye Qingzi saw that Mu Qingyi was planning on flying down to help Chu Mu, but told her to stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi looked confusedly at Ye Qingzi. The one controlling the Flower Demon Empire was definitely Empress Concubine Chu Xi. Only by getting rid of her as fast as possible could the people from the Three Great Palaces successfully retreat. If things were dragged on, and the Flower Demon Army appeared, the situation could very well reverse itself. Indeed, the power of the Flower Demon Army from back then had been personally witnessed by Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let him deal with it himself.” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had heard Chu Mu speak about the humiliation he suffered from his first pet a long time ago. Chu Mu, with his unrelenting effort, probably had always been waiting for the day he would be able to step on this defector woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a battle that Chu Mu had to fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was destiny between Chu Mu and his defector soul pet. Ye Qingzi believed that Chu Mu wanted to use his own strength to retrieve his dignity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi watched the blood-clothed man, and the purple dress woman standing on the bridge. From their expressions, she could see that the grievances between the two were not just ordinarily deep. It even seemed to reach an irreconcilable extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi remembered when she teased him about the two of them having the “Chu” surname. Now looking at them, she was extremely shocked in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What grievances do they have between them?” Mu Qingyi looked at Ye Qingzi, hoping for an answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu wu hu hu hu~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An ice-cold violent wind swept its way over. Ye Qingzi was about to answer when she turned around and found that Wu Kuang and Lian Yan had already caught up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far away, the Icy Death King circled around and the Steel Eagle King were flying side by side. The two men were looking fearfully at Chu Mu and only dared to fly above the bridge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your majesty, you’re fine, right?” the two of them asked. Their voices contained traces of flattery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress Concubine didn’t answer them. Her eyes remained fixated on Chu Mu with coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flower vines on the wooden railings began to slowly move. The defector woman took a step forward and instantly, the flower sprays began to extend outwards towards Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her mind was able to control any flower type plant at will. Moreover, all of these flower type plants had been planted where nobody knew, and would mysteriously grow and blossom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her aura also contained enormous life force and wherever she went, all living things would feel recovered and filled with life. Moreover, all living things would serve her, becoming a devoted soldier, listening to their queen’s orders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the time in Xiangrong City, she had grown much stronger, and the power she possessed had become even stranger and mysterious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress Concubine ignored those two men and continued to slowly walk towards Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You simply don’t understand anything, yet still barge straight through like a madman, ruining my plans and obstructing my matters…” the original calm in the defector woman’s eyes slowly turned to ice cold and anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flowers began to move faster, and Chu Mu could even feel the sprays behind him in the grand palace restlessly move!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now, you are nothing more than someone who managed to climb out of a well with a spurt of energy. You don’t realize that the sky is even higher than you can see!” the defector woman pressed closer step by step. Her voice was abnormally cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment her voice faded, countless dancing sprays appeared on the immortal bridge. Like colorful enormous dragons, they wildly danced around the bridge in the skies!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each one of the holy blue-colored death flowers emitting dangerous auras blossomed. These holy flowers didn’t have malevolent and sharp teeth, nor did they have imposing eyes. However, they were much more terrifying than savage beasts!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the deathly flower domain was released, Chu Mu, who was covered in fresh blood, continued to stand there. The defector woman’s overbearing and contemptuous attitude made Chu Mu think of Tianxia City, when her puppet had spoken to him with that attitude. Indeed, that puppet was a genuine illumination of this woman’s heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s expression was very calm, but Son of Heaven Wu Kuang and Hero Aide Lian Yan were both shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had hastily rushed over in order to protect the outstanding Flower Queen. However, they presently felt that the aura on her was stronger than theirs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until now, either Xia Zhixian or Hero Chief Yuan Sui had accompanied Empress Concubine Chu Xi. Practically everyone believed that Empress Concubine only had a special ability to control flowers, but no fighting strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when they felt the dangerous flower aura, these two men who had planned on flattering and currying favors felt quite a bit of disbelief!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman who looked as if she would seem very sad over the death of an ant was now emitting such a terrifying aura!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the golden phoenix, Mu Qingyi also showed shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until now, she had been crowned as humanity’s strongest female soul pet trainer. Even she had believed in this. How would she expect the Empress Concubine Chu Xi to be able to make her heart palpitate merely by releasing her aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This woman has hidden herself too deeply!” Mu Qingyi took in a deep breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had obviously witnessed the power of the defector woman. Only, she felt that this defector woman was much stronger than in Xiangrong City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you ask me how Chu Mu’s first, second, third ,and fourth souls were lost?” softly asked Ye Qingzi. She began to say what she was going to say before being interrupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi nodded her head. Chu Mu’s lost souls were something Mu Qingyi had always been confused about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was after knowing Chu Mu’s identity as Tianxia’s King that she came to know Chu Mu had three soul pets scattered in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of these three soul pets, the first one to return was the Warbeast Mo Ye. It had powerfully defeated Son of Heaven Wu Kuang’s Icy Death King and killed the Fighting Heaven Horned Beast King. Mu Qingyi had witnessed this, and the shock from that fight was still deeply imprinted in Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second to return was the dragon that Chu Mu had mentioned before. Mu Qingyi thought that it was a Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, but after learning it was an offspring of an Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, she had let out a slight sigh of relief. She thought that if Chu Mu had an Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, his strength would be too terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what she never expected that Little Hidden Dragon who returned was even more terrifying than Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon. With a single technique, it instakilled Fourth Hero Mo Ling’s Tai Mountain Giant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the third soul pet, Ye Qingzi had mentioned it was a Night Thunder Dream Beast that was still probably wandering in the wild. It would be difficult for it to return for the time being.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Mu’s soul pets gradually returned, Mu Qingyi felt continuous shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, she realized something very strange: Chu Mu clearly had five souls ,and if he kept one soul on him and three souls were wandering in the wild, that was only a total of four souls. Wasn’t there still one more soul?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi had naturally asked Chu Mu this, but Chu Mu had seemed like he didn’t want to answer this. When she had inquired with Ye Qingzi, Ye Qingzi had also seemed hesitant. She told her that this matter was a bit complicated, and didn’t say anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, from Ye Qingzi’s words, it seemed that she was going to explain how the first soul was lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Mu Qingyi was unable to figure out how the first soul had anything to do with Empress Concubine Chu Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu’s first soul has actually always been occupied, but he’s been unable to summon it.” Ye Qingzi finally said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Occupied? A defector soul pet?” Mu Qingyi’s reaction was very fast, and she instantly guessed this possibility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it defected not long after he stepped into the soul pet trainer realm. It has always occupied his first soul, almost preventing him from becoming a soul pet trainer.” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet trainer’s first soul was very important. If it defected at the very beginning, then the soul pet trainer which needed to rely on soul pets to increase their soul remembrance would have extreme difficulty climbing up the ranks. There was a high chance they would become a useless person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi was extremely shocked to learn that Chu Mu’s first pet had defected the moment he had stepped into the soul pet trainer realm. Thus, this meant that Chu Mu had spent much more effort than normal people to reach where he was today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could his defector soul pet be related to Empress Concubine Chu Xi?” asked Mu QIngyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not related…” Ye Qingzi shook her head and pointed at the purple hair and purple dressed, beautiful woman on the immortal bridge and said: “The defector soul pet is her!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi was stunned and questioned whether she had heard incorrectly. She asked: “You’re saying that Empress Concubine Chu Xi is Chu Mu’s soul pet?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She… she is a person. How… how could she sign a soul pact with a soul pet trainer?” Mu Qingyi bitterly laughed and naturally didn’t believe it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A human type soul pet? Didn’t these normally only appear in children's stories?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from the Empress Concubine Chu Xi possessing a few flower type soul techniques, no matter from which angle you looked, she was exactly the same as a normal human. How could she be a soul pet?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mover, how could there be such a human soul pet with looks that neared a demoness and with terrifying intellect?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingyi, you aren’t joking, right? Empress Concubine Chu Xi is Chu Mu’s soul pet…” said Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, when Ye QIngzi learned of this herself, she also was in slight disbelief. Only, whether this was reality or not would quickly be disclosed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi and Mu Qingyi’s discussion had been spoken aloud. Son of Heaven Wu Kuang and Hero Aide Lian Yan could both hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truly a bunch of rubbish. If you continue using these words to slander our Flower Queen, I, Wu Kuang, will be the first to not let you off!” at this moment, Wu Kuang roared with a red face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of a joke was this? The perfect goddess Empress Concubine was Chu Fangchen’s soul pet??&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Kuang and Lian Yan had both heard preposterous stories, but never heard a story this preposterous!!&nbsp;</span></p>
