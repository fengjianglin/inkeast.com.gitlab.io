The black wind stream began to rapidly expand, transforming into several wind sickles that could rip apart space. They then eerily and disorderly flew at the White Nightmare!</span></p>

The accuracy of its wind sickles was exceptionally high and although the White Nightmare used a evasive technique, its white devil flame body was soon torn by a deep cut!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon suffering a wound, the White Nightmare’s eyes changed, and gradually began to show fury towards the Fierce Wind Demon Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>

Chu Mu naturally wouldn’t let it fight for too long, and as he brought the Binding Wind Spirit out of the clutches of the Fierce Wind Demons, he immediately called the White Nightmare back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Night Dance!’</span></p>

However, the Night Thunder Dream Beast had already run far away and the Fierce Wind Demon Lord ultimately was unable to chase after its tracks in the darkness.</span></p>

It will allow your wounds to recover faster.” Chu Mu retrieved a few eighth rank medicines from his spatial ring and gave them to the Binding Wind Spirit to take.</span></p>

Its eyes were somewhat limpid as it took the eighth rank medicines before it dispiritedly lay on the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>

There practically was no part of its skin that was completely unscathed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">New wounds crossed over with old wounds. They covered the Binding Wind Spirit’s tiny body. It was hard to imagine how many fights the Binding Wind Spirit had experienced in these two months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no point to your fighting method. There will finally come a day where you will die a miserable death at the hands of the Fierce Wind Demons.” Chu Mu spoke to the Binding Wind Spirit in his own language.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fierce Wind Demon Empire was precisely the one that had attacked the Binding Wind Spirit Tribe. Given that it was a Soul Pet Empire, the strength of one Binding Wind Spirit, no matter the case, could not take revenge for its tribe. Right now, the only thing the Binding Wind Spirit was numbly killing a few of the Fierce Wind Demon Empire’s Fierce Wind Demons. All this amounted to was a form of self-destruction and disencumberment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Wind Spirit didn’t communicate back to Chu Mu. It sat there, numbly, as if it had lost its soul….&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the Binding Wind Spirit like this, Chu Mu’s expression slightly changed. He knew that there was no point in speaking with the Binding Wind Spirit. He promptly stood up and jumped onto the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only then that the Binding Wind Spirit faintly lifted its head. Its slightly vacuous eyes glanced at Chu Mu, as if it was curious why this human would immediately leave after saving it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two months ago, the Binding Wind Spirit had embarked on a one man struggle, and had since killed hundreds or thousands of Fierce Wind Demons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even it knew how incomparably large the Fierce Wind Demon Empire was. No matter how much it killed, it could not truly annihilate these enemies of its tribe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Wind Spirit needed Chu Mu’s help. When Chu Mu had just appeared and saved it, the Binding Wind Spirit’s heart had been touched. If this human had used a soul pact on it then, relying on the extremely weak soul link, there was a chance that the Binding Wind Spirit would have accepted the soul pact. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Wind Spirit had already seen the revenge buried in the very depths of its heart. It wanted to destroy the Fierce Wind Demon Empire which had caused it to lose everything. It knew that after it signed a soul pact with a human, its soul would certainly be enslaved; however, the Binding Wind Spirit believed that it wouldn’t forget its mission. It believed that this human would allow it to grow stronger and someday in the future, he would also be able to help it fully overthrow the Fierce Wind Demon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, this human had left. The Binding Wind Spirit was a bit disappointed, because it was now going to have to face the Fierce Wind Legion that numbered in the millions by itself again. It would listlessly fight bruised and battered in this windy world and eventually meet its tragic demise in some corner of this windy world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Wind Spirit sat there. Its pupils became spiritless and limpid again, as it merely sat there, slowly recovering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effects of eighth rank healing medicine were outstanding. The Binding Wind Spirit didn’t know how long it had stayed there for. When it had the strength to, it stood up and began to manipulate the power of the wind. It formed a perception wind ring around it that allowed it to detect every abnormal movement in the wind currents fifty meters around it. This prevented any creature harboring intents towards it from approaching it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the healing Binding Wind Spirit sensed a slight abnormality in the air. It was as if there was some dark energy that had outlandishly passed through its all-knowing wind ring and was quickly approaching it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wind energy around the Binding Wind Spirit began to turn tempestuous as it used its mind to control the wind energy. It began to chant in incantation and it only needed to lock onto the soul pet that had infiltrated its way in before it could launch an attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the enemy appeared. The Binding Wind Spirit had already prepared; it guessed that it had probably been the ninth phase Fierce Wind Demon Lord that infiltrated its way in. Thus, this time, the Binding Wind Spirit ignored its wounds and immediately chanted a high rank wind type technique - a ninth rank wind type technique!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hu hu hu hu~~~~~~” the ninth rank wind type technique had already been prepared and there were several beginnings of hurricanes that could be seen on the ground. All that needed to be done was for the incantation to finish and the powerful ninth rank hurricanes would rip this area of about a hundred meters to destruction!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s me, don’t be nervous.” suddenly, the voice of a human drifted into its mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Wind Spirit quickly sensed the weak soul link with the human, and hastily stopped its ninth rank wind technique...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Binding Wind Spirit halted its incantation, the beginnings of the ninth rank hurricanes were suppressed and the wind type destruction aura dissipated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qin~~~~~~~” the Binding Wind Spirit let out a shout as if it was asking Chu Mu why he came back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the Binding Wind Spirit seemed to have sense that this human was different from before. After glancing over this human, it suddenly discovered that several more wounds had appeared on its body. This human looked just like he had engaged in a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t only the human. Even the Royal Flame Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, the Night Thunder Dream Beast and the White Nightmare were covered in wounds. Moreover, from the state of their wounds, they were inflicted by wind type techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Wind Spirit’s eyes showed curiosity. It didn’t know why this human had carried wounds back.</span></p>

Ultimately, the Binding Wind Spirit came to slowly understand how insignificant it was to the entire Fierce Wind Empire.

It could no longer suppress the two months of sorrow it had amassed. Its falsified display of persistence completely collapsed and sparkling tears began to slide down its face from the corner of its eyes...</span></p>
