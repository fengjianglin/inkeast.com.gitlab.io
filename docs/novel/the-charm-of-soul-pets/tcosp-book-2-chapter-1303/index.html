 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had a preconceived notion in his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was, regardless of how many factions there were in the huge outside world or how many experts there were, Divine Sect would forever be the most authoritative. When any faction talked about Divine Sect, including huge factions like Wupan Navy, they would be respectful and would not do things they did not permit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, despite Divine Sect’s power, it remained silent in this matter. So what kind of abilities did these criminals who caused such a disturbance in Quiet Forest have in order for Divine Sect to not dare rashly punish them?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What on earth happened? Did someone steal all of the resources of Quiet Forest?” asked Pang Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The resources being taken is negligible. The biggest problem is that the world’s only messiah Tree has died.” Xuan Teacher Sun’s voice was low as he continued: “In the past, the big species all committed a crime, causing the Messiah Trees to gradually disappear from this world. And now, the final Messiah Tree has been ended by people with insatiable greed. The agreement the big species made was simply a joke.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Sun’s words were very heavy and his extreme anger towards the actions of these people could be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, most of the people denouncing these criminals were xuan teachers because xuan teachers knew best that the world’s spirit, xuan and immortal items were inextricably tied to the Messiah Tree’s nurturing. By killing the Messiah Tree, these criminals were acting purely for short term profit because many rare resources could die out because of the Messiah Tree’s disappearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t understand. Since the Messiah Tree was gradually unable to satisfy the requirements of the various large species, why would some human leaders defy an ancient crime spanning thousands of years and break into Quiet Forest, then kill the Messiah Tree?” asked Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, ignorant!” Xuan Teacher Sun immediately sneered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued: “Do you know how many creatures the Messiah Tree can nurture? Ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million? Of course not! The number of creatures and resources a Messiah Tree can nurture can be described in the hundreds of millions. If its enormous energy is to be poured into a single creature’s body, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a god rank creature will pretty much be born in the next 100 years!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“God rank?” Pang Yue blinked her eyes, not really understanding what rank god rank was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Xun threw a glance at Pang Yue, but didn’t respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But doesn’t that mean Quiet Forest also has these god rank creatures? How did these people manage to succeed?” asked Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quiet Forest has numerous creatures in it. The nurturing energy the Messiah Tree has is thus given to many creatures, including those that don’t protect it. In fact, those creatures that aren’t protecting it occupy the majority of the energy given. When the calamity arrived, none of those creatures took action. This comes back to what I said before. The reason why the Messiah Trees went extinct was because it was purely a godly offering tree. It didn’t have any ambitions. Although there were those that protected it, these protectors were ultimately unable to block such a huge group of thieves.” said Xuan Teacher Sun. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then how many people participated in this event?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Sun shook his head and said: “I only know how many people died, not how many people participated. They were greedy, but they also paid a painful price. Many were forever left in Quiet Forest by the Messiah Tree’s protectors.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, a bitter expression appeared on Xuan Teacher Sun’s mouth for some reason.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ye Wansheng, Pang Yue and Chao Lengchuan were shocked by Xuan Teacher Sun’s words, this matter ultimately had nothing to do with them. They wouldn’t get too emotional over this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu’s heart was in turmoil. He had already guessed Ning Maner’s matter could be very complex. But he never expected it to reach this level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a young woman blessed by the Messiah Tree. Now that the last Messiah Tree had disappeared, she who inherited its powers would have a very important mission resting on her feeble shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu still remembered the two scenes of Ning Maner feebly hiding and crying in his embrace during a windy and rainy night, as well as when the sun was out and she was faintly smiling and dancing around him like a fairy butterfly. When he realized this matter was connected to the ending of a species, Chu Mu felt more compelled to see her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, I’ve probably fulfilled your curiosity. Xiao Xiao, you’re not young anymore. You should have your own thoughts. Pay more attention when others tell you to do things. Don’t always rashly charge forwards otherwise you’ll only end up running to your own death.” Xuan Teacher Sun spoke with wisdom and sincerity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I understand.” Xiao Xiao nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Sun knew that his niece still needed more training in order to understand more things. He looked at the four of them and said: “Everything is good about my niece and she’s beautiful. It’s just that her thoughts are a bit simple or even a bit stupid. You are all Xiao Xiao’s friends and seeing as your experience is much more plentiful than her’s, please look after her in the future.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not a problem” immediately answered Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As a thanks for saving my niece and for looking after her in the future, I’ll only accept a fee for collecting the materials for your xuan item this time. Keep the rest of the xuan. It’s not easy for young people to make their way in this world.” Xuan Teacher Sun stood up. He didn’t wait for the four of them to thank him before he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? Thank you Uncle Sun.” Xiao Xiao hastily called out after him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao knew that most xuan teachers had a common problem: even if they had to concoct for the closest of people, they would still have to charge the same price. This 140 thousand xuan exchange would wear away at a huge portion of Xuan Teacher Xun’s mental strength. This was mental strength that others would have to line up for even if they wanted to buy it. It was very rare for Xuan Teacher Sun to be so generous. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you thanking me for? Don’t cause any more trouble, otherwise how will I be able to explain it to your father?” Xuan Teacher Sun waved his hand and his body gradually faded outside the forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Xuan Teacher Sun left, Xiao Xiao’s eyes immediately craftily swept over the four of them. With a bit of excitement, she said: “Did you just hear what my uncle said? Those people are trying to find the location of the Messiah Tree’s seed!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes… wait what?” Prince Chao’s reaction was half a beat slow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If they can search for it, why can’t we? That’s the Messiah Tree’s seed. If we cultivate it, we will have the world’s only Messiah Tree and we’ll be able to obtain extremely powerful soul pets!” Xiao Xiao’s expression was full of excitement as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Chu Mu was instantly speechless when he looked at Xiao Xiao’s actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that Xuan Teacher Sun’s words had gone in one ear and gone out the other. This lady simply didn’t understand that this matter wasn’t something they should be interfering with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ask Chu Mu, he’s our leader.” said Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, Chu Mu, I actually happen to have a pretty good lead on this. If we were to actually stumble across the Messiah Tree seed…” Xiao Xiao looked full of hope at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think we’d best leave it. Just now Xuan Teacher Sun just said that those people are extremely strong. So strong that a single one of their hands can cover the sky. If we were to brashly interfere…” conservatively said Pang Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, hurry and make a decision.” Xiao Xiao ignored Pang Yue’s opinion. It seemed like she was already part of their group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s do it” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Pang Yue was instantly rendered speechless by the frankness of his response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu wouldn’t listen to her because he actually thought she was like Ye Qingzi, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s perfect. I’ll go and inquire about more information and then we can go out to look for the Messiah Tree seed.” Xiao Xiao’s face was full of smiles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu agreed to Xiao Xiao not because she looked like Ye Qingzi, but because Chu Mu was respecting his promise to a young woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
