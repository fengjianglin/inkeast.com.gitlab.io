 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many things were discussed on the first day. Most of them centered around large events that affected the development of the entire Human species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan was quietly astonished during this first conference because often times when Family Master Ning asked whether anyone opposed to something, it meant that a city or a region would be obliterated!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were innocent people there, but in order to prevent more innocent people from being affected, the first group of innocent people would be obliterated and disappear from this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One example was the Wupan Bug Plague discussed earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Family Masters decided to send an army to Wupan Continent’s plagued areas and cleanse them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a huge number of infected people so if this method was adopted, who knew how many people would die!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan’s heart was pure and kind. When she thought of the merciless acts the army would commit upon the infected, she had a wish that Yu Suo would truly be able to cure the numerous infected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every matter discussed by the family masters occurred within the past 20 years, but there were also a few hidden dangers left from before 20 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Take for instance the Ogre King on Flying Mountain. Every once in a while,the Ogre King would appear in a human city and eat humans alive. There were countless people who had perished under its teeth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This horrifying matter had been occurring for a hundred years now. Zhengming Continent’s central history recorded every time a bloody event like this happened and according to the records, the Ogre King had yet to be gotten rid of.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the one hand, the Ogre King was extremely strong. On the other hand, this monster was very elusive and it was impossible to find its habitat. Just two years ago, humans were eaten again and this created a stir in the central part of Zhengming Continent, instilling fear in the people there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really never would have expected this… in the information they sent out earlier, they said it was a disaster. Who would have thought it was an Ogre King hiding in human territory.” said an independent territory representative sitting next to Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had heard a bit about this before. The information that was sent out had called this a disaster. Therefore, this matter had probably been concealed by someone. Only when they arrived at Dual Earth Mountain Conference did she finally learn about the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now we are going to talk about Northern Territory’s matters,” Hidden Pupil Royalty’s old family master spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is the administrator of Northern Territory?” asked this old family master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan felt a bit puzzled. Although Northern Territory was large, there was no reason to talk about it in Dual Earth Mountain, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan gave a light bow, indicating to this old family master that Northern Territory was under the administration of New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Northern Territory had been a land of treasures which the various factions of Zhengming Continent had fought over. Ultimately, it was decided that the Outstanding Experts Competition’s rankings would decide how the territory was partitioned. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had obtained first place in that competition so New Moon Land had become the largest administrator of Northern Territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nearby the Northern Territory is a Flower species world. The Flower species has sent an envoy to express that a few flower subspecies in their world have been continuously dying. They pushing the blame onto us humans and want to retaliate. Therefore, we must build a stronghold defense on the northern side of Northern Territory. Following the discussion between our two great royal families, we have decided to take back Northern Territory and divide the border defense and defensive construction between the large factions.” said the Hidden Pupil family master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old family master’s tone was very tough as if he was giving an order. There was no room to discuss this!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Binglan heard this, she felt an indescribable wave of anger!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Northern Territory was now under the private control of New Moon Land and was renting various areas of the territory to other factions. Thus, the Hidden Pupil family master’s words were explicitly handing over the landlord’s territory to these renters. What difference was this from stealing it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If New Moon Land’s representative has no other complaints, please sign your name here,” said Hidden Pupil’s old family master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This old man didn’t give Liu Binglan any chance to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan could even see Madam Huo, Wind Faction’s Faction Lord, Wang Kuan, Ruan Le,i and many other factions that excluded New Moon Land show smiles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These fellows ostensibly had been waiting for this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Northern Territory is our New Moon Land’s private territory. Why must we partition it to all factions? I object to this.” Liu Binglan’s tone was very resolute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just said that the Flower species world’s subspecies wishes to retaliate against us humans. The Flower species envoy has already warned me of this. The Northern Territory is an excellent defensive line and there must be adequate defensive abilities there. Therefore, this expropriation is in the consideration of all of the citizens in Zhengming Continent’s northern side.” said the Hidden Pupil old family master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Expropriation? What different is this from annexation?” coldly said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had already felt that this was unadorned targeting!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They wanted to annex the things that originally belonged to New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Binglan, please watch your tone. Understand who you’re talking to!” Madam Huo spoke out at a very timely moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must understand that any matter discussed in the Dual Earth Conference has no room for individualistic or individual faction ideas. We cannot allow the lives of Zhengming Continent’s northern citizens to fall into danger because your New Moon Land needs to obtain a large amount of revenue and resources from Northern Territory. We will permit an objection, but the final decision will be made by everyone here.” Hidden Pupil Royalty’s old family master calmly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan’s heart sank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Decided by everyone here?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Land didn’t have many allies now. &nbsp;Even if this decision wasn’t made by a vote, she still knew what the outcome would be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This matter was essentially a foregone conclusion. Liu Binglan could see Madam Huo and that area mockingly smile at her. It seemed that she already knew that things were going to turn out like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan wanted to say something, but what could she say now?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the vote was cast, out of 200 people, 170 people agreed with the old family master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the greedy vote, Liu Binglan suddenly felt powerless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously she had sensed the hidden exchanges and the targeting within these exchanges. However, she never expected that the Northern Territory’s matters would be placed in Dual Earth Conference and for it to be forcibly annexed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Family Master Gu, I have an objection.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When things seemed to have collapsed, this was the only person aside from Liu Binglan who voiced opposition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should add a time limit of one year. After one year, the territory should go back to its owner.” a man’s voice rung out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan looked over and discovered that the person speaking was Divine Sect’s leader, Xiao Xueang, seating in a decision making seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Magistrate Xiao, why are you opposing this? As Divine Sect’s magistrate, could you be hoping to see Zhengming Continent’s northern side suffer a disaster?” said Old Family Master Gu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can annex the territory, but you should add a limit of one year. Once the year is over, you should return the territory, untouched, back to the territory owner.” calmly said Xiao Xueang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A time limit? But how will we know how long the retaliating flower species will last?” said Xuan Gate Immortal Sect’s Gu Xisha.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“By that time, the defenses will already have been formed, and it will be the same regardless of who is administering the area. So why should we not return it to its original owner?” said Xiao Xueang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also feel that we should add a time limit. The owner of the annexed territory has already graciously contributed their precious territory. They are the greatest contributors, and they are worthy of respect and thanks. Once the danger is over, the territory should naturally go back to its original owner.” on the family master seats, the family master with the white streaks finally spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time this Hidden Pupil Royalty family master spoke in the conference.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides a few responses when voting, he had spent most of the time like a spectator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Family Master Tao’s words are reasonable.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I also feel like it should be like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Hidden Pupil Royalty’s Old Family Master Gu saw many people agreeing with Magistrate Xiao and Family Master Gu’s words, he said: “Then let’s add a time limit. I’ll have someone edit the agreement, and send it to New Moon Land’s representative’s villa. Let’s do it like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan knew that her words had no weight in this conference and could only remain silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Female Supreme Liu, I can only help you this much.” Xiao Xueang turned and glanced at Liu Binglan as he used a mental voice to speak to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you very much.” Liu Binglan appreciatively looked at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang standing up for her had indeed been a great help to New Moon Land. Otherwise, New Moon Land’s Northern Territory would be inexplicably partitioned by those other people and permanently belong to them. This would have been a heavy blow on New Moon Land’s development. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, Xiao Xuehan had still decided to stand up for New Moon Land even when the votes were overwhelmingly against him. This Chief Magistrate had inevitably offended a few people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once this matter was decided, Liu Binglan was deeply worried when she noticed Yu Suo looking at her as if she wanted to say something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This could only be a small wave. Tomorrow’s discussion will be about even larger things. If I haven’t guessed incorrectly, they will probably have an even fiercer offensive.” Yu Suo used a mental voice to speak to Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What will it be?” Liu Binglan’s heart sank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now I’ve pretty much guessed who the person inciting people to target New Moon Land is. However, I don’t know what kind of method he’ll use to deal with us. There were 170 people against us in this vote, but because I knew that we wouldn’t be able to emerge victorious in this matter, I had a portion of my people vote against us.” said Yu Suo. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How many people do you have?” asked Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vote numbers was the most direct method of determining how many allies and enemies New Moon Land currently had. The overwhelmingly one-sided circumstances was something Liu Binglan never expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not many, but also not few. Let’s see in tomorrow’s conference. The enemy’s attack has been fierce this time. If the situation is not good tomorrow, my people will still choose to vote against us. There will be no need for you to fight back either. While New Mon Land has a few abilities, it ultimately is not the opponent of these large factions. Give up the things we can give up and save the things we need to save.” said Yu Suo.&nbsp;</span></p>
