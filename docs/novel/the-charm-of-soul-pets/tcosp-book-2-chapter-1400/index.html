 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Counting the time, Chu Mu had been guarding for a total of seven days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie was still in the process recovering, White Devil was also exhausted and it would take a long time to rest before it was able to join the battle again. Zhan Ye could no longer continue fighting. Although Little Hidden Dragon had ranked up after devouring a lot of souls, its stamina was mostly exhausted too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu only had Night, Dead Dream, Ning and Qin left who were still able to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle that had lasted for a whole three days was definitely the most horrifying. White Devil, Zhan Ye and Little Hidden Dragon could be considered to have reached the Immortal rank. It had ended up like this despite their fighting strength. If the next wave was also at such a scale, then Chu Mu would definitely not be able to defend against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I better strengthen Ghost King first,” Chu Mu still felt a little insecure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The creatures in this Imprint Valley did not treasure their lives at all. They were already at Dominator rank or were almost reaching Immortal rank, yet they were stubbornly charging towards their own deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could not be certain if there were any other race eyeing them. Only by raising Ghost King to the Immortal rank could he ensure the strength of the defense in the following battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s soul remembrance was still quite abundant as he did not change his soul pet in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King had not completely recovered yet. Chu Mu had to wait for it to return to its peak state before strengthening it, or he would have be wasting an Immortal item if he were to fail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead Dream scouted from the mountain summit. After seeing Dead Dream, Chu Mu remembered that Yu Suo had mentioned there was a Phoenix race ruin in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, he could only do those other things after the cultivation ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li strolled around the messy battlefield with its short legs. Any valuable item could not escape its eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anything good?” asked Chu Mu when he saw Old Li returning with a smiling face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are many soul crystals. Seven at tenth level, fifteen at ninth level, over a hundred ranging from the eighth to the third rank,” reported Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One soul crystal has a great probability of nurturing a soul pet into a Dominator. New Moon Land had plenty of resources. However, who would dislike the thought of getting more resources? If they could build up a Dominator army ranging a few thousand, this force could truly be of great use during a crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days had passed by without anything happening, Chu Mu was able to take a breather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King had also recovered to its peak state after it rested. Chu Mu decided to act while the iron was still hot and began strengthening Ghost King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal Ghost Stone, this Immortal Item was refined by Ye Qingzi for a long time. It was an extremely meaningful item for him. If he failed, then he really could not explain himself to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting within the formation node, Chu Mu maintained his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Aura within the cultivation formation was of great assistance to him. Chu Mu naturally had to make use of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Closing his eyes, he began inserting his soul remembrance into the Immortal Ghost Stone to get familiar with the energy within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rock type energy was as solid as rock, giving off a hard to approach feeling to it. Meanwhile, ghost type carried traces of a chilling sensation. Chu Mu suspected that if his soul remembrance was not sufficient enough, he might suffer a backlash from this energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let's begin!” Chu Mu concentrated on the Immortal Ghost Stone and began slowly guiding its energy out using his soul remembrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal Aura lingered around and solidified Chu Mu’s soul remembrance. With such an assistance, Chu Mu became more confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The transfer of energy must not be hasty. Chu Mu maintained his stable pace and slowly injected the energy in the Immortal Ghost Stone into Ghost King’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King began absorbing the energy slowly. Ghost King also similarly had to be fully focused in the absorbing process and must not waste too much of the energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first half of the process of the energy absorption was completed smoothly. With the foundation done well, he just had to follow the flow now and he would naturally complete the strengthening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, each time Chu Mu conducted the strengthening process, he would tense up. After all, it would be difficult for him to find another Immortal item suitable for his soul pets if he failed. Although Ning Maner’s Immortal Aura could allow soul pets to evolve by themselves, Chu Mu still had many soul pets. Ning Maner’s current strength made it unable for her to nurture so many soul pets at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Dead Dream flew down from the mountain summit and chirped a warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More Imprint Valley creatures were coming here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not like profanities. However, those creatures just had to come assaulting when he was in the middle of strengthening Ghost King. The timing was just too precise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strengthening took time, especially for a circulating method like this. Chu Mu could not complete Ghost King’s strengthening in a short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he gave up halfway, then it was needless to say that he would definitely fail and the Immortal Ghost Stone would be really wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dead Dream, Qin and Ning, all of you go and hold them back for a while,” Chu Mu told his soul pets using mental voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not summon Night to fight this time. Night had to be kept as the final trump card to handle unexpected situations. After all, if he did not keep an Immortal rank soul pet in reserve in such a dangerous place, then he would really be helpless if he were to encounter a sudden danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead Dream, Qin and Ning entered into their combat stance's. There were not many enemies attacking this time, unlike the previous two waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, amongst the three soul pets this time, only Dead Dream was fairly strong. Qin and Ning were only at the peak Dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi~!” Dead Dream landed next to Chu Mu and told him that there was only one enemy. It seemed to be one which had coincidentally strolled to this place and had followed after the scent of Immortal Aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s its rank?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Near Immortal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead Dream was around two levels weaker than a near Immortal rank creature. Qin and Ning would also have a hard time complementing the difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu really did not want to be interrupted by a random near Immortal rank creature which had accidentally entered this place. After all, Ghost King was going to advance into the near Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead Dream told Chu Mu that it was willing to fight the opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, be careful. Try to stall for time as much as possible, and don’t clash head on,” Chu Mu knew that it was time to test Dead Dream, Qin and Ning. Since they insisted on it, Chu Mu felt that they stood a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Chu Mu was distracted in the conversation with Dead Dream, Qin and Ning, plenty of energy in the Immortal Ghost Stone was lost.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloodsucking Devil Bug was a creature that was especially sensitive to the smell blood. A high rank Bloodsucking Devil Bug could easily smell the stench of blood from thousands of miles away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ability was crucial to them as it depended on sucking blood to strengthen itself.

The blood that had accumulated in there came from thousands of Dominator rank creatures. If it could absorb all the blood, then it could definitely advance into pseudo Immortal rank after digesting it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Near Immortal rank was only one step away from the pseudo Immortal rank.

As it slowly crawled, its enormous body projected a huge shadow on the ground.</span></p>
