 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven horn broke right through the sky. The battlefield had changed from the Hovering Mountain to the sky. Each attack dished out by the Heaven Horn Beast shatters the blue sky just like a mirror!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie continued dodging, but its eyes &nbsp;lit up with purple flames!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Mo Xie’s nine tails had transformed into nine enormous flame dragons, which brilliantly started clashing against the Heaven Horn Beast’s horns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast’s horns were hard and sharp, but the flame dragons were also wild and robust!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the purple energy from the flames clashed against the horns, the Heaven Horn Beast’s unstoppable charge was suddenly halted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Booooom~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine purple dragons elegantly swept across the stage. They perfectly entangled around the Heaven Horn Beast’s most ferocious main horn using their great tenacity. As a result, the fierce charges from it were completely stopped. The Heaven Horn Beat could not push even a single step forward no matter how much strength it exerted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie raised its head and cried out angrily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nine dragons started twisting their bodies and had forcefully lifted the Heaven Horn Beast up into the sky, then they fiercely threw it in the direction of the Hovering Mountain Battlefield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast drew a straight line through the air and crashed heavily into the countless hovering rock piles, breaking right through dozens of Hovering Mountains!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie’s tails could be both soft or hard, they were very effective when fighting against tough creatures like the Heaven Horn Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a flashy dragon tail swing. The damage it had dealt to the Heaven Horn Beast’s internal organs and the bones was quite severe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Heaven Horn Beast got up from among the shattered hovering stone rubble, it kept shaking its head. Although there were no wounds on its body, blood started spilling out from its mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing was utterly dumbfounded by the opponent’s sudden counterattack and he was unable to react immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast had the absolute advantage in offense, so why did it suffer such a heavy counterattack all of a sudden?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It must be a fluke!” Han Erxin gritted his teeth angrily. He would never believe that his Heaven Horn Beast’s attacks contained any form of flaw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The order was given out. After the Heaven Horn Beast recovered from its fall, it charged directly into the sky fiercely once again. Its sharp horns were aimed towards Mo Xie’s abdomen, in an attempt to nail Mo Xie into the blue sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie’s gaze started flickering. The Heaven Horn Beast’s actions were slowed down indefinitely in its eyes. It could clearly see through the weakness that was exposed by its opponent during the assault!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a light sway, Mo Xie started drifting to the side creepily. After it dodged the sharpest charge, its nine tails rapidly started spreading out and transformed into soft flame ribbons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightly passing through the horns, Mo Xie used its tail to wrap properly around the Heaven Horn Beast’s horn root, neck, waist and the four limbs this time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those few body parts were exactly the strength exertion spots. Once they were entangled, the Heaven Horn Beast’s fierce charges would basically be perfectly stopped here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fox Noble Cry. Purple flames shone brightly in Mo Xie’s pupils. A flame diagram started taking shape deep within the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The diagram was projected above the Heaven Horn Beast. Streaks of purple flames criss crossed over one another. The beautiful yet shocking flame sigil opened up a cut with purple flames burning in the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huhuhuhuhuhu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple magma started pouring down from the cut that was made in the sky, becoming a waterfall of magma in the air, mercilessly showering onto the Heaven Horn Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The boiling magma burned the Heaven Horn Beast’s skin. The Heaven Horn Beast could only helplessly endure the painful torture by the boiling magma as it was bound on the spot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature in the entire Hovering Mountain Battlefield started rapidly rising up. The magma was so hot that it would even burn the air itself, let alone the consequences of it touching a creature’s physical body. Even the thickest skin would be melted through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ow!” roared the Heaven Horn Beast madly. It was struggling desperately, trying to break free from Mo Xie’s restraint by making use of the explosive strength that was stimulated by the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Horned beast was a power type creature after all. Mo Xie’s nine tails could not keep it restrained for a long time. After sensing the powerful tearing force through it's tails, Mo Xie released the Heaven Horn Beast from its restraint without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Mo Xie would not let the Heaven Horn Beast go that easily. The moment it's tails were loosened, it jumped directly in front of the Heaven Horn Beast and unleashed a wild Sky Shaking Stamp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Mo Xie’s Sky Shaking Stamp was not as powerful as Zhan Ye’s Warhammer Trample, its purple flames accompanied the Sky Shaking Stamp just like a purple flame pillar from a volcano eruption!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Magma and the flame pillar eruption impacted squarely on the Heaven Horn Beast simultaneously. The Heaven Horn Beast’s face and back were both severely burnt. It did not even dare to open its eyes and hurriedly backed off in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie was still unwilling to let the Heaven Horn Beast go. When the Heaven Horn Beast was retreating, it spat out a ball of flame towards it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ball of flame seemed to be only about one meter big. It only looked like a tiny light dot from the spectator’s view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when the tiny light dot approached the Heaven Horn Beast, it suddenly bloomed into a huge flame lotus in the sky as if a meteor came crashing down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The turbulent flame wave swept down like a tide from the height of a dozen thousand meters. A semi-circular barrier manifested above all the Hovering Mountain spectator seats simultaneously, and blocked the shockwaves from that energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dazzling and the burning flame was even brighter than the sun itself. The spectators only dared to open their eyes after the energy had completely dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All types of powerful attacks could only be gauged by the damage that the opponent had received.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, the Heaven Horn Beast’s attacks were very fierce and wild. Its unrelenting stance did not allow the opponent any chance to recollect itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all it had done in the end was to add a shallow wound on Mo Xie’s flank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Mo Xie’s chained counterattacks after it had grasped onto the opponent’s weakness not only damaged the Heaven Horn Beast’s internal organs, but the heat from the magma and the flames had also charred the Heaven Horn Beast’s skin, riddling it with severe wounds. Both sides went on the offensive, but the damage that each of them had dealt to their opponent was vastly different!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the main Hovering Mountain, Mu Tuan had already become silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gate Master Han also turned quiet and looked expressionless. However, one could tell without thinking too much that he was clearly in a foul mood after seeing his son’s soul pet utterly riddled with wounds after suffering a heavy counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Calm, decisive, sharp observation for weaknesses, superb dodging speed, powerful explosive force, and a terrifying flame sweep. This is a fox that has gathered all the elements of battle in one!” Divine Sect's Old Sect Master Xiao stroked his beard and gave praise without holding back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing represented the Divine Sect, but that did not mean that the Old Sect Master &nbsp;favored him. The Old Sect Master was appreciative of Chu Mu’s methods instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, as Ye Qingzi had often mentioned Chu Mu to the Old Sect Master Xiao, he was already quite interested in Chu Mu. The only flaw was that Chu Mu was way too vicious......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gate Master Han was still able to suppress himself originally. However, after hearing the Old Sect Master’s praise towards the opponent, his gaze carried more personal emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, does that mean that the Old Sect Master Xiao thinks that the Fox Noble can obtain the victory in this battle?” asked the Elemental Clan’s Peng Meng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Old Sect Master smiled but did not answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching the Old Sect Master’s level, even if the outcome of the battle between the junior generation would affect the benefit of the faction that was behind them, the Old Sect Master would not really mind it. Instead, he would feel rather proud for having such a powerful individual in the young generation. It meant that the Zhengming Continent was full of talents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I love to watch Mo Xie’s battles the most. Its fighting methods always gave people a very calm and steady feeling. And once it grasps it's chance, the ferocious assault it dished out showed off its wild side as well. It doesn’t give the opponent any chance to make a comeback,” said Pang Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Its fighting style is the closest to Chu Mu’s personality,” commented Ye Qingzi lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu has so many soul pets, and Mo Xie is the boss amongst them, so how can it not be strong? Do you still remember the independence fight? Chu Mu’s other soul pets still had to take some time to win, but when Mo Xie fought against the Cloud Realm’s Realm Lord, the Cloud Realm’s Realm Lord’s soul pet was utterly tortured,” said Chao Lengchuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan was indeed correct. The three main properties, it's outstanding battle talent, in addition to the countless training that it underwent, had changed Mo Xie and it was no longer the feeble Moonlight Fox in that island. It had been carefully refined into a beautiful jade by Chu Mu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And a beautiful jade should let its dazzling beauty bloom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast’s ferociousness was in its unstoppable charge. Once the Heaven Horn Beast no longer had the courage to recklessly charge forward, its horns were basically nothing no matter how menacing they looked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blue sky, the nine long tails fluttered elegantly. However, Han Erxing’s horned beast could not grasp Mo Xie’s position accurately at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fox Noble's figure did not appear within the fluttering fox tails. Yet it seemed as if thousands of Fox Nobles were hidden inside there. The Heaven Horn Beast became dizzy from the incongruity and could only furiously unleash its power aimlessly into empty air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demonic Illusion. After performing the dazzling fiery bloom, Mo Xie’s elusive figure had made the short-fused Heaven Horn Beast mad!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more the Heaven Horn Beast became irritated, the more openings it exposed to others. Each time Mo Xie grasped the chance, its attack would elegantly shave away the Heaven Horn Beast’s life force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast was not like Zhan Ye. Furthermore, Mo Xie’s property also included flame, so its attack power was already very terrifying. After getting caught three times by it, the Heaven Horn Beast was heavily wounded. Its wounds were eroded and it's blood flowed profusely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast stood wobbly on a Hovering Mountain. It's blood flowed out from the wounds along its burnt armor and flesh, dripping onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its horns were still menacing, but the initial arrogance it showed could no longer be seen. Even those prideful eyes had completely lost their fighting spirit due to it's failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet’s failure was the same as the master’s failure. Han Erxing watched his soul pet in its current state, the arrogance and disdain that was on his face was no longer there!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did it become like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though my Heaven Horn Beast is one level higher than the opponent, why did the battle turn out like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he knew that the opponent was strong, then he was prepared to lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the opponent was a mere King of a tiny territory. He had actually lost to such an opponent under the public eyes. The confidence and anticipation he had to brutally humiliate Chu Mu had resulted in his own powerlessness after failing......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was probably the hardest fact for a proud person like him to accept!</span></p>
