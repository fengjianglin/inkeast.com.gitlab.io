 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the barren and cold land, the wind kicked up the sand and stones. The running creatures left deep trenches along the ground they trampled. They were rampaging like hungry wolves who had smelled fresh meat, desperately running towards the pot valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were at least ten soul pets coming from every direction. There were also some figures that were flying around the mountain summit ready to make a move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Noises echoed all around them. Chu Mu, Xia Yin and Lin Mengling faced three different directions. Dust clouds rumbled from those three directions. The earth kept trembling and cracking......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fight. If they were to break the cultivation formation, then our hope of entering Spirit Immortal rank will pop like a bubble,” Xia Yin’s eyes became spirited. It was completely different from his usual casual attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They could tell that he was a person who really liked fighting!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reciting an incantation, a dark green diagram manifested in front of Xia Yin. A vine appeared from that diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one main vine as the core, countless thinner vines rapidly spread out from it and weaved into a protection vine formation around the three of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Mu watched Xia Yin summon this soul pet, a little curiosity and confusion flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, this is Season Immortal Vine, a vine type creature with the best defense amongst its species,” Old Li explained to Chu Mu immediately, “This Season Immortal Vine is famous for its defense. There was once an army of several hundred Dominators and several thousand Emperors that had attacked Beiming City. Xia Yin’s Season Immortal Vine was able to keep the city completely unscathed. It was in that war that Xia Yin had gained fame and he became a legend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not know how Old Li collected his information, he even knew things that had happened not so long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Chu Mu had become acquainted with Xia Yin, he naturally wanted to know more about his new acquaintance. Beiming City’s defense war far surpassed New Moon Land’s independence fight in scale. Xia Yin had made a name for himself in that war. He was certainly a City Lord worthy of respect as he had defeated the invading army all by himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The population of creatures in this Imprint Valley is clearly overflowing. Creatures may constantly come swarming towards this place. The three of us should conduct a defensive battle with the area that my Season Immortal Vine covers as formation nodes,” said Xia Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling clearly knew about Xia Yin’s achievement as well, so she also believed in the defensive ability of Xia Yin’s Season Immortal Vine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following Xia Yin, Lin Mengling also chanted an incantation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet Lin Mengling had summoned was a Light’s Fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light’s Fury seemed to be the signature soul pet of the Divine Sect. Lin Mengling’s Light’s Fury should be at the pseudo Immortal rank, the milky white glow throughout its body exuded a holy aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not summon any soul pet and let Mo Xie handle the battle for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie had accompanied Chu Mu all this time and had slept for a long time. It was just in need of some exercising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A purple flame enveloped Mo Xie’s body and it danced in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine long and elegant tails spread out and they looked even more flashy than the Season Immortal Vine on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin and Lin Mengling looked at Mo Xie simultaneously. Xia Yin smiled, “Congratulations Brother Chu, your soul pet seems to have gotten stronger again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling also took a few more glances at it after sensing Mo Xie’s aura becoming more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling was actually at the venue when Chu Mu fought against Han Erxing. As far as she knew, this Fox Noble should have only been within the Dominator rank,but it was only one step away from pseudo Immortal rank now. If it could cultivate a bit longer within the cultivation formation, then it would definitely be able to advance into pseudo Immortal rank easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple flame burned along the slightly sloped earth, turning the area of the pot valley in that direction into a sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earth started rumbling, kicking up dust clouds. In that direction, there was an Evil Scorpion charging at the forefront. It led a few Dominator rank Evil Scorpions behind it and stepped into the purple flame fearlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evil Scorpion leader should be near Immortal rank according to its aura, and those other Evil Scorpions that were following behind it should be at peak Dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie was already able to fight against near Immortal rank in the past, and now that it has also reached near Immortal rank itself, it naturally would not fear them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwuwu~!” After a long cry, Mo Xie confidently charged towards that near Immortal rank Evil Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, Lin Mengling had also encountered a difficult opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cultivation formation gathered Immortal Aura and it could mainly help paragon Dominator and near Immortal rank creatures successfully advance into pseudo Immortal rank. Creatures that would desperately be swarming towards this place were naturally at such ranks. Three near Immortal rank creatures appeared in Lin Mengling’s direction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Lin Mengling’s Light’s Fury was at pseudo Immortal rank and it was a rank higher than those three creatures. Lin Mengling seemed to be very confident and did not summon any other soul pets. She decided to let her Light’s Fury take on those three near Immortal rank Evil Scorpions by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin’s Season Immortal Vine not only provided cover for Chu Mu and Lin Mengling, it also built a vine stronghold in the direction Xia Yin faced. That direction had the most number of enemies. There were about over twenty of them, with strength around near Immortal rank to middle class Dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Season Immortal Vine should be the strongest amongst the three soul pets. Those twenty plus creatures of different races would be paying a heavy price to charge through that vine stronghold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood spewed everywhere within the flames. Mo Xie was the first to end it's battle. Only the near Immortal rank Evil Scorpion was a little troublesome to defeat, the others did not pose a threat to Mo Xie. Soon, Mo Xie had finished off all nine Evil Scorpions and their corpses were burnt to ash by the purple flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the enemies in this direction were already cleared up, Chu Mu intended to help Lin Mengling next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Mengling did not need Chu Mu’s assistance, because her Light’s Fury was gradually using its own tactic to confront the encirclement from the three Evil Scorpions and began to gain an upper hand. Victory was only a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Xia Yin’s side, Chu Mu similarly did not need to help him as those twenty plus soul pets of different races never came out after they had entered Season Immortal Vine’s vine stronghold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Xia Yin had both ended their battles already. They noticed a few silhouettes loitering in the distance. However, those creatures did not have the courage to charge in, so the two of them had no reason to pursue those silhouettes needlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two then turned their attention to Lin Mengling’s battle after theirs were over. Originally, out of a simple gentleman courtesy, the battle should have been handled by the men. However, Lin Mengling was very different from most women, she was much more brutal in battles compared to most of the men. It was really difficult to tell that such a beautiful and cold woman like Lin Mengling would show a battle maniac style of fighting that was on par with male soul pet trainers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling had finally finished the battle on her side. Her Light’s Fury did not kill those soul pets and simply let them go after defeating them. This was different from the merciless methods used by Chu Mu and Xia Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of five near Immortal rank creatures involved in this assault. Lin Mengling took on three by herself, and the other two were finished off by Chu Mu and Xia Yin respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Near Immortal rank was already on the level of Han Erxing and Xin Xin. From how the three of them were able to easily finish the battle, it was sufficient to say that they had already surpassed the so-called Outstanding Expert Competition standard. They were certainly amongst the most powerful tier of the young generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, it was clear that the three of them did not use their full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lingmeng, letting them go like this is not a very good idea. They will definitely return after recovering from their injuries. They may even bring a larger group of their species along next time,” said Xia Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will not take the life of any creature unnecessarily. It’s your business if you want to kill,” Lin Mengling held firmly onto her own principle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin smiled bitterly, “Fine......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The creatures that are living in this Imprint Valley won’t be so few. More and more soul pets would sense the uniqueness of this place where we are currently cultivating. If such waves of soul pets keep barging in, then we can’t concentrate on cultivating,” Chu Mu frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the Martial Cloud Dragon around, the three of them were able to meditate peacefully for four months. However, after it left, those tempted creatures would definitely continue swarming towards here. Nobody knew how many wild soul pets between paragon Dominator and pseudo Immortal rank resided in this Imprint Valley. If they kept fighting them, then they would not have the time to cultivate peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way, how can there be so many of them?” refuted Lin Mengling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the following half a month, the facts had proven Chu Mu’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imprint Valley creatures continued swarming towards them ceaselessly, always attempting to snatch the Immortal Aura that could rapidly raise their strength from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them did not get any chance to cultivate at all and had to focus solely on defending against the intruders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more corpses spread out in the entire pot valley. The smell of blood had also similarly attracted some herds, tribes, empires or even dynasties over. There would only be more and more enemies coming if this trend continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This won’t do,” said Xia Yin with a stern expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enemies were endless. It was not that they were not strong enough to take on those creatures, but they would not be able to cultivate properly if they kept getting assaulted like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The time they had to cultivate here was very limited. They had already wasted half a month of it. If they continued wasting the time like this, then they might never be able to advance into Spirit Immortal rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s just summon all our soul pets and have them defend the surroundings of Season Immortal Vine. This should scare off all those ambitious soul pets. Even if that doesn’t work, at least those creatures won’t be able to break in if we do that. We can just continue our cultivation then,” suggested Lin Mengling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin shook his head in denial, “There’s a risk in doing that. Imprint Valley is an unknown land. If we were to exhaust most of our fighting strength on these things, then once we encounter a creature on the level of Martial Cloud Dragon, the three of us won’t even be able to escape from it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s guard in shifts then?” Chu Mu suggested, “Any of the three of us can single handedly take on the entire assaulting wave right now. I will stand guard for a period of time, while you two focus on meditating during this period. Once my soul pets are completely exhausted, one of you will take over the baton from me and allow me to meditate, as well as letting my soul pets rest too......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, doesn’t that mean that we will be sacrificing one third of our cultivation time?” asked Lin Mengling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can only do that now. It’s better than wasting the time of all three of us like this,” Xia Yin agreed with Chu Mu’s suggestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling lamented, they had never even considered such a situation like this occurring before coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu, let me guard first,” said Xia Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure,” Chu Mu did not refuse. Xia Yin had more soul pets, so it was more suitable for him to take the shift first.</span></p>
