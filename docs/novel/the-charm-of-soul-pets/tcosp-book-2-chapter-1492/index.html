 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that the Yellow Springs was young was a good thing for Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once a soul pet matured, it was very difficult to tame. Even if there was a soul pact, there would often be a conflict in views.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example the soul pact with Yu Suo. If it wasn’t because she was afraid of Chu Mu locking her up, Yu Suo wouldn’t listen to a word of Chu Mu’s, let alone his fighting commands; she may even command Chu Mu’s fights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because soul pets were mature before signing a soul pact and had complete ideologies they believed in. They would therefore have no tacit understanding in their cooperation with a soul pet trainer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the tone the mermaid princess used, the Yellow Springs was probably a very famous young evil tyrant of the Ocean Species that everyone feared. They wanted him to guide it upon a proper path. While Chu Mu himself had done numerous evil things, the task of reform and guidance would be best handed over to Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter the case, since there was a Yellow Springs here, Chu Mu had to have a look and try. If he could sign a soul pact, that would be the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess personally led Chu Mu and Ning Maner. As if she wanted to prevent the unexpected from happening, the mermaid princess brought a few Ocean Iguana Demon Guards. &nbsp;It was possible to see the fear she had towards Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After passing through the city’s ocean abyss, Chu Mu and Ning Maner followed the mermaid princess even deeper into the ocean. In the darkness, they were able to see the outlines and bumps of the ocean floor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the depths of the ocean, a fissure, the bottom of which could not be seen, suddenly appeared in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This terrifying trench was filled with turbid ocean water and ice-cold darkness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess and her guards brought Chu Mu into the trench. Suddenly, all of the light was swallowed and what surrounded them was darkness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess opened her mouth and spat out a pearl-shaped object. The small pearl let out a pale-white light that illuminated the malevolent appearance of the ocean trench.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they continued to descend, Chu Mu could no longer determine how deep the ocean was here. The pressure and obstruction of the water grew stronger and stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This place has a barrier. Under the barrier is the place where Yellow Springs is punished.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu glanced under him and discovered a dark blue water screen that didn’t even let water through blocking their path. This was an underwater barrier. It had probably been the Yellow Springs just now that smashed against this barrier, causing the Ocean species city to violently shake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess was particularly careful and cautious when she opened the barrier. She was genuinely afraid the fellow would flee. If that happened, not only would Eastern Ocean face the invasion of the Calamity Ocean Demons, but would also suffer the revenge of the out of control Yellow Springs. Eastern Ocean’s region would be in trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the barrier was slowly opened, the four Ocean Iguana Demons swam in front of the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the barrier, the mermaid princess immediately closed the barrier. How cautious she was could be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four Ocean Iguana Demons stood beside the mermaid princess. They looked like they were about to meet a great enemy. Their dark yellow eyes watched the surrounding pitch black ocean floor stones and other places where one could hide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ni!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a sharp thunderous cry rang out in the water!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound stunned the four Ocean Iguana Demons into a bout of dizziness. Their armor that was initially stuck close to their body instantly turned into blades that would defend against any attacking enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same moment, a long and powerful water figure swept by the front of the four Ocean Iguana Demons. Its tail suddenly grabbed one of the Ocean Iguana Demons!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this Ocean Iguana Demon could even let out a cry, its body was hauled into the air and fiercely thrown.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beng!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ocean Iguana Demon smashed into the rocky ocean floor, leaving a huge hole in the ground and causing the trench to violently shake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gu gu gu!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other three Ocean Iguana Demons witnessed their comrade getting beaten up and they were exceptionally angry. Their bodies instantly transformed into lightning that traveled through the deep water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three Ocean Iguana Demons were the Eastern Ocean Princess Guards that Chu Mu had seen previously. The sum of their strength was probably not too inferior to the devil transformation Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Ocean Iguana Demons quickly approached the figure. It was unknown what technique they used, but it formed a water prison of pillars that wanted to forcibly suppress the indistinct figure in a corner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their movements seemed slow. Chu Mu saw the water figure turn increasingly blurry. This was only a clone. The real attacking creature appeared behind the three Ocean Iguana Demons! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pai!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu saw a lightning-like tail fiercely slam into the three Ocean Iguana Demons. The three creatures were unable to defend in time and were knocked flying by the Yellow Springs into the hole where the other Ocean Iguana Demon was. In an instant, the four Ocean Iguana Demons were smashed into one piece.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ni ~~~ Ni~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The creature with the flood dragon tail didn’t pursue. It just floated to the side and watched the four miserable Ocean iguana Demons. Like a child, it waved its fins and looked very happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four Ocean Iguana Demons’ dark yellow eyes revealed anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them were immortal ranks, and it wasn’t excessive to call them Ocean Iguana Demon Emperors. In the ocean species, they belonged to the group of experts that could not be angered. However, they were being played with now by this small fellow. They were unable to just swallow this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess maintained a distance with the small Yellow Springs. She spat out a pleasant lullaby-like note.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ni~~~ Ni~~~~~” the small yellow Springs slowly swam over to the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its head was larger than the mermaid princess’s body. Its large pearl-like eyes looked somewhat innocently at the mermaid princess, before it curiously looked at Chu Mu and Ning Maner behind her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through the mermaid princess’s ocean light pearl, Chu Mu was roughly able to see the Yellow Spring’s head and its eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking truthfully, its eyes were very bright and very pure. The first feeling Chu Mu had was that this was still a child.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its head had a horn that was very smooth and took the shape of a trident. It was unknown whether it hadn’t grown into an adult body, or whether it just looked like this. Its forehead to its jaw were formed by azure scales that were glossy and soft. At such a close distance, Chu Mu wanted to stretch out his hands and rub the soft-looking scales.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The face resembled a Unicorn species creature. Chu Mu had seen the Unifying Wind Unicorn before and its appearance was roughly the same in terms of might, harshness, and dignity. However, because of this fellow’s large and sparkling eyes, it made its unicorn-like head rather cute and lovable. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bodies of Unicorn species were similar to beasts - their necks, torsos, four limbs, and tails.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered when he saw a Violent Unicorn Water Beast in Li City. Its body was similar to a shark. It had fins, but also had four limbs with claws. The fins were located in between the claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Violent Unicorn Water Beast was a hybrid blood lineage of the Unicorn species and Water Beasts. It wasn’t actually a Unicorn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The creature in front of Chu Mu had a similar body. However, it was about four to five times longer than the bodies of Water Unicorns and Water Beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its head to its neck, back, butt and tail formed a graceful water line.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had a perfect contrast between a Unicorn species head and a body in between a flood dragon’s slender body and a unicorn beast’s robust body. Finally, it had a slowly sliding down and shrinking flood dragon tail…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had seen many types of soul pets and hybrid blood lineages in books. However, he had never seen a creature of this form. It had the graceful elegance of a flood dragon and its slender body gave it great dodging abilities in fights as well as nimble methods of changing. It also had the strength, toughness, robustness, and might of most beast type creatures that came from its Unicorn Beast side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu looked at this creature, he felt that it was slowly being lengthened and changed from a Unicorn Beast’s body to a flood dragon’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The water type soul pet CHu Mu wanted wasn’t a finned creature that could only stay in the ocean. He wanted a water type soul pet that could stand on land and control water to submerge the land. Simultaneously, it had to have absolute fighting superiority in the water!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These requirements were particularly difficult because ocean soul pets and land soul pets were not as easily combined like elemental and beast soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also why Chu Mu had yet to choose a water type soul pet even after so long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, when Chu Mu saw the Yellow Spring’s unusual figure, he felt his heart beat!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a man having an idea of an ideal girl in his heart. When this ideal girl appeared in reality, it would be easy to fall in love at first sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had a similar feeling when he saw the Yellow Springs!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right. This was the water type soul pet he was looking for!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Chu Mu stepped on the soul pet trainer’s path, he mapped out a blueprint for himself. Simply speaking, it was a list of soul pets he wanted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s current soul pets he possessed list was essentially finished. Mo Xie, the White Nightmare, Ning, Devil Tree, Night, Zhan Ye, Ghost King, Qin, the Little Hidden Dragon, the Dead Dream… oh, Yu Suo had previously been dragged by Chu Mu to the blacklist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie was a perfect demon, beast, and elemental creature. She had speed, strength, and fire ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Nightmare was the other attribute. Its darkness and devil flames were strange and evil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning was the absolute pure ice type. It was a controller of snow and ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Tree had the steadiness and calmness of a plant world creature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night had absolute speed and dodging abilities. Added on its ability to hide in darkness and pass through dream realms…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye was the strongest incarnation of the beast and insect type. It was an unbreaking and tenacious hardcore soul pet personally created by Chu Mu. It was wild and persevering!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost King had two extremities. Absolute speed and defense!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin was a pure wind type. When its wind was soft, it would be a breeze that brushed past. When the wind was angry, a storm would engulf soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon was a unique soul pet with incomparable attributes. Even if it wasn’t on the list, Chu Mu still loved it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dead Dream had demonic and cold darkness, was superior and nimble in the sky and its techniques were strange and beautiful… it was also a wing type soul pet he fell in love with at first sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then what about water type soul pets?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was unable to fully sketch out his ideal water type soul pet. But when he saw the Yellow Springs, he immediately knew that it met his requirements!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, he had to capture the Yellow Springs!&nbsp;</span></p>
