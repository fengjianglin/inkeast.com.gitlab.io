 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vast maze had finally come to an end after going through risks after risks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lü Huo and Nü Huo were constantly tortured until exhaustion by the maze. Their soul pets were now even showing signs of fear after matching Night’s gaze which could manifest various nightmares.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you two doing?” In the sky, Feng Xu saw that the two of them have ended up in such a state despite only taking on one soul pet and roared out of frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain, this dream beast is really powerful......” answered Lü Huo with a green face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he could not find the second pattern of the maze. That meant that they had to carefully pass through those dark traps by exhausting a large amount of their stamina.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dream beast had exhausted a vast amount of mental strength to deploy the maze. However, the end result was that the two opponents had paid an even greater price. It would be difficult for the two of them to fight it in the following battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t the two of you handle it no matter how strong the opponent is?” shouted Feng Xu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu held plenty of advantage in his battle. His Burning Nine-Headed Bird was one whole level above the pseudo Immortal rank, it was certainly easier for it to handle that Fox Noble which had just reached pseudo Immortal rank recently. However, it was definitely not easy to defeat that agile Fox Noble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu took glances in Madam Huo’s direction occasionally and noticed that her brows remained furrowed. It was obvious to anyone that she was extremely dissatisfied with the six of them for taking such a long time and yet being unable to finish off the opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Huo’s expression had turned grim. On one hand, the Martial Cloud Dragon’s strength was clearly above her expectations. Her Shadow Flame Beast was unable to gain an advantage in a one on one fight. She had no choice but to summon her other soul pets to have them gang up on the Martial Cloud Dragon in order to reduce the overall pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that was all she could do at the moment. She did not dare to let herself get distracted right now and try to interfere with the battle going on at the other side. Otherwise, the Martial Cloud Dragon would easily destroy her soul pets if it grasped a fatal chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, she had a deep frown because of Hexfire’s poor performance. They were a really disappointing bunch as they were still unable to take down a single young soul pet trainer despite the fact that all six of them were working together!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Monument Tear was in his hands. Madam Huo could leave immediately after obtaining it, there was no need for her to stubbornly fight against such a powerful Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You six, hurry up!” shouted Madam Huo impatiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Madam Huo was shouting, the Martial Cloud Dragon also turned its head to check on Chu Mu’s battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it realized that this human also possessed impressive fighting strength and did not need its help despite facing six people, it was able to fully focus on the fire type soul pets before it which were stronger than the one's on Chu Mu’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most troublesome foe was obviously that Shadow Flame Beast. That fellow had taken a few of its full power techniques, yet there was no signs of it weakening at all. It was certainly a troublesome opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other fire type soul pets, they were fighting completely dependent on the Shadow Flame Beast as the pillar. Without the Shadow Flame Beast, it was easy to kill all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took a glance at the sky. The battle between Mo Xie and Burning Nine-Headed Bird was taking place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could tell that Mo Xie was indeed in a disadvantageous situation currently. On one hand, there was the difference of one level in rank. On the other hand, the wing type Burning Nine-Headed Bird clearly held an advantage in aerial battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu believed that it was only a temporary situation. Mo Xie was always able to remain calm and gain sharper observation ability while in a disadvantageous position. Once it grasped a chance, the opponent would never be able to salvage the situation anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu was clearly getting more and more impatient, probably because Madam Huo was exerting pressure on him. An opponent that had lost his calm would always show an opening. Mo Xie would soon be able to perform a beautiful comeback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not need to worry about Mo Xie’s battle. Night was also able to gain a huge advantage despite facing two opponents by itself. The side Chu Mu was worried about the most was Little Hidden Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon had just reached pseudo Immortal rank not long ago. Before Zhan Ye could boost its power, it had to face pincer attacks frequently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon had received quite a bit of injuries. Lan Huo and Li Huo were fairly experienced soul pet trainers. They possessed a certain level of judgement ability towards the ghost type’s irregular movement patterns. They could always somehow deal some damage to Little Hidden Dragon. If Chu Mu did not use his Other Pupil to keep directing the battle and continued estimating the opponent’s attack beforehand, then Little Hidden Dragon would have suffered from even greater injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye also knew the reason why Little Hidden Dragon had suffered those injuries. After going through Broken Limb Rebirth twice, Zhan Ye had also started frequently using defense ignoring type techniques such as Ink Armor Spike to attack the Flame Lion and did its best to stall the Flame Lion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flame Lion’s body was punctured by the Ink Armor Spikes. Its defense also fell greatly due to the spreading of the dark corrosion from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That had caused Lan Huo to be anxious. He just could not finish off that Zhan Ye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t you just kill it in one blow already? That thing clearly has insect property, its recovery speed is very fast,” grumbled Li Huo impatiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There had been many instances where they were about to kill that Spectral Dragon, but the fearless battle beast Mo Ye interrupted every time and they lost the chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know!” Lan Huo was also getting impatient. His temper was originally short-fused. Now that a Dominator rank creature was fooling around with him, he felt indescribably annoyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember it now. This battle beast Mo Ye seems to have the ability to regenerate its body many times. Its strength would also get boosted every time,” said Li Huo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hexfire had only watched Chu Mu fight Tang Zhuo and they never saw his battle before that. They had heard about it from the spectators who were discussing Chu Mu’s soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Say that earlier!” screamed Lan Huo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who could reach Immortal rank must have gone through countless battles. They must have seen rare techniques like Broken Limb Rebirth before. Facing such types of creatures, the best choice of battle was to kill it in one go. They must never choose to leave it alone after incapacitating it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Lan Huo had known about that, then this battle beast Mo Ye would have been dead long ago. He had been wondering why it could return to battle normally again and again despite suffering heavy damage each time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, after the second Broken Limb Rebirth, Zhan Ye’s life force and defensive ability had been strengthened manyfold. Lan Huo had lost the chance to kill Zhan Ye immediately, allowing Zhan Ye to boost its strength to paragon Dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye’s properties were rather unique. If it reaches paragon Dominator, then its life force would be six times higher than most other paragon Dominators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That meant that even if a full power attack from a pseudo Immortal rank creature might be able to kill a paragon Dominator, it would need to unleash six similarly powerful techniques if it wanted to kill Zhan Ye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such a great life force, the Flame Lion was unable to neglect Zhan Ye like it did before. Zhan Ye’s Ink Armor Spike had become even more powerful now. If Zhan Ye continued to attack it like that, not only would the Flame Lion keep suffering more wounds and have its defense reduced to nothing, but the Spectral Dragon might also grasp the chance to tear off a large chunk of its skin and flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That thing is getting stronger,” Lan Huo did not bother with that battle beast Mo Ye before. However, now when he was unable to kill it despite unleashing full power attacks at it consecutively, he finally realized that battle beast Mo Ye’s strength was rapidly increasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Huo did not care about Lan Huo. His attention was solely focused on that Spectral Hidden Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a one on one, Li Huo did not dare to get distracted. Although that Spectral Hidden Dragon was injured right now, Hidden Dragons possessed incredible recovery speed. He did not want the damage that they had dealt before to be wasted. Hence, he was fully focused on uncovering Little Hidden Dragon’s position.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwuwu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful fox cry was heard from the sky. Purple flames bloomed into countless beautiful death flowers, forcefully suppressing the Burning Nine-Headed Bird’s red flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Burning Nine-Headed Bird was suppressed by the sudden force, even Feng Xu’s face was filled with astonishment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a moment ago, his Burning Nine-Headed Bird had unleashed a powerful sure kill technique to finish off the battle for good. However, he never imagined that the opponent would be completely prepared for it and had dodged that fatal attack. Then, it immediately flanked to the blind spot of his Burning Nine-Headed Bird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu did not care about such careless actions at first. However, once that Fox Noble had suddenly unleashed such a savage aura, he began to panic and hurriedly made his Burning Nine-Headed Bird take on a defensive stance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie’s attacks were similar to an erupting volcano, constantly spitting out unstoppable fire pillars. Mo Xie’s speed, power and the purple flames had synchronized to the extreme and it unleashed unrelenting attacks almost without any gaps on the Burning Nine-Headed Bird!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Techniques after techniques, the Burning Nine-Headed Bird was able to put up a defence in time. However, it did not possess the accurate dodging ability of Mo Xie, so it inevitably suffered damage from the attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once it was wounded, that spot would become the breakthrough point for Mo Xie, forcefully widening the wound!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu was getting more and more panicked. He could clearly tell that if that Fox Noble continued such attacks for a few more turns, then his Burning Nine-Headed Bird would definitely end up gravely injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a choice left, he made his Burning Nine-Headed Bird use its final life saving technique to make an attempt to break free from this complete suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what completely shocked Feng Xu was that the Fox Noble had even anticipated the moment when he would choose to use his life saving technique. It had actually started chanting a long incantation immediately and had locked onto the direction that his Burning Nine-Headed Bird would escape to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu knew the power of a technique with a long incantation. After merely escaping a short distance, he immediately felt that the air in the surroundings was burning hot and streaks of purple flames had started twisting the space!</span></p>
