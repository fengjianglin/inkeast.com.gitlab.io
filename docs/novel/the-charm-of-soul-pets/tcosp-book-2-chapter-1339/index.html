They were discussing the xuan items that they happened to pick up while wandering Quiet Forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They saw Chu Mu bring Ning Maner out of the room, and wicked smiles appeared on their faces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, you truly have foresight. You managed to pick up a beauty capable of devastating countries. Moreover, you guys slept together for five or six days.” Ye Wansheng looked at Ning Maner, and spoke without restraint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After freshening up, Ning Maner’s natural beauty was completely displayed. Add on her unique temperament, and she was indeed eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner had seen Ye Wansheng a few times. But the last half of his words had made her feel embarrassed, and she could only hide next behind Chu Mu as she softly said: “Hello, Big Brother Ye.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng nodded his head, and introduced the adjacent Prince Chao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner politely greeted him, and Prince Chao said: “I heard my younger sister mention you before. You are indeed different from us common folk. Standing next to you, even I feel like I’m covered in dirt. Hahaha.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan’s younger sister was Princess Wanning. When Chu Mu had been in Soul City, Ning Maner and Princess Wanning had spent a lot of time together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them walked out of the residence, and found both Pang Yue and Xiao Xiao on the streets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ning Maner saw Xiao Xiao, she subconsciously wanted to go up and hug her. However, after looking closely, she found that this woman wasn’t the Big Sister Ye she was familiar with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner blinked her eyes with confusion at Chu Mu. She didn’t understand why Ye Qingzi wasn’t with Chu Mu, and instead, there was a woman who looked just like her within the group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a complete coincidence. Chu Mu had just told Ning Maner that Ye Qingzi was in Zhengming Continent’s main city, so she was naturally confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really want to see Big Sister Ye soon.” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll be heading to Zhengming Main City next. You’ll be able to see her then,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, ok.” Ning Maner happily nodded her head. She had wanted to leave Wupan Continent for some time now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Ning Family Dynasty believed she had lost her powers. They probably didn’t care where she went, so she could go wherever she wanted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, even if people from the Ning Family Dynasty wanted to stop her, she would still follow Chu Mu. After this painful experience, Ning Maner only trusted Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that’s right. When you fled Quiet Forest the first time, did you follow the Heaven Boundary Monument path?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This question had been bugging Chu Mu ever since he went there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu only knew that under Wanxiang City’s Heaven Boundary Monument was the dormant and extremely powerful Ancient Flood Dragon Person. This powerful creature would awaken during the next solar eclipse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for what secrets were contained in the other Heaven Boundary Monuments, Chu Mu didn’t know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Grandfather Tree wanted me to follow the Heaven Boundary Monuments. It told me that the Heaven Boundary Monuments would protect me.” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know what the Wupan Continent and Zhengming Continent Heaven Boundary Monuments are used for?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner shook her head and said: “I’ve only heard Grandfather Messiah Tree tell me that there are a total of 10 Heaven Boundary Monuments. They are scattered in different places throughout the world. Each Heaven Boundary Monument is like a Messiah Tree, and has its own protector. This protector is called a Monument Tear Individual. If I encounter a Monument Tear Individual, I can request the individual’s help and protection.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monument Tear Individual?” Chu Mu was even more confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother is a person with a Monument Tear. Although people with Monument Tears are not completely Monument Tear Individuals, I feel that Big Brother is capable of becoming one. Grandfather Tree said that Monument Tear Individuals will protect me, so that’s why I’ve been following Big Brother.” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it’s like this.” Chu Mu had believed that his encounter with Ning Maner was purely out of coincidence. He never expected for the status of a Monument Tear Individual had led to their encounter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of an ancient calling was the Monument Tear Individual?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All Chu Mu knew that what he had to do right now was raise his strength and strive to expel the Ancient Flood Dragon Person from New Moon Land before he awakened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandfather Tree said that Messiah Tree protectors were gradually declining while Monument Tear Individuals had always existed in this world, but had no idea where they were now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monument Tears both record the memories these people have engraved into their hearts and also hide some special memories in their hearts. When this person with the Monument Tear is able to remember the hidden memory, he will become a genuine Monument Tear Individual and step on the journey to solving the mystery of the Heaven Boundary Monuments. Grandfather Tree said that the Heaven Boundary Monument will make its selection from the experiences of those people that have the Monument Tears. It will then acknowledge that a person has a qualified Monument Tear Individual…” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had no knowledge of the Heaven Boundary Monuments. But according to Ning Maner, when the Heaven Boundary Monuments granted people Monument Tears, they would use the Monument Tears to silently watch the person’s experiences. Then, it would make its selection from among them for a person to become a qualified Monument Tear Individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The people chosen as Monument Tear Individuals are either extremely strong or have the heart to become an expert. Most of them have received the blessings of the Monument Tears. The moment they are chosen, they must use their powerful strength to pay back the Heaven Boundary Monument. This is different from Grandfather Tree because Grandfather Tree doesn’t ask for payment back.” continued Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already know the hidden memory you spoke of. It was an ancient beast soul, and it guided me to Demonic Burial Mound to find the method of dealing with the Ancient Flood Dragon Person dormant under the Heaven Boundary Monument.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The ancient beast soul you’re talking about is definitely the previous generation Monument Tear Individual. He planted this memory into the depths of some people’s hearts. Ultimately, he will choose one of these people to help him complete the task he was unable to. Big Brother’s strength is growing extremely fast. The ancient beast soul probably felt that big brother was worthy of fully becoming a Monument Tear Individual, so he has begun to guide big brother towards the Heaven Boundary Monument secrets.” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, but I have no clue about these secrets.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile rose on Ning Maner’s face as she said: “These are all mysteries and secrets from the ancient world that have lain uncovered for many years. If it were this easy to understand, there wouldn’t be this many Monument Tear Individuals inherited generation after generation. Grandfather Tree said that the world is like a continuous and undulating, yet complex and confusing mountain range. All creatures live between the mountains, and are extremely weak. All they can do is look up at the lofty cliffs and towering peaks. Only when these creatures are able to reach a certain height and see the mountains below them are they able to see the face of the world.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The ten Heaven Boundary Monuments are the same. While we are still weak, all they are to us are solitary and towering stone monuments that have been standing there for countless years; we don’t know the meaning of their existence. Only by slowly climbing up and standing from a higher viewpoint will we eventually be able to understand the genuine meaning of their existence.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner’s words resonated with Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, often there were special things that he could only understand by reaching a certain height.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps, the only way to uncover the meaning of the Heaven Boundary Monuments was to wait until he was strong enough to understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So this also means that the 10 Heaven Boundary Monuments represent the most mysterious things in this world?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner nodded her head: “Yes. The truth is there are many human and soul pet experts who have reached the pinnacle of strength, but are not Monument Tear Individuals, and are still walking around and around the Heaven Boundary Monuments.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu indeed never imagined these ancient stone monuments to be a peak mystery in the world. It really was as Ning Maner had said. Unless he stood at the peak of the mountain, the Heaven Boundary Monuments would just be stone monuments hiding secrets and mysteries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Also, big brother needs to be careful. There’s a rumor in the immortal rank that by gathering enough Monument Tears, one will be able to obtain the strength of an undying rank. Each Monument Tear Person and Monument Tear Individual only has a limited amount of things they have engraved into their hearts. Thus, the amount of Monument Tears is limited. In order to obtain more Monument Tears, people with wicked intentions will use extremely ruthless methods to steal Monument Tears from Monument Tear People or Individuals who have not completely matured in strength.” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aside from myself, I have never encountered another Monument Tear Individual.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You’ll meet them eventually. Big brother has been chosen as a Monument Tear person and in the future, if you encounter other Monument Tear Individuals chosen by the Heaven Boundary Monuments, your Monument Tear crystals will flicker with light. If that happens, big brother must be particularly careful, because you won’t be able to guarantee if these Fake Monument Tear Individuals have killed Monument Tear People or are Individuals that have obtained Monument Tears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. In a world dictated by strength, there would always be people with a desire to continue growing and seek even stronger power. Not everyone knew to examine their own souls to see if they had lost their humanity. Most living things had one head buried in the bloody pool of strength. This included Chu Mu. He didn’t exclude himself from among these people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monument Tear Individuals, Fake Monument Tear Individuals…how many Monument Tear Individuals and Fake Monument Tear Individuals are there in this world…” Chu Mu sighed after listening to Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that as he gained more strength, he would embroil himself into another battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had no clue how strong these Monument Tear Individuals and Fake Monument Tear Individuals were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother doesn’t need to be so sad. You have me.” Ning Maner saw Chu Mu sigh and hastily spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sad. Don’t you know that I innately like to fight?” Chu Mu raised his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu wu wu wu~~~” the small Mo Xie lying on his shoulder immediately let out a cry. and raised her small claws.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie was raising her claws in approval of his words. It didn’t matter what she had to fight, that was what she most enjoyed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother should be considered a maturing Monument Tear Individual. However, big brother will definitely get stronger very quickly, and perhaps become the person who solves the Heaven Boundary Monument mysteries.” Ning Maner said with certainty. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu saw how confident Ning Maner was in him and forced a smile as he pinched her cute and elegant nose: “How can it be that easy?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s possible.” as she spoke, Ning Maner got close to Chu Mu’s ear and whispered to him: “I suddenly understood something when big brother told me those words under the tree.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandfather Tree didn’t actually give the seed to me. Before big brother told me those words, I didn’t even know where the Messiah Tree Seed was… but the truth is that the seed has always been with me.” n enchanting smile rose on Ning Maner’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu initially didn’t understand the meaning of her words. But after carefully thinking, he immediately understood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young woman in front of him that had been brought up by the Messiah Tree was actually the seed itself that the Messiah Tree had diligently raised!&nbsp;</span></p>
