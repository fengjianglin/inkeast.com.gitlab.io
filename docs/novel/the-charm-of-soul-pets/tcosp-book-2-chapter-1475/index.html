 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The glacier was extremely cold. Snow had begun falling without them noticing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue sky had gradually disappeared, replaced by the chaotic gusts of wind and the falling snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of the bellowing wind was all that one could hear. Broken ice spikes were occasionally mixed in with the snow and slid past one’s body, deeply stabbing themselves into the ice rocks nearby!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After climbing over a snow mountain plain, the scenery displayed before everyone had caused the entire New Moon Navy to instantly draw in a sharp breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the uneven glacier, countless pairs of red eyes were sparkling eerily on the land that had become blurry due to the raging wind. Those were the eyes of the iceberg monsters. Those savage monsters who seemed to have sensed the humans invading into their territories. They furiously stared at a spot with their bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yine~! Yine~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sharp screeches from the iceberg monster birds could be clearly heard from the sky. They kept flapping their wings and the fallen feathers turned into snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This snowstorm was probably the handiwork of those monster birds. The New Moon Navy could not even detect them before those creatures had already begun hovering above them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had not expected those iceberg monsters to be waiting in anticipation of their arrival. He took a glance at his New Moon Navy and ordered them, “Prepare for battle!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone started chanting and quickly summoned their soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over a thousand Dominator rank creatures were occupying this snow mountain plain. Their composed aura blocked the falling snow and it generated a special defensive field around them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s that?” A Navy captain pointed at two glowing caves in the direction they were currently facing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two caves were located on the huge mountain range that New Moon Navy was heading towards right now, they were giving off a creepy feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, those two glowing caves moved slightly. In the hazy snowstorm, they could clearly see that the huge mountain range had suddenly shifted one step forward!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The humongous size of that thing occupied their entire view. It was walking directly towards them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was no mountain range, but a humongous ice beast. Those glowing caves were in reality its eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Martial Cloud Dragon’s body could be considered to be enormous compared to most creatures, but there was still quite a difference in front the mountain-sized Extreme Sky Ice Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My goodness, what is that monster?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy members were clearly astonished by the scene before them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had ventured into countless ocean realms in the Eternal Ocean before and had seen all kinds of marine creatures already. However, they had never seen a sea monster as big as this ice beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast belonged to the giant race. Its back was densely covered by a thick layer of ice shell armor. Its thick legs were just like mountain pillars. Its massive claws were hanging halfway down. Its plump body was equal in size to a connected mountain range. When it moved, it would push all the glaciers, ice mountains and ice rocks along its path and create a terrifying avalanche!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also countless other Dominator rank iceberg monsters around the feet of Extreme Sky Ice Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each of those iceberg monsters had reached over a hundred meters in size. However, compared to Extreme Sky Ice Beast, they appeared to be just rubbles that were scattered along with the mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast opened its enormous mouth at that moment, and it could be seen that the opening could even swallow half of the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its roar spread fiercely through the snowstorm and turned into a towering avalanche!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The New Moon Navy members had witnessed towering waves before, but they had never seen a towering avalanche. The latter was definitely many times more terrifying than the former.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial Cloud Dragon and I will be the ones taking on that Extreme Sky Ice Beast. All of you need to quickly kill those other Dominator rank iceberg monsters and monster birds!” Chu Mu stood in front of the entire army all by himself and instructed the New Moon Navy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hero Chief Yuan Sui nodded. A being on the level of Extreme Sky Ice Beast was not something that the Navy could handle. What they could do instead was to stop those Dominator iceberg monster army and the monster birds from interfering with the battle between King Chu and that super monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi, support them,” Chu Mu told Ye Qingzi who was next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy was one of the core powers of New Moon Land. This battle against Extreme Sky Ice Beast was not really advantageous towards them, and it could even be said that they are evenly matched. New Moon Navy would surely end up suffering from a great number of casualties in a prolonged battle. Chu Mu had to preserve the strength of this army as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Ye Qingzi around, she could reduce the number of casualties of New Moon Navy to the minimum. As long as they could remain alive, their fighting strength would also not diminish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry,” Ye Qingzi nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi wore a long snow white feather robe. After Chu Mu had issued the order, New Moon Navy took up a battle formation with Ye Qingzi as the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy’s armor was silver in color, which further emphasized Ye Qingzi’s alluring figure within the snow. When she chanted an incantation to get her Ice Fire Demon Concubine to add an ice armor buff on everyone, her calm and elegant figure fully portrayed the aura of a battle queen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every member who often participated in battles knew very well the true importance of a support soul pet trainer. They had to properly protect the support soul pet trainer well in order to last longer and perform better in the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ye Qingzi applied the ice armor buff on everyone, the overall defensive strength of those one thousand plus Dominator rank creatures had increased by at least thirty percent. That had allowed many Dominator rank creatures with weak defenses to be directly on par with those bloodshot iceberg monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s summon was not over yet though. After Bell Noise Concubine appeared, she began chanting once again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is healing petal, it will continuously keep scattering over you. If your soul pets get injured, then try to head towards places with more petals to take shelter. The petals will then automatically heal your soul pets,” Ye Qingzi used her mental voice to remind the New Moon Navy members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They raised their heads and noticed that it was no longer snowing in this plain. The snow flakes had changed into those healing petals before they knew it. It covered a really wide area. If their soul pets could be healed simply by just getting showered with enough petals according to what Ye Qingzi had said, then it meant that they could receive healing at any moment during the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two group techniques had clearly built up the confidence of the New Moon Navy members, their fighting spirit had also severely intensified!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, let me shower in blood today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Navy captain yelled and stared at those charging iceberg monsters with intense fervor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a rather famous battle maniac within the New Moon Navy. He had been wandering between various oceanic realms by himself since young and had made bloodthirstiness his habit. After joining New Moon Navy, he had finally obtained a better stage to perform and had rapidly grown within a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many members of the New Moon Navy had made a soul contract with Devil Soul. Their own racial rank no longer hindered their own cultivation. They could cultivate even faster than those higher rank races in the other borders. They were truly the elites of New Moon Land and they all possessed fearless hot-bloodedness within them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their king was fighting against a humongous beast, so how could they themselves achieve nothing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The captain took the lead and charged fearlessly towards an iceberg monster with steel-like ice armor while riding on top of his Water Shadow Fighting Devil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuan Sui watched the captain charge out and slightly frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of iceberg monsters was far larger than their own. In this situation, it would be best for them to maintain a tight formation and intercept the enemies that infiltrated within the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, on second thought, remaining so passive like that was not really a good thing either. There had to be some charging attacks with the momentum in order to influence the entire army. This bloodthirsty brat was the best candidate for that. Yuan Sui decided to just let him perform and influence the momentum of the entire New Moon Navy along with that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Queen, please help me keep an eye on him. He is a talented and strong-willed soul pet trainer after all,” Yuan Sui spoke to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi nodded. Simply charging out like that captain just did naturally held great risk. As the sole support soul pet trainer in the battlefield, such members had to be carefully taken note of, or they would easily end up getting torn to shreds by those iceberg monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was ignited in just an instant. The first spark was the clash between that steel ice armor monster and the captain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People with similar personalities would easily end up grouped into the same team. Even the timid people would have their hidden courage set ablaze if they were lead by such a fearless captain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other teams maintained their navy formation tightly, while the berserk team and all of its members were following right behind their captain and kept charging fearlessly towards the monsters raging around the formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a short moment, the blood had spectacularly dyed this entire white plain into red. This hundred-men berserk team was even more ferocious than those iceberg monsters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time that Ye Qingzi had met these New Moon Navy members. She knew that this army was recruited by Chu Mu himself in the recent years. It was difficult to imagine that an army that was formed in such a short time could possess such a great fighting strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The berserk team was extraordinarily ferocious. It was unknown whether they simply held absolute confidence towards their Queen’s healing ability or they were originally such a reckless team. They would often risk their lives in order to finish off a high class Dominator monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi did not disappoint the berserk team either. Iceberg monsters fell one after another before them, there were many Dominator rank monsters amongst the corpses too. However, not a single member or soul pet from the berserk team had died. They were all saved by Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many occasions where all of them believed that their soul pets would surely die. However, Ye Qingzi’s healing had pulled them back to life each time, it was just like resurrection!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy members were all strong-willed in the first place. After witnessing Ye Qingzi’s miraculous healing ability, their fighting spirit had swelled even higher!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they could be saved even after getting chopped into two to three sections, then just what was there for them to worry about? They could kill to their heart's content!</span></p>
