 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu only knew after going underwater that the coral island above water was just a tiny portion of the entire structure. This coral island became an enormous structure once he saw the portion underwater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were countless coral caves that could be crossed through. They were big and small, complicatedly connected with one another. It was like a maze after swimming into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The water around here had special dark currents. They could be carried somewhere without really swimming. Of course, these dark currents were gentle. They seemed to be traffic guidance and accelerated the speed of oceanic creatures, as well as helping the oceanic creatures determine their direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The underwater coral island was divided into many layers. After the mermaid led Chu Mu and Ning Maner to pass through various Ocean Species habitat, they reached the bottom part of this entire underwater city, or perhaps it could be said to be the city center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Various oceanic creatures swam past Chu Mu. They looked at Chu Mu and Ning Maner curiously and confusedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a human city, if there was a foreign race walking on the street, the humans would also do the same thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Chu Mu and Ning Maner played the role of that foreign race. In those ocean creatures’ eyes, Chu Mu and Ning Maner had proper upper bodies, but their lower bodies were not of fish tails, so it was strange......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid did not really like to talk. She only fulfilled her role of leading the way. Only when Ning Maner asked her questions would she answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they reached deep into the coral island, Chu Mu saw an underwater throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The throne was decorated by underwater corals and countless pearls. There were many sexy mermaids swimming around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than that, a few Ocean Iguana Demons were stationed around the ocean floor rocks. These Ocean Iguana Demons had a chilling gaze and terrifying aura. They seemed like statues guarding the throne, but if any unauthorized beings dared to approach half a step towards the throne, they would definitely kill the intruder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was astonished. Those Ocean Iguana Demons were already almost as strong as him. It was difficult to imagine multiple middle class Immortal rank creatures to appear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, those three Ocean Iguana Demons were clearly bodyguards. The target of their protection must possess an extremely important position in Ocean Species!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Chu Mu’s gaze looked past those alluring figures of mermaids and fell onto the underwater throne. He noticed a mature woman half leaning on the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her seaweed-colored hair fluttered along with the water current. Her mature and refined face exuded a tempting charm, her purple lips traced out her sexiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was more attractive was that this beautiful woman was similarly naked. Her abundant breasts were completely exposed in water. Chu Mu was able to get a full view of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mature lady saw the arrival of Chu Mu and Ning Maner. She smiled charminly, “Welcome, I’m glad a pure hearted person is visiting our Ocean Species.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This beautiful mermaid lady’s language was very fluent. It seemed that she did not use the effect of Arcane Sound and spoke the human language directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello...... Are you East Ocean Siren King?” asked Chu Mu using human language.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner kept pinching his arm at the side. Her bashful yet angry gaze was clearly telling Chu Mu to stop staring at that mermaid’s chest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could only lament. The other part was not wearing any clothes, he could not just look away when talking to her. If he looked at her while talking, he would naturally see the eye-catching spot in front of her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In another sense, he was using a soul pet aesthetic point of view to look at the mermaid. Just why would Ning Maner get jealous?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid lady shook her head, “He is my father. Using your human’s naming method, I am the Eternal Ocean Princess, as well as East Ocean Princess......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You seem rather familiar with humans?” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have human bloodline flowing within me,” said the mermaid lady with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was unsure if this bloodline meant she inherited the power of humans or she was a descendant of humans. He could not just ask such a rude question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We already know the intention of Elder Li. We are willing to help me. However, I believe you have seen the situation when you’re coming. Our East Ocean is currently in wartime. The Life Providence Grass you wanted is within Calamity Ocean Demon’s side to some extent......” said East Ocean mermaid princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she mentioned this matter, her smile also disappeared, turning into worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there any way?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can only wait until we recover those territories. Then, we can send subordinates to pick them for you,” said the mermaid princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How long will it take?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s hard to tell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night’s situation was not optimistic. It would completely turn into a corpse in another few months. Chu Mu did not have so much time to keep waiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, is there anything I can help with? I am New Moon Land’s King. The palace where the Son of Eternal Ocean, Ancient Flood Dragon Person, slumbers is in my territory,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we have a similar enemy,” Mermaid princess nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could tell East Ocean was also wary of Ancient Flood Dragon Person. Based on the current war situation, he was not opposing Ancient Flood Dragon Person alone. If he could ally with Eternal Ocean East Ocean, his possibility of defeating Ancient Flood Dragon Person would be much greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clang! Clang! Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were conversing, a wave of violent tremor suddenly came from deeper underground. The tremor caused the entire underwater city to shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lululu~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaids around mermaid princess were frightened by the tremor and escaped in all directions. They hid into underwater caves that looked like mini houses and did not dare to come out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, those three Ocean Iguana Demon Guards appeared around the mermaid princess and showed a stern expression. Their dark yellow pupils were staring hard at the deep abyss further underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if there was an enormous ocean monster stirring the water, dark currents became more rapid. A powerful underwater swirl appeared and the surrounding underwater rocks began trembling violently. It gave off a feeling that this coral city was about to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner grabbed Chu Mu’s arm in fear and cautiously looked at the bottomless abyss not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be afraid, it’s that fellow throwing its temper,” Mermaid princess was rather calm as she concoled Ning Maner as well as those mermaids who were scared away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the underwater city regained calmness after a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fellow?” asked Chu Mu out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A creature that could shake the entire underwater city must be extremely strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess smiled gently, “It destroyed the holy cultivation altar of Eternal Ocean Master, Eternal Ocean Master exiled it to our East Ocean’s abyss to make it reflect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s also a mermaid race?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, Chu Mu did not really know what abilities the mermaid race possessed. He also did not know those with partial human bloodline could sign a soul pact with humans to become soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tremor just now was really powerful. If that being was also from the mermaid race, it was really difficult to imagine how a mermaid that looked like a feeble human woman possessed such a terrifying strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess shook her head, “It’s not a mermaid. However, it’s the most prosperous race in our Eternal Ocean.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The most prosperous race??” Chu Mu was really lacking knowledge about the Eternal Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, the mermaid race has very little population. If I’m not wrong, these mermaids you have seen are probably the majority of their race. Mermaid race is similar to us raccoons in the Demon Species. We are the agents of Demon Species, they are the agents of Ocean Species. They are the symbol of intelligence, destiny and civilization. They lived under the accompany and protection of the most prosperous race. On the other hand, they act as the ambassadors to interact with other races. Perhaps due to the humans far surpassing other races in interaction, us agents usually possessed partial human features. Racoon, mermaid, beastman, flowerman and the likes,” Old Li immediately explained for Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s such a thing,” Chu Mu really never expected this Old Li to be the agent for the Demon Species. Apart from Old Li, the other five major races also had partial human feature creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused him to recall Yu Suo. Could it be Yu Suo was an agent of the flower race?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu immediately asked Old Li about this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Evil Good Queen is not an agent. She and young master are the same, both possess two souls. She was originally human, only turning into half human after integrating the Evil Good Ancestor’s soul. Us agents are different from you half humans. At least, we cannot transform between two forms. Furthermore, you half humans are originally human, so you can reproduce with humans. For example, young master can marry human women and reproduce descendants. You can also reproduce offspring with female half humans like Evil Good Queen. However, can young master do that kind of deed with these mermaids? No matter how mixed the bloodline is, the core difference between races lies in whether an offspring can be produced,” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, don’t be so lecherous,” Chu Mu was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is knowledge. It’s the continuation of life and the difference between lives. How is it related to lecherous?” rebutted Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine, back to the topic. What’s the most prosperous race of Eternal Ocean? This scarcely populated mermaid race is the agent of which race?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Old Li was in Soul Capture Ring, Chu Mu could still feel its disdainful gaze. It spoke, “Young master cannot even guess this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The representative of Hades is Demon Species supreme, the representative of Limbo was Flower Species supreme......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yellow Spring!” As Old Li spoke halfway, Chu Mu was suddenly enlightened!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t tell me the creature that made a ruckus just now is the famous Yellow Spring from the Five Great Undying Legends!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yellow Spring was the representation of water. Ocean Species highest ruler was an Undying rank Yellow Spring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mermaid princess, is that a Yellow Spring?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess was a little confused. However, after thinking carefully, she seemed to understand something and nodded, “Yes, it is called Yellow Spring according to your human naming!”</span></p>
