 <p><strong>Chapter 162: Abandoned City, Lair Calamity</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, suddenly going out like this is truly too dangerous. That brat is in the Great Broken Sting Valley. If he is going to die, he would have already died. If he isn’t going to die, then he definitely won’t die. Going a bit later shouldn’t affect it too much.” Old Li used soul remembrance to speak to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu naturally knew that this old fellow was afraid of death and greedy for life, so why would he listen to him? He immediately added a layer of soul remembrance protection on the soul capture ring, not giving him a chance to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, don’t. You’ve forgotten that you also earned the rewards from being in the top three. If you leave, the rewards from the two of you worth 10 million will be given to others just like that.” Old Li instantly yelled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Chu Mu were to add another layer of soul remembrance protection onto the soul capture spatial ring, it would be extremely hard for him to flee the soul capture space. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Li’s words made Chu Mu actually remember that the reward had to be obtained. No matter how he said it, it was the fruits of his and Ye Qingzi’s consecutive fights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since that’s the case, you stay here. When the Hibernating Desolation has finished, go find Old Tu, and bring back the reward. Afterwards, go to Great Broken Sting Valley to find me.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, this isn’t right. If something bad happens to you, how will I justify it to Her Majesty…” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu couldn’t be bothered to bicker with Old Li. He promptly gave the strange demonic soul pet to Chu Xian for her to look after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Mu, you should think it over. Don’t be impatient, it’s really dangerous outside.” Chu Xian ignored this strange old thing, and she pulled Chu Mu aside, worriedly speaking to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, nothing will happen.” Chu Mu caressed her cheek as a smile rose on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” Chu Xian wanted to say something more, but after seeing Chu Mu’s eyes, she didn't know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll leave. In the future, if you encounter any trouble, directly go and find Elder Tu. He’ll help you solve the problem.” said Chu Mu. After speaking, Chu Mu lightly hugged Chu Xian and walked towards the back of the stone hall’s great hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xian could only nod her head and watch Chu Mu leave with a disappointed expression, as if she had just lost something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, aside from being worried about Chu Mu’s safety, Chu Xian also cared about Chu Mu leaving this time. She could guess that he was going to a very distant place, and if Chu Mu left this time, she felt like she wouldn’t have a chance to see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Xian, you’re going to let him walk away like this?” Chu Xi suddenly ran behind Chu Xian and spoke to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xian was stunned then looked at her, saying: “He’s determined on leaving. There probably won’t be any dangers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who's talking about this? He was able to escape from a ninth phase monarch, so there definitely won’t be any danger. I’m saying that even if you can’t convince him to stay, you should probably follow him. Don’t think that I can’t see what you’re thinking in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xian shook her head: “It’s impossible for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>They followed the stone steps slowly towards the back of the stone hall. The entire stone hall was silent, so the only thing that could be heard was the sound of Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi’s feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see that she doesn’t want you to leave. You didn’t say anything and just left. Isn’t that not too good?” Ye Qingzi was a girl, and she naturally could see that Chu Mu and Chu Xian’s relation wasn’t as simple as a older sister and younger brother. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not good to say more.” a trace of bitterness rose on Chu Mu’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards his first love, Chu Mu felt that the indistinct kiss was already enough. After all, the reason why he liked Chu Xian back then was because she was kind and warm to him. Presently, many of Chu Mu’s thoughts had matured, and he knew that what he truly needed wasn’t an older sister whom he admired when he was young. If things were to develop further, he would end up holding her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about that princess? You don’t have to say anything to her? You aren’t her bodyguard?” curiously asked Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi could also see that Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou had a bit of friendship between them. This friendship was very strange, and Ye Qingzi’s inferences weren’t able to understand exactly what it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m currently already no longer her bodyguard. I didn’t like Nightmare Palace either.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi suddenly felt that Chu Mu seemed to be very straightforward when dealing with girl problems. However, this straightforwardness was a bit too resolute...</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they approached the small entrance in the crevice, Ye Qingzi instantly saw a shocking mark of disintegration that had expanded over the entire stone hall!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stone hall’s defense was extremely strong. Even that ninth phase monarch was unable to break through it; yet, this small entrance’s location was covered in innumerable cracks. How much strength did this exactly need?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is…” Ye Qingzi shockingly looked at Chu Mu. For a while, she didn’t know what words to describe it with. When Chu Mu returned to the stone hall, what kind of terrifying creature did he encounter?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a Ten Winged Heavenly Devil Insect. I nearly didn’t make it back.” Chu Mu saw that Ye Qingzi was continuously staring at him, and could only casually give a short explanation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Ten Winged Heavenly Devil Insect. Isn’t that…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, luckily when I saw it, it was still very far away from me.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could the scariness of a Ten Winged Heavenly Devil Insect be something that Ye Qingzi didn’t understand? By merely looking at the cracks on the entirety of the extremely sturdy stone hall, one could imagine it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go. Old Li said that as long as we are careful, we shouldn’t encounter any creatures of that level.” said Chu Mu as he walked in front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exit was originally very narrow. Yet, because the Ten Winged Heavenly Devil Insect's strength had torn much of it apart, Chu Mu had to push back a few piled on rocks before seeing a slight bit of faint light beams exit the stone hall from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu sent his soul remembrance out to search the surroundings and to see if there were any groups of Heavenly Devil Insects nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s soul remembrance already covered over a hundred meter area, and as long as soul pets were not intentionally hiding, they would all be detected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are only a few weak Heavenly Devil Insects. I’ll deal with them first.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a blood vial. Once you kill a Heavenly Devil Insect, pour your soul remembrance into the blood vial, and the blood vial will extract the blood from the Heavenly Devil Insect’s body on its own.” Ye Qingzi passed a blood colored vial engraved with various strange flower patterns to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Chu Mu had seen this kind of item before, and he carefully looked it over before putting it away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chanting an incantation, Chu Mu began to summon the Night Thunder Dream Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Night, Death Ray!” Chu Mu jumped onto the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s back and immediately let out an order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark light flickered on the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s horns. A death ray gathered in its mouth, and it was abruptly spat towards the nearest Heavenly Devil Insect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hong!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Death Ray erupted on that fifth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect, and it was instantly exploded into pieces- flesh and blood flew everywhere!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll directly jump down and move around from the city to the north face of the mountain.” Chu Mu poured soul remembrance into the blood vial before speaking to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, directly passing through Chu Mountain isn’t too feasible.” nodded Ye Qingzi. She didn’t have any wing type soul pets, but even if she did have one, they didn’t dare to directly fly through Chu Mountain, because it would be even easier to suffer the attacks from Heavenly Devil Insects in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi had already summoned her Purple Robe Dream Beast and jumped onto it. She then urged it to immediately jump off the seemingly vertical precipice high up on the mountain! </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Mu had gotten rid of the surrounding few weak Heavenly Devil Insects, he promptly followed Ye Qingzi, and rode on the Night Thunder Dream Beast as he jumped off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Night Thunder Dream Beast could only temporarily tread on air during the daytime, but this steep mountain with rugged rocks on it wasn’t considered too hard for the Night Thunder Dream Beast. As long as he buffered the descending speed with the adjacent rock rampart, he would be like a black colored fairy, elegantly jumping off the mountain peak to the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not far away from the main Chu Mountain peak was Wogu City. Looking down from above, the entire Wogu City was covered by a black colored insect cloud. The originally ancient and solemn great city seemed a bit lifeless and a bit desolate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them quickly landed on the ground. A few Heavenly Devil Insects that chased them from the air were immediately disposed of by Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi’s dream beasts. They were changed into insect blood that poured into Chu Mu’s blood vial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is only two blood liters…” bitterly laughed Chu Mu as he shook the blood vial where the compressed blood didn’t even cover the bottom bit. He shook his head with a forced smile; the blood from a thousand Heavenly Devil Insects. He truly didn’t know when he would be able to collect it all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it slowly eh. They’re everywhere…” consoled Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they continued down this desolate hillside, Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi eventually entered the city. However, when they surveyed the nearby city entrance, the two of their expressions slightly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They remembered that when they had entered the city, there were many people inside and outside the main entrance of the city. Numerous soul pet trainers were riding on their steeds, galloping through the wide avenues. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, right now, what manifested in front of them was something incomparably bleak. Even the phrase dismal and miserable could be used to describe the city’s entrance.</span></p>
