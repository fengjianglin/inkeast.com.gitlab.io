 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A plaintiff cry rang out from ahead. Once they passed this highland, what greeted their eyes was a basin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large group of Devil Wolves lived in the basin. These Devil Wolves were running as fast as they could and letting out panicked cries. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their dark blue bodies weren’t running in a particular direction. Instead, they were just madly running in different directions. From Chu Mu’s angle, he could see a larger Noble Devil Wolf. It was holding a recently born small Devil Wolf in its mouth. Behind it was a group of mature but smaller in stature Devil Wolves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of these Devil Wolves were following the Noble Devil Wolf and running. However, the ground in front of them suddenly fissured and a terrifying abyss appeared right there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was impossible to jump over the spatial fissure because this was a bottomless spatial abyss. Jumping across would just be jumping into the abyss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Noble Devil Wolf abruptly came to a stop. The large group of Devil Wolves behind it also stopped and looked behind them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind them was a continuously expanding black hole that was rapidly devouring everything as it kept approaching the group of Devil Wolves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ao wu~~~~ Ao wu~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Wolves had no place to flee. They raised their heads and let out mournful cries at the dark sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hong hong hong~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the location they were standing collapsed. An enormous black hole, resembling the digestive tract of a monster, abruptly appeared. With one large bite, it swallowed the several hundred Devil Wolves into its stomach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Wolf group had at least reached the dominator rank in strength. However, no matter how much they stepped on air or struggled, they would ultimately fall into the bottomless abyss… this was a horrifying scene that occurred right in front of Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Servant rank, commander rank, emperor rank, and immortal rank… the strength which every creature pursued was simply insignificant in a collapsing world. It was so insignificant that there was no room to even struggle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were countless powerful creatures that inhabited Imprint Valley, but the situation that had just occurred had happened to countless powerful creatures. These creatures had spent tens, hundreds or even thousands of years cultivating. Perhaps they were lacking a tiny step to reach the immortal rank, or maybe they had just stepped into the immortal rank. However, they were still met with ruin!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu blankly watched the spatial abyss. It was a long time before he returned to his senses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu wu~ Wu wu wu wu~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly a weak voice rang out. In the pitch-black abyss, the small wolf that was just recently born, was thrown into the air. It was protected by a dark blue colored light and it was flying towards Chu Mu’s group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the infant wolf held in the Noble Devil Wolf’s mouth. This small wolf probably wasn’t even a month old. It hadn’t even reached the first phase first stage. And if it wasn’t protected by the dark blue colored light, it would have already been ripped apart by the merciless spatial airflow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou was the first to react. She flew past the six Darkness Sect members and flew into the terrifying abyss. She then used her remembrance to grab the infant wolf that had been thrown up from the abyss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu saw Princess Jinrou do something so dangerous, he hastily went to save her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when Darkness Sect’s members saw Chu Mu’s actions, they glared at Chu Mu as if they were going to kill Chu Mu on the spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Princes Jinrou grabbed the infant wolf, her body fell into the spatial vortex’s range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under normal circumstances, when a creature fell into a spatial vortex, they would inevitably be pulled into the black hole. Even pseudo immortal rank creatures couldn’t break free, while low class immortal ranks could barely break out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou’s strength came from the Devil Soul and her strength was very hard to accurately determine. Her spectral attribute caused the spatial suction force to be slightly weakened against her. After securing the small wolf, she slowly flew back to her original location.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she flew, she was finally able to break free of the spatial vortex and floated back to Chu Mu’s side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took the small wolf from Princess Jinrou. He knew that Princess Jinrou needed to use remembrance to hold physical objects. Although the small wolf was very light, holding it like this would expend much mental energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young sister, are you not afraid of death?” Young Lady Si glanced at Princess Jinrou and spoke with a smile that wasn’t a smile either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am afraid.” Princess Jinrou responded, but her eyes were on the small wolf Chu Mu was holding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small wolf hadn’t even grown its teeth yet. It looked like a dark, blue-colored small dog. It mischievously flipped around in Chu Mu’s arms and widened its small mouth into something that resembled a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This small fellow ostensibly didn’t understand that its father and family members had just disappeared from the world a second ago. It naively blinked its eyes and curiously looked at Chu Mu and Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stroked the small fellow’s head. He retrieved a snack for Mo Xie from his spatial ring and gave the snack to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Noble Devil Wolf had definitely seen them; therefore, as it was about to be devoured by the black hole, it threw its child towards them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Noble Devil Wolf didn’t know that Chu Mu had actually killed many greedy Devil Wolves in Imprint Valley. However, as long as there was a bit of hope for survival, it was willing to do whatever it took.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was possible to guess that the moment the Noble Devil Wolf fell into the black hole of death, its heart wasn’t filled with a fear of death, but rather a hope that those humans would be able to accept the small wolf and take care of it…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a high bloodline Sky Wolf. Do you wish to raise it?” Young Lady Si smiled as she spoke to Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou didn’t respond. In fact, whether it was a Heaven Wolf or the lowest ranking Hunting Wolf, after seeing the scene just now, she wouldn’t be able to remain indifferent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter turned around and glanced at the small wolf rolling around in Chu Mu’s arms. His eyes both didn’t seem to change at all, but also seemed to have a small ripple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s continue.” Heaven Slaughter indifferently said. He didn’t say anything towards Princess Jinrou’s actions just now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter walked at the very front. A very, very deep fissure appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fissure was about 2000 meters wide. Such a width was fatal to even immortal rank creatures. If one dropped into it, there was no chance of surviving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness Sect’s members obviously saw the fissure, but with Heaven Slaughter walking at the front, what lay in front of them was no longer a terrifying spatial fissure, but merely a ditch that they could easily step over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fissure was already within view, but Heaven Slaughter still continued forward. Then, something strange happened. When the Crown Horned Devil he was riding on strode into the fissure, the originally shattered fissure slowly began to mend itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial mending happened to occur right under Heaven Slaughter’s Crown Horned Devil. It was like an icy path slowly condensing deep in an ocean that extended towards the other shore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter’s subordinates didn’t realize their master had such a remarkable ability. They all watched with shock as Heaven Slaughter leisurely sauntered over the terrifying fissure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Every place I step on will recollapse after ten seconds.” Heaven Slaughter didn’t acknowledge their shock. Instead, he indifferently dropped this sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Lady Si had always remained by Heaven Slaughter’s side and was progressing with him. As for the other six Darkness Sect members, when they heard Heaven Slaughter’s words, they hastily escorted Chu Mu, Princess Jinrou, and the Martial Cloud Dragon to follow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the mended path would disintegrate after ten seconds. It was like an icy path melting. If they were even a bit slow, there was a chance they could fall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, everyone was feeling like they were walking on a single log bridge over a bottomless abyss. However, the single log bridge didn’t exist in front or behind. It was extremely frightening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What kind of strength is this? How can it mend space?” Princess Jinrou quietly said to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure either.” Chu Mu himself was an other type. However, he had never realized that shattered space could be mended using strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was meticulously observing Heaven Slaughter’s feet. He indistinctly saw some outline. This outline was walking a bit ahead of the Crown Horned Devil. It looked as if space would mend itself wherever the Crown Horned Devil took a step. However, in reality, it was probably that outline using spatial mending as it moved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Li, what creature is that?” when Chu Mu finally discovered it, he asked Old Li what it was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, that is probably a Strange Mane Demon. It’s an extremely rare wing type creature. Although its species rank is only at the monarch rank, even now nobody understands what kind of abilities it possesses.” Old Li’s eyes were indeed discerning and merely from the outline he was able to determine what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Strange Mane Demon…” Chu Mu muttered to himself. He felt like he had heard of this creature somewhere before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to make their travel more convenient, the Martial Cloud Dragon’s body had shrunk to about the size of a human.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small Martial Cloud Dragon baby was still lying on its head and playing with the small Sky Wolf.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon baby’s favorite playmate was Mo Xie. However, while Mo Xie looked small and delicate, her intelligence wasn’t that of a child’s. Thus, the small Sky Wolf happened to fit the Martial Cloud Dragon’s baby’s liking. These two fellows didn’t seem to know that the world had collapsed, and were continuing to happily play around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon’s motherly instincts seemed to flow over as she was particularly considerate of the small wolf. When the two fellows grew exhausted from playing, she would take the small SKy Wolf and take care of it as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they continued forwards, the Imprint Valley now was no longer the Imprint Valley Chu Mu had seen in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Creatures were running in confusion, birds were panic flying in disorder, the heaven and earth had been destroyed and all creatures were in ruin. On their path, CHu Mu saw too many heart-trembling scenes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw several tens of thousands of Light Sparrows be instantly devoured by a black hole - their feathers had poignantly drifted aimlessly. He saw two Blood Beasts lonely and helplessly standing at the peak of a mountain, surrounded by an ocean of death; no matter where they went, they could only wait for death. He saw a group of Tailed Demons that originally wanted to help save their species members ultimately themselves fall into an abyss… he even saw from afar the entire Light Valley formation disappeared from the earth. During that instant, the scene of the two milky white colored Seven Sins Foxes nestled against each other appeared in his mind… they were the highest bloodline creature in this world, but were unable to flee their destiny of being buried along with the world?&nbsp;</span></p>
