 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three months later, Chu Mu had already stepped into Wupan territory unknowingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhengming territory bordered Wupan territory. New Moon Land happened to be right in the crevice between Zhengming and Wupan overlooking Eternal Ocean. As for New Moon Land’s so-called forbidden regions, they were actually two vast territories of isolated areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Land’s uniqueness lay in the fact it was situated between these two isolated areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The forbidden regions were extremely vast, especially the northern side’s hibernating desolation area and the Southern Forbidden Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The areas of Southern Forbidden Region Chu Mu had been to were only the tip of the iceberg. This small corner he had been to was near New Moon Land, but behind it were the enormous icy mountains that meandered like a long dragon towards the northeastern stars. They spanned a huge amount of land, splitting it apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, how long do you think it will take us if we fly along Southern Forbidden Region’s mountains until the end?” Ye Wansheng asked as he looked at the map.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With the speed of my Night Thunder Dream Beast, probably a few years.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world was unimaginably large. At the beginning, it had taken Chu Mu countless years for him to go from Western Kingdom to Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had thought New Moon Land was incredibly vast then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, Night would be able to make that trip in a single day. Thus in Chu Mu’s eyes, New Moon Land had become very small.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, this didn’t mean the world was very small, especially given how boundless the mountains of Southern Forbidden Region were...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wondered what was at the end of this world’s horizon? What would he see there?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu obviously wouldn’t enter Wupan Territory from Southern Forbidden Region. Ye Wansheng, Chao Lengchuan and Pang Yue left first, while Chu Mu rode on Night over Dark Ocean to catch up to the three of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without surprise, Chu Mu had brought an extremely troublesome fellow: Third White who could go berserk at any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Third White learned Chu Mu would go to Wupan territory to find Ning Maner, he nearly turned into a Black Nightmare out of excitement. Thinking of its evil and cold black flames, Chu Mu couldn’t help but shake his head. If it really did transform into a Black Nightmare, he wasn’t sure he would be able to subdue it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like the past, Third White obediently followed behind Chu Mu, acting as his soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not permitted for wild soul pets to enter cities, especially those like Third White that had reached the peak dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Third White had indeed obtained huge benefits when it entered Evil Temple. Most obviously, it entered the peak dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A peak dominator rank bodyguard following him wasn’t something bad. Besides the fact he lacked a mental connection with it, Third White wasn’t too different from Chu Mu’s soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for some reason, when he remembered that it could go berserk at any moment, Chu Mu wasn’t able to sleep well on the first few nights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before leaving, Liu Binglan had given a large amount of the navy bounty money to Chu Mu. It was around 50 thousand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More prosperous cities in Wupan territory would have the xuan items Chu Mu, Ye Wansheng and Chao Lengchuan needed. If they didn’t have any money to purchase them, it would be embarrassing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the nine great Holy Regions were the goldmines of New Moon Land. Chu Mu just had to invest resources into New Moon Land when it was suitable for him. There was no need to invest too much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first city the group of them entered was a ninth rank realm city. In order to draw less attention, Chu Mu did as before and used a cloak or something similar to cover Third White’s conspicuous devil flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Third White had often followed Chu Mu through cities and wasn’t as sneaky as before. Instead, it acted like a human and brazenly walked among the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of which, when he remembered First White and the other nine of them dressing in disguise and following Ning Maner through the city and wreaking havoc, Chu Mu felt it was slightly comical.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four humans and one Nightmare didn’t stay long in this ninth rank city. But they purchased a fifth rank xuan item for Pang Yue’s water type Water Phantom Fairy to be strengthened to the middle class dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, do you know where that young pretty lady is?” asked Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know the approximate direction.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having a mental connection with Ning Maner, Chu Mu could approximate which direction she was in. Following this probably wouldn't’ be wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the path to take, Chu Mu already had Pang Yue take care of it. They would try to avoid cities since they had come to train as well. If they kept going from city to city, it would just be a walk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to raise their strength, the path Pang Yue chose would pass through a few of Wupan territory’s bewildering worlds.This would give the four of them ample training.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Old Li, this treasure finding expert, entering a bewildering world would be a chance to plunder and root out resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were numerous bewildering worlds in Wupan territory and many of the high rank bewildering worlds were not visited by humans. The less people that had been somewhere, teh more treasures there were. The four of them weren’t particularly pressed for time, so if they were going to walk through them, they obviously couldn’t afford to pass over them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu focused mainly on training Ning and Qin. This would prepare them for entering the high class dominator rank. He focused secondarily on training the Little Hidden Dragon and Zhan Ye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon was now at 90% and with another 10%, it would have a peak dominator rank’s strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Zhan Ye, Chu Mu would frequently have it fight high class dominators with its middle class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu discovered that with the Ancient Power Awakening, Zhan Ye was like a fish in water. If it had enough time, it wouldn’t have a problem challenging creatures near the peak dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye’s surpassing-rank fights allowed its training percentage to increase extremely quickly. Practically each time it defeated a high class dominator rank creature, it was able to increase by 5%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it could defeat a peak dominator rank creature, perhaps it would instantly increase by 10%. Perhaps it didn’t even need a xuan item to increase a rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also the Combining Amber problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Combining Ambers were sold in a few border cities, but these treasures were often priceless. The moment one appeared, it would be instantly purchased. Then, one would have to wait another long while before another appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they had walked through a few cities with more of a business atmosphere, Chu Mu had always been one or two steps late, failing to purchase a Combining Amber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the group was heading for a city called Luan City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They heard that many xuan teachers were gathered in this city and Combining Ambers frequently appeared here. Moreover, if they needed other xuan items, they could find xuan teachers in this city to refine it for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he obtained a seventh rank Combining Amber, with the Heaven Monument Beast Soul Core and the xith rank dark xuan crystal, Chu Mu would be able to have a seventh rank beast and insect dual main attribute and dark sub attribute xuan item. Zhan Ye’s high class dominator rank would be just around the corner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of four of them and most of them had soul pets with 70% or above training percentage. They planned on stocking up on funds on their path because Luan City would probably be extremely expensive; indeed, they had so many soul pets that needed strengthening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was early morning when fresh sunlight streamed through the leaves, falling onto the grassy ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clear sound of birds resonated through the air, waking Chu Mu who was sleeping in his tent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu walked out of his tent and used dew water to wash his face. He happened to see Pang Yue sitting under a tree, silently cultivating. It seemed like she had spent the whole night cultivating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rare for Pang Yue to be so diligently cultivating. Chu Mu didn’t bother her and opened up the complex map.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each time they arrived at a city, Chu Mu would purchase a map. The number of maps he had were about to fill up his small spatial ring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we keep going forward, we’ll probably arrive at Thousand Layer Forest, which is known as a cornucopia. Once we pass through Thousand Layer Forest, we’ll probably reach Luan City.” said Chu Mu as he looked at the map.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did some rough planning. The Combining Amber Zhan Ye needed was probably around 10 thousand xuan while Qin and Ning needed over 20 thousand xuan for their xuan items. If he took a conservative estimate, he probably needed around 40 thousand xuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, Prince Chao’s Thousand Wave Beast was on track to break into the peak dominator rank so that would be another huge sum.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng apparently had many great things on him that he took out from Cloud Gate’s old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recently, Ye Wansheng had been abnormally diligent because he already had the ninth rank xuan item for his Empress Heavenly Thunder Snake. It was almost about to enter the peak dominator rank, so why wouldn’t he be excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Pang Yue had spent the last while training with them who were higher ranked, she was pretty much only fighting those higher ranked than her. Thus, her soul pets’ training percentages had shot up. By the time she arrived in Luan City to purchase her xuan items, her soul pets’ power would probably be completely changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pang Yue wouldn’t have to spend much. Indeed, even if she needed high class dominator rank items, ten thousand xuan wasn’t a huge sum in Chu Mu’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prince Chao needs 60 thousand xuan and I need 40 thousand xuan. Adding on Pang Yue and Ye Wansheng, we probably need 150 thousand xuan.” Chu Mu continued to estimate. They would have to at least collect enough funds before they entered Luan City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu had embarked on this trip, he had brought 50 thousand xuan with him. On this trip, totalling the amount he gained and spent, he ended up with around 30 thousand more xuan. All together this was 80 thousand xuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he still lacked 70 thousand xuan. This 70 thousand xuan had to be obtained in Thousand Layer Forest, which was nicknamed “Cornucopia”. Chu Mu believed that Old Li wouldn’t let him down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they managed to obtain one or two ninth rank xuan items, it would be no problem for them to purchase the things they needed to buy. Indeed, a single ninth rank xuan was worth around 60 thousand xuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most important thing was whether Old Li would be able to smell out a ninth rank xuan item. If he was able to, CHu Mu felt that his current strength would easily allow him to take the item. Indeed, he currently had three peak dominator ranks with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
