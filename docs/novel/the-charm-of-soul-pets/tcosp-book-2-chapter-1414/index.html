 <p>“Haha, we really are lucky, we met a Martial Cloud Dragon infant. No one contest this, this little Martial Cloud Dragon is mine!” A brash sound came from the woman’s voice.</p>
 <p>The woman had ink colored hair with hair coiled like a snake. Her slightly yellowed face also had two snake tattoos.</p>
 <p>She had a strange laugh, coupled with a stranger outfit.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I naturally won’t fight over it with Sister She. Sister She will get the most of it, and we can just get a little less. This Martial Cloud Dragon’s soul core, for example…..” The other two men said.</p>
 <p>These two men both had a snake tattoo on their head as well, but its colors were different from the female named She.</p>
 <p>These two snake tattoo men both rode immortal rank soul pets. Behind them were four or five subordinates all strong as well that were fighting the Martial Cloud Dragon with Sister She.</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon was annoyed and angry, with its dragon breath constantly shooting towards them!</p>
 <p>“Houhou!!!!!” Martial Cloud Dragon knew what they were thinking about and showed no mercy. The dragon breath landed on one of the four-winged dragons nake’s bodies, causing its skin to melt!</p>
 <p>“My Snake Dragon!!” A soul pet trainer shouted!</p>
 <p>Dragon breath was spewed onto the four-winged Snake Dragon. With a large shout, the Snake Dragon became a pile of bones in a few short seconds!</p>
 <p>These snake tattoo people all drew a breath. They had no idea that this Martial Cloud Dragon would be this powerful, able to instantly kill a pseudo immortal rank four-winged Snake Dragon in one breath!</p>
 <p>“Trash, keep formation!” The Sister She angrily yelled!</p>
 <p>Their Snake Dragon faction had spent a long time to create an immortal rank member, yet it was killed without any effect against the Martial Cloud Dragon!</p>
 <p>The other members of Snake Dragon Faction saw someone’s soul pet die painfully and no longer dared to go easy, quickly maintaining formation, lest they end up dying in the same way.</p>
 <p>When the Snake Dragons ganged up, their long bodies created a coiling formation around the Martial Cloud Dragon. The snakes’ poison on the Martial Cloud Dragon blue skin slowly corroded the armor layers.</p>
 <p>The Martial Cloud Dragon flapped its wings and slammed its powerful body straight into the formation!</p>
 <p>It wasn't successful, and was quickly slapped back by the Snake Dragon tails surrounding it. It quickly was met with a wave of biting and scratching!</p>
 <p>The Snake Dragons’ poison fangs couldn’t bite through Martial Cloud Dragon’s defense completely, but their poison was incredible.</p>
 <p>As the poison stayed in its body for longer, any powerful organism would slowly be weakened. The Snake Dragon Faction planned to use this formation to trap the Martial Cloud Dragon and slowly weaken it.</p>
 <p>The more strength the Martial Cloud Dragon showed, the more they all wanted the Martial Cloud Dragon infant. After all, their entire faction valued powerful dragons and snakes.</p>
 <p>“Maintain formation, if anyone makes a mistake, I’ll throw them into my Wa Snake’s belly immediately!” That Lady She’s sharp voice reminded everyone.</p>
 <p>The others no longer dared to get distracted. Both the Martial Cloud Dragon and Enforcer She were characters that would kill without a second thought.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Not far away, when Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou arrived, the Martial Cloud Dragon was already trapped by the formation without escape. All the twisting bodies were hard to look at.</p>
 <p>“What are these people?” Princess Jin Rou asked.</p>
 <p>Looking at this group of people, Chu Mu fell into deep thought. Why was it that a large group of people entered right after they left? And why were they entering?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They have snake marks on them so they likely are part of the high level faction Snake Dragon Faction of Demon Beast Palace.” Chu Mu recognized their backgrounds.</p>
 <p>Demon Beast Palace had many factions within it, of which include Snake Dragon Faction, Horned Armored Faction, and Demon Feather Faction as the main factions. Downwards, another few thousand factions were split off. This was what Demon Beast Palace Xiao Xiao told Chu Mu. Wupan Continent and Zhengming Continent’s demon beast palace were both split like this. The fact that they all have snake tattoos means that their identity is more or less confirmed.</p>
 <p>“Let me go help the Martial Cloud Dragon.” Chu Mu said.</p>
 <p>“En, let me create some mental attacks that ruin their formation.” Princess Jin Rou said.</p>
 <p>The two people split up their work. Chu Mu rode Night directly into the massive formation. While he flew, Chu Mu summoned the Ghost Monarch King!</p>
 <p>“Ghost Monarch, Monarch Ghost Transformation, attack!”</p>
 <p>As Night ran handsomely, aside Night appeared a column of rolling rocks that slammed straight towards the Snake Dragon Formation!</p>
 <p>Within the rolling rock tide, a massive curved sword, large as a mountain, appeared first. After that, the pillar-like Ghost Monarch King’s rock body followed!</p>
 <p>Ghost Monarch King appeared by Chu Mu and Night as a vanguard. A slash of its sword echoed through the skies!</p>
 <p>With the slash, a Snake Dragon in the outer ring didn’t dodge in time, and had its skull slashed off!</p>
 <p>“Beng!!!”</p>
 <p>The massive skull, as large as a house, fell in front of Night, drenched in blood!</p>
 <p>Night’s figure became a phantom that passed under the snake head!</p>
 <p>Shattering Dream!</p>
 <p>A cold glint passed through, piercing a Cyan Snake Dragon’s body.</p>
 <p>The Cyan Snake Dragon’s body shivered, its body falling away from the formation.</p>
 <p>“Ao!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon seized the opportunity and flapped its wings. It appeared right before the Cyan Snake Dragon and grabbed onto its tail!</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon used its power to pull the cyan Snake Dragon right out of the formation. Its body was at least a hundred meters long, yet its body was now tightly grasped in Martial Cloud Dragon’s hand like a rope. No matter how it struggled, it was dead!</p>
 <p>“Aoao!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The angry Martial Cloud Dragon ripped the cyan Snake Dragon aside. Immediately, it was ripped in two pieces, bleeding profusely from the center!!</p>
 <p>The blood splattered everywhere, causing Snake Dragon Faction to be shocked!</p>
 <p>“Ning!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an incredibly powerful mental voice poured into the Snake Dragons and soul pet trainers’ ears.</p>
 <p>This sound was like a high pitched whine from a vocalist. It was beautiful and alluring, yet this sound that drowned out the world had terrifying killing intent. Those with weak mental strengths could even have their souls immediately pierced!</p>
 <p>Soul pet trainer and Snake Dragons were shocked by this mental quake. Some of the soul pet trainers started bleeding from their ears, and the Snake Dragon Formation started falling into chaos.</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon was powerful and dominant. If not for the formation, how would it get restricted by these Snake Dragons?</p>
 <p>After the formation broke, Martial Cloud Dragon immediately became cruel, and slashed the Snake Dragons apart into flesh!</p>
 <p>“Back off, back off!!” Enforcer She let out a shout.</p>
 <p>This group of threatening Snake Dragons instantly scattered, no longer daring to compete against the powerful Martial Cloud Dragon.</p>
 <p>Snake Dragon Faction’s people escaped pretty quickly. The Martial Cloud Dragon only chased for a small distance before they all disappeared.</p>
 <p>There were four to five Snake Dragon corpses left on the ground. Old Li suddenly jumped out of Chu Mu’s soul pet space to claw out a soul crystal from one of the corpses.</p>
 <p>“Young master, you’re lucky, there’s a soul crystal!” Old Li smiled and said.</p>
 <p>These Snake Dragons were all near immortal rank or were pseudo immortal rank. Their soul crystals were extremely valuable already. When Chu Mu was protecting the cultivation diagram, he also met some immortal rank organisms. However, even after he killed them, he obtained no soul crystals. Yet, this time, after helping Martial Cloud Dragon, he managed to get one.</p>
 <p>“Bug type and beast type, young master should bring them back to Ye Qingzi and Ning Maner. Then, Zhan Ye’s immortal rank issue will be solved.” Old Li said.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu nodded and put away this unexpected fortune.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Martial Cloud Dragon’s massive body fell right in front of Chu Mu. Its cyan scales were still dripping with Snake Dragon blood. This scene could cause most people to shiver.</p>
 <p>“Dududu~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon’s little baby was on Martial Cloud Dragon’s head. It clearly recognized Chu Mu, and started jumping with excitement.</p>
 <p>The danger before didn’t affect little Martial Cloud Dragon at all. It was still like a little kid grabbing Mo Xie’s tail. Its two dragon fangs were exposed in the air, extremely cute.</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon also recognized Chu Mu. If not for Chu Mu’s sudden appearance destroying the Snake Dragon formation, Martial Cloud Dragon may really have an issue escaping. Thus, its gaze at Chu Mu was much friendlier as well.</p>
 <p>“Princess Jin Rou, can you tell it Imprint Valley is about to collapse, and ask if they’re willing to leave with us.” Chu Mu said to Princess Jin Rou.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Princess Jin Rou had the ability to read hearts, and also had the ability to communicate with soul pets.</p>
 <p>She floated onto Martial Cloud Dragon’s head and lightly put a hand on its forehead to transfer Chu Mu’s message.</p>
 <p>After a moment, Princess Jin Rou floated back to Chu Mu.</p>
 <p>“What’s up?”</p>
 <p>“Martial Cloud Dragon said that it also felt the spatial abnormalities and has been looking for a spatial tunnel out.” Princess Jin Rou said.</p>
 <p>Martial Cloud Dragon had lived in this place for a very long time. It didn’t care whether it would perish with the world, but it had to plan ahead for little Martial Cloud Dragon.</p>
 <p>This time, Chu Mu’s rescue made Martial Cloud Dragon trust Chu Mu to a certain extent.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let it come with me and we can go look for the Light King now.” Chu Mu said.</p>
 <p>The Martial Cloud Dragon was powerful. Normal immortal ranks weren’t really its match. With the Martial Cloud Dragon, even if Gate Master Han sent people after him, he would be relatively safe.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu couldn't go half-devil in Imprint Valley, so the Martial Cloud Dragon was good insurance for him.</p>
