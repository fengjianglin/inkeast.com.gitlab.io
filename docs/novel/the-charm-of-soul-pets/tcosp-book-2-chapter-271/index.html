 <p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter 271: Doubled Plot</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this voice float through, Chu Mu’s heart sank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu had never heard this voice before, but, he didn’t even need to think to know that it was the voice of the evil man Duan Xinhe, who fed a bunch of terrifying Gluttonous Insect Monsters!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s heart sank completely. He hadn’t predicted that Duan Xinhe would appear here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to guess. That kid that was burnt to ashes was with me. Originally, he wanted me to get rid of you, but in the end, he just foolishly believed that I would help him kill all of his competition like an idiot.” Duan Xinhe slowly walked out of the shadows, where light didn’t reach, his sharp face slowly emerging under the reflection of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe’s appearance wasn’t completely treacherous, but his pair of beast-like yellow eyes made one very uncomfortable. If one looked closely, one would definitely discover that his eyes were completely a copy of the Gluttonous Insect Monster eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this powerful soul pet trainer appear, Chu Mu could already feel the nearing of the soul reaper, because he couldn’t currently fight against a character such as Duan Xinhe right now. In fact, if his invisible soul pet used its full strength, it would be able to instantly kill all of Chu Mu’s soul pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, Chu Mu’s heart was pumping, but the more dangerous the situation, the more he had to stay calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An incantation was started. Chu Mu quietly retracted his two soul pets that could easily be killed, his Ice Air Fairy and Devil Tree Battle Soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe didn’t care whether Chu Mu was summoning or retracting soul pets. He only walked slowly forward with his hands behind his back, circling Chu Mu while stepping over flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak up, what identity do you have? A thing like the Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox isn’t something just anyone can have. If you didn’t get immensely lucky, then some extraordinary character must have gifted it to you.” Duan Xinhe wasn’t in a hurry to kill Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want the Hidden Dragon Egg?” Chu Mu said as calmly as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu knew, if he didn’t say his identity of young master, Duan Xinhe definitely wouldn’t even hesitate to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, even if he said his identity of soul palace young master, to seal off chances of the information getting out, he wouldn’t spare Chu Mu either. Since saying anything about his identity meant death, if Chu Mu continued down that topic, he would surely die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? You sure you aren’t just switching the topic just to live?” Duan Xinhe looked at Chu Mu patiently, occasionally still sticking a finger into his mouth to lick off the remaining scent of Fang Dan’s chest. Chu Mu’s heart was already pumping vigorously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe was definitely a ruthless fellow. With such a person standing in front of him, it wasn’t anything less than if a powerful soul pet like the Blue Galactic Demon Emperor were in front of him. The pressure brought by Duan Xinhe was huge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, no matter how powerful the opponent was, Chu Mu could only remain calm, calmly finding a reason for the powerful man to not kill him. Only then can he possibly become powerful enough to compete against him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me show you something. If you recognize it, then you will know I’m not lying.” Chu Mu opened his mouth to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, Chu Mu secretly opened his spatial ring and, from the rows of tidy soul cores, he found the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon egg lying in the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu of course wouldn’t give the egg straight up; that was just asking for death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu specially took the membrane outside of the egg that would shed almost every month and handed it to Duan Xinhe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe’s interest wasn’t that great, seeming to be sure that Chu Mu was just delaying the inevitable. However, Duan Xinhe didn’t mind wasting his time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took over the Hidden Dragon egg membrane and looked at it thoroughly. He didn’t seem to find anything special, so he specially put it aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu put his head down and quickly noticed a long nose extend out of thin air that sniffed at the egg outer membrane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First tell me what this is used for.” Duan Xinhe asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this the thing you’ve been looking for every day?” Chu Mu said calmly.</span><span style>“Hehe, me looking for a stupid bug cocoon membrane? I’d rather go and break women membranes down there. Speaking of which, I almost forgot. You seem to have a decent woman by you as well, why isn’t she with you right now?” Duan Xinhe’s eyes glowed with lust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu knew Duan Xinhe was talking about Ye Qingzi. The plan of water attack was Ye Qingzi’s idea, so Duan Xinhe definitely hated her to the bone too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, from Duan Xinhe’s eyes, Chu Mu could understand exactly what he wanted to do to Ye Qingzi. This made Chu Mu have a wave of incredible anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you’re mad?” Hahaha, I was starting to think you were emotionless, acting so calm even after seeing an evil man like me. Turns out you do have emotions.” Duan Xinhe said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your interest in women are at most lust. I admit I worry for that woman. If you harm her, or me, you will die within a year for sure.” Chu Mu calmed his anger and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I say this not to make you scared of the consequences. I only want to tell you that killing me isn’t useful for you. Two reasons. First, the faction behind me could squash you easily, so don’t hope to ever live safely ever again. Second, I can give you the item you’ve always wanted in exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t harm you and that girl?” Duan Xinhe interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The thing I’ve always wanted, do you mean the Cyan Hidden Dragon egg?” Duan Xinhe wasn’t stupid, quickly guessing what Chu Mu was speaking of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu nodded again. “The item on your hands is the most outer membrane layer of the Cyan Hidden Dragon Egg.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe picked up the dried membrane again and smelled it, as if communicating with his own soul pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before, when the Cyan Hidden Dragon appeared in Li City, Duan Xinhe’s Hundred Mother had made contact with the Cyan Hidden Dragon, so the Hundred Mother could smell the Cyan Dragon’s scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thing Chu Mu pulled out was truly the Cyan Hidden Dragon egg’s membrane, so Duan Xinhe naturally could confirm it. He looked at Chu Mu in a special way, not understanding how Chu Mu came to have it. “How did you get it?” Duan Xinhe asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I went looking for it before. The Innards of a God has an entrance only I know the way into. I also know how to take the Hidden Dragon Egg without waking the dragon. The benefit I can provide you is getting the egg.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe started laughing, but it gave off a hair-raising feel. Chu Mu could even feel his Gluttonous Insect Monster starting to laugh eccentrically, strangely similar to its master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s eyes stared right at Duan Xinhe. At this moment, he was observing Duan Xinhe’s eyes. The moment Duan Xinhe revealed a hint of killing intent, Chu Mu would unhesitatingly release the white demonic devil flames inside him and become a half devil. Any other way, no matter he or his soul pets, would easily die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I believe you? Only I know where the Cyan Hidden Dragon is right now. I only need to wait slowly before the thing is mine.” Duan Xinhe was clearly somewhat convinced already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, Duan Xinhe did really want to get the Cyan Hidden Dragon egg. But, the Innards of a God aren’t that easy to enter. It was still very difficult of Duan Xinhe wanted to truly get it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let him live for a while. It’s no big deal anyways. Maybe the kid actually has a way.” Duan XInhe thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you think you’re very safe right now, then you’re too naive. Don’t you know that your life has already become the key to obtaining the Cyan Hidden Dragon Egg? Since you are a team with Yu He, presumably he told you long ago.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe looked slightly confused before he turned into a cold sneer, “You think I would believe your nonsense?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Duan Xinhe seeming to be ignorant of his wanted status by all the factions, Chu Mu instead laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to laugh about!” Duan Xinhe shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like we’ve all been played by the kid Yu He. Li old City Master split this task in three, respectively manned by the young generation, adult generation, and old generation. The young generation is in charge of finding the Cyan Dragon. Those who find it earn five million gold as reward. The adult generation is in charge of killing you. The person who kills you can have the egg. The old generation are in charge of taming the Cyan Hidden Dragon itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous!” Duan Xinhe laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You don’t believe me? I can be sure that the Elemental Sect adult generation experts are here already. Send any one of your Gluttonous Insect Monsters outside to check.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe didn’t completely believe Chu Mu’s words, so he indeed sent a patrolling Gluttonous Insect Monster that was underground up to check. After not long, the message quickly was sent, using special sonic communications, back to Duan Xinhe. His face immediately darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That Yu He truly is a bastard!” Duan Xinhe said with clenched teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He indeed was a terrifying plotter. Not only did he think of using Duan Xinhe to get rid of Chu Mu, he even timed it and sent the message to Elemental Sect. After Duan Xinhe killed Chu Mu, he wanted the people of Elemental Sect to kill Duan Xinhe. This way, the dragon egg would fall in their hands!</span></p>
