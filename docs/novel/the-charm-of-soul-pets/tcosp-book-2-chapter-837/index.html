 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The devil transformation was real. The story is a bit long. What about Qingzi, I want to see her. Then I’ll talk to you about it.” Chu Mu couldn’t wait to see Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, I’ll go call her now. You brat, you nearly ruined my sister!” Ye Wansheng hastily turned around and cursed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as Ye Wansheng took a step, he suddenly realized something. He stopped and said: “No, you can’t see her right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why not?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s currently at a very crucial stage of concoction and needs to be extremely calm. Not only will this make her hard work and suffering go to waste, but it could also recoil onto her body. Do you think that if someone who should have died appeared in front of her, she would be able to remain calm?” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter?” Chu Mu asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When soul teachers were concocting, they were like a soul pet trainer trying to breakthrough their soul remembrance. They couldn’t be disturbed or be distracted. Chu Mu understood this. However, why would it potentially recoil onto her body while concocting?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… ai, whatever, it’s best if you don’t see her right now, because it may affect her state of mind.” sighed Ye Wansheng. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me.” Chu Mu was a bit anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It’s best if I tell you a few other things first. It’s a bit of a long story too. You guys haven’t seen each other for such a long time so there’s lack of time for me to tell you this.” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure.” Chu Mu saw that Ye Wansheng was serious so he didn’t persist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Ye Qingzi was concocting behind closed doors, he definitely didn’t want to disturb her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng led him to the great hall, and had the medicine boy retreat. He began to tell him about the matters that happened these past years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should know that the spirit item that was considered trash and was the ultimate honor of the second grade was actually the soul ability inheritance that my teacher left for Qingzi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I guessed as much.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, Ye Wansheng didn’t hide the background of him or his sister as he began to narrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The legends are that my teacher, Ying Rong, has soul abilities that surpass his teacher, Yang Que - the King of Soul Teachers… but this isn’t a legend, it’s the truth!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His soul abilities are unparalleled in this world. The reason why people call him the “Undying Immortal” is only because my teacher has shown his true abilities when it comes to healing others. As for concocting, refining, combining spirit crystals and compounding, he has never truly revealed his skills…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t know much about Ying Rong. It was only from Ye Wansheng that Chu Mu learned that Ying Rong was a genius with ultra high aptitude in multiple areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of soul abilities, he had reached great heights. Even his teacher, Yang Que, was unable to concoct emperor rank spirit items so easily like him. Moreover, he was even able to concoct peak emperor rank things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Yang Que was called the King of Soul Teachers was because he controlled Soul City, which was comparable to a realm city. However, his highest accomplishment was limited to concocting a peak emperor rank spirit item that only had a certain percentage of having effect. Contrarily, if Ying Rong had a bit more time, he would be able to surpass Yang Que.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the heavens envied geniuses just as humans envied geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, as the senior martial brother, Zhu Chao was petty-minded and took advantage of an event called “Sealed Mouth”. He employed a few tricks and set up Ying Rong, causing Ying Rong to become one of Soul Alliance’s Sealed Mouth targets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Ying Rong concealed his identity and no longer dared to appear in this world. Instead, he began to focus on cultivating the Ye Family brother and sister.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ying Rong was also an outstanding soul pet trainer on top of being a soul teacher with amazing soul abilities. He imparted two abilities each to Ye Wansheng and Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had very high talent when it came to soul abilities and was Ying Rong’s only inheritor. In truth, at the beginning, Ying Rong, had conducted a test for each of their soul ability talent and found that Ye Wansheng was lacking in this area. Therefore, he had made Ye Qingzi as his inheritor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ying Rong was strict towards Ye Qingzi while lenient towards Ye Wansheng. The reason for this was because Ye Qingzi was his true inheritor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps Ying Rong himself knew that his days were numbered, so he used soul remembrance to brand ancient incantations on special tools. Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng were still young and were unable to protect these tools that contained the inheritance branding. Therefore, he gave them to two people to look over. If something happened to him, he would have Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng take them from these two people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who were these two people?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One was my teacher’s close friend, Chu Tianmang, who was an outstanding talent 20 years ago. He has the same surname as you. The other is Yang Que…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait wait, wait wait, who did you just say it was?” Chu Mu was stunned and hastily interrupted Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Tianmang. What, do you know him?” Ye Wansheng looked at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s my father.” Chu Mu said in a low voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu truly never expected that his father would be close friends with Ying Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, thinking about it again, Chu Tianmang and Ying Rong had both been a part of Tianxia City’s five peak young experts. Presumably, they had gotten to know each other then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a coincidence…” Ye Wansheng couldn’t help but smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, there weren’t many other odd things in this story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng had appeared in Tianxia Realm’s Western Kingdom, they wanted to find Chu Tianmang to take back the inheritance tool that their teacher had left for him. They hoped that they could obtain Chu Tianmang’s protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after they inquired about him, they discovered that this expert whose fame had even surpassed Ying Rong in the past had fallen even more than their teacher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng arrived at Luo Region, it was when the Chu Family was migrating. Chu Tianmang had already left Western Kingdom and the two of them didn’t know the misfortune that had befallen the Chu Family. Nor were they willing to return empty handed after traveling a thousand miles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, the brother and sister pair began to arduously search until finally, when they approached Western Kingdom, they found Chu Ning and Chu Xing, who were training in the wilderness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After inquiring from him, they confirmed Chu Tianmang’s fall and then afterward, Chu Mu appeared in front of Chu Xing and Chu Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng who no longer had much hope in Chu Tianmang naturally did not care if Chu Mu was related to Chu Tianmang. Thus, they could only continue to increase their strength through training like Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why they had never told this to Chu Mu was because Ying Rong had told them that they had to make this inheritance matter a secret among secrets. They could not tell a third party. The other reason was because Chu Mu himself had a huge pile of secrets and hadn’t actually told them his real identity seriously. For a while, he was Chu Mu and for another while he was Chu Chen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching Tianxia City, Ye Qingzi was able to use the soul remembrance on the incantation to decipher that the tool Chu Tianmang had lost was in Tianxia City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After searching, the two of them joyously discovered that this important and precious tool that they had lost was unexpectedly being used to guard a spirit item. This spirit item was also going to become the ultimate honor of the second grade and would appear before the Battle of the Realm began!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Ye Qingzi had told him that she needed obtain the second grade ultimate honor spirit item. The spirit item wasn’t actually of value to her. Instead, the real value lay in the tool that held the spirit item!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My farther’s spatial ring was stripped by Soul Alliance, I believe. Thus, I would presume that the objects inside were taken by someone and the incongruous tool became a random object…” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, fortunately, our teacher gave us another method to find the tools. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to detect the items even if they were given to us.” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, does the first place reward for the spirit ability competition have something to do with the second tool?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, the soul ability competition occurs every five years and the tool that has held the first place prize has always been known as the Spirit Vessel, a historical tool. This is the first time the Spirit Vessel has been used to contain the spirit item and the meaning is rather significant because it probably will not be changed and will adhere to it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then teacher became Yang Que’s disciple because he obtained first place in the soul ability competition. In truth, teacher’s soul abilities then were extremely high. However, as a person he was rather low key, so taking a teacher was just a means of finding support.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When teacher obtained this tool, his used an incantation to brand this historical tool with his soul ability method that surpassed Yang Que’s soul ability method. He then gave it back to Soul City and told Qingzi that only by obtaining this honor would she have the qualifications to learn his true high rank soul ability.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Ye Wansheng looked at the medicine room which Ye Qingzi had set up restrictions on. His face showed a complicated expression as he sighed:</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qingzi has always worked hard to obtain the Spirit Vessel. It is her life’s goal and its meaning is extremely important and is the second will that her teacher left for her to complete. In these few years, she has exhausted her own heart’s blood to accomplish this. If you see her haggardness, you’ll be able to understand how hard she has worked just for this Spirit Vessel. Right now, she’s very close to it… so…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Chu Mu earnestly nodded his head and said: “Don’t worry, even if it’s pressing, I may as well wait a few more days. When Qingzi is able to obtain the Spirit Vessel, I’ll appear again and celebrate with her.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You understand well. I’m sure that that day will be a day that is hard to forget.” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After talking a long time with Ye Wansheng, in order to not disturb Ye Qingzi, Chu Mu got up and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these next few days, Chu Mu would silently watch over her…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching Chu Mu leave, a smile appeared on Ye Wansheng’s face as he muttered:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi, I already can’t wait to see you fulfill your dream of obtaining the Spirit Vessel and the person you love standing in front of you… you will definitely cry like a kid… have a good cry, eh. There’s no need to try and be brave.”&nbsp;</span></p>
