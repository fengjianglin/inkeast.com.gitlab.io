 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second day, the Demon Beast Palace sect gate master personally visited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This gate master was an older middle aged man. He wore a brown long roab and the first thing he did when he entered the mountain villa was tactfully ask for forgiveness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There really was an honored guest yesterday. I hope that Young Lady Xiao Xiao can forgive me.” said the Demon Beast Palace gate master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine, it’s fine. I happen to have a few things to ask you.” Xiao Xiao waved her hand and let the old gate master sit next to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please ask, young lady.” said the old gate master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My senior martial brothers are currently investigating the people that had committed the Quiet Forest crime. I heard my Uncle Sun say that you had some information, so I came to ask.” said Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it’s Xuan Master Sun’s interest…” when the old gate master heard Xiao Xiao use Xuan Master Sun’s name, he immediately nodded his head and said: “I don’t have much information, but I found something a few years ago in the jurisdiction I was administering.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me.” said Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, there was a group of people among them that wasn’t in Quiet Forest. Instead, this group was chasing a group of creatures fleeing from the forest. There were about 50 of them. When these creatures passed by Heaven Boundary Monument, they were intercepted and a huge battle broke out there.” said the old gate master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That happened? Tell us the details.” Xiao Xiao’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Quiet Forest crisis happened, many creatures had fled Quiet Forest. Yet, 50 of these creatures had been pursued all the way from Quiet Forest until Lin City. Clearly, these 50 creatures had something very important on them. Perhaps the Messiah Tree’s seed was among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because there were too many experts then and my strength was meager, I could only watch from afar. I didn’t dare get near and my knowledge was very limited.” said the old gate master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What were you afraid of? You are an immortal rank person.” Xiao Xiao said, dissatisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old gate master’s face went red. He coughed and continued: “Young Lady Xiao Xiao, the scene was very chaotic and regardless if it were the 50 creatures from Quiet Forest or those evil men, they were all very strong.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you recognize anyone?” immediately asked Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… this old man cannot say…” said the gate master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why can’t you say?!” immediately pressed Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Xuan Master Sun personally came to ask, I could tell him since this matter involves… oh, that’s right. The honored guest this time is Upper Official He from Divine Sect. He’s also investigating this matter. Would Young Lady Xiao like me to introduce him?” said the old gatemaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have any interest. What else do you know?” asked Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Pang Yue moved up to Chu Mu and asked: “What’s an upper official?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Divine Sect is divided into master, upper, middle and lower officials. Upper officials should be the highest title for those in the spirit dominator rank.” explained Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered Lu Yuqin was a master official. Chu Mu had previously thought Lu Yuqin had peak dominator rank strength. Later, he learned that in order to obtain the master official position, one had to be an immortal rank expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Lu Yuqin had wanted to forcibly take away the spectral Jinrou, there really wouldn’t have been anyone capable of stopping her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this also showed how Divine Sect’s Lu Yuqin was very honorable. If it were another immortal rank expert, why would they care about honor?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect’s positions were normally higher than those in other factions. Although Demon Beast Palace’s old gate master was an immortal expert, he should have sat equal to Divine Sect’s master officials. However, due to the high status of Divine Sect, even though an upper official was the one who came here, the old gate master had to personally greet him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao continued to try and pry information. However, at the same moment, Ye Wansheng and Prince Chao who were strolling around the sect came back with angry expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them had gone out early in the morning to find a place to spar. Who knew what happened, but when they returned, they were angry and their voices could be heard even from the front courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who was he. Really… what is he playing at. If it weren’t for so many people with him, I would’ve beat him up already!” Ye Wansheng’s face was full of grievances.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. How did us sparring bother him at all. Didn’t we just shatter the barrier and scare those women behind him? We even went up and apologized.” Chao Lengchuan also looked unhappy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you remember his name?” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know. I just know the people around him were calling him He something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them spoke as they entered the main hall. But as they entered, the old gate master, Chu Mu, Xiao Xiao and Pang Yue all looked with wide open eyes at them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old sect master’s smiling face had frozen and he quietly asked: “The one you’re talking of is Upper Official He?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes yes yes, that’s him. I heard the people around him call him that. I remember now…. Uncle, don’t you feel he’s also very unpleasant?” Ye Wansheng instantly remembered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old gate master’s face turned black.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them just had to go provoke the person from Divine Sect!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You didn’t get into too big of a conflict, right?” the old gate master calmed himself and asked with a black face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It wasn’t anything. We just cursed him a few times.” said Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s fine then…” the old gate master’s complexion eased a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prince Chao, you’re so tolerant. Even when humiliated, how could you just curse him a few times? When I apologized, I secretly spilled a bit of poison flea powder. I’m going to guess he’s scratching through his tender skin right now. Hahaha.” scummily laughed Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is poison flea powder?” asked Chao Lengchuan, confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s a unique poison powder. It’s colorless and odorless. It’s also very hard to detect when using soul remembrance. It was something my younger sister concocted for herself to use on classless and vile men who didn’t stop bothering her. I’m sure you can imagine how glorious it is to sprinkle some of that flea powder on someone else which will attract those tiny poisonous insects. We’re on a mountain right now and small poisonous insects are all over a mountain. If the small poisonous insects from all over the mountain run to him, even if they don’t bite him to death, he’ll have lost a layer of his skin within the hour!” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Ye Wansheng was speaking, he had even casually walked next to the old gate master and sat down. He continued to vividly narrate how he had secretly sprinkled the poison flea powder onto the man named He.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng was a thick-skinned fellow, and didn’t realize that the four people already sitting down had strange expressions. Moreover, Chao Lengchuan who was a little slow himself was just foolishly nodding his head with vigour, telling Ye Wansheng that this was a great trick! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, as he listened to Ye Wansheng tell them about the poison flea powder, Chu Mu felt uncomfortable all over…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Poison flea powder that even soul remembrance couldn’t detect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What on earth was Qingzi concocting this for?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Chu Mu realized if he made Qingzi angry one day, he could die a miserable death while Qingzi faintly smiled with cold intentions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally Ye Qingzi was a girl who could hold back her temper. But he slept with her every night and what if one day she had a sudden impulse to do something to him…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Mu was thinking that he needed to treat Ye Qingzi better in the future, the old gate master whose hairs were standing on end from Ye Wansheng could no longer sit still. He got up and hastily exited the mountain vila. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, this Uncle is definitely going to go see how miserable that man surnamed He is. Haha, he’s so old but can really hold a grudge! I would guess he really hates that man surnamed Jia, otherwise, why would he be so emotional when I just spoke.” laughed Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The two of you…” Pang Yue didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao didn’t think anything of it and pestered Ye Wansheng for any more of the poison flea powder. She could also use it to deal with lechers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, Xiao Xiao, did you find out anything?” Ye Wansheng asked as he gave the poison flea powder to Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We only learned that there was a group of people chasing 50 soul pets from Quiet Forest. They also fought a battle at Heaven Boundary Monument. That old man really is something. What would it matter if he told us. I dare say he definitely knows who was among that group of people.” Xiao Xiao carefully put away the poison flea powder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The old gate master was actually just using his eyes to silently hint something to you.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was hinting something to me? HInting what?” Xiao Xiao asked, confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was hinting to you that there were people from Demon Beast Palace among that group.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had detected this detail, but unfortunately Xiao Xiao wasn’t as perceptive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“People from our Demon Beast Palace? Oh? Could our Demon Beast Palace’s people have participated in this event…” said Xiao Xiao with a face full of shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Probably. Xuan Teacher Sun had also secretly told us this.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiao Xiao thought back to what Xuan Teacher Sun had said, she immediately understood. However, this news greatly shocked her. She was a member of Demon Beast Palace and Demon Beast Palace was criticizing this event. How would she imagine there were people in Demon Beast Sect participating in this criminal event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, Chu Mu, where are you going?” Xiao Xiao saw that Chu Mu had stood up and was puzzle why.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going to look at the Heaven Boundary Monument.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered Hai Qie telling him that in Wan City, there was a huge group of people chasing over 20 wild soul pets which were trying their best to protect a young girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The same thing had happened here at the Heaven Boundary Monument. Did that mean when Ning Maner and those guardians fled Quiet Forest, they fled along this path and were intercepted at Heaven Boundary Monument before being reduced from their original 50 to 20?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ning Maner fled to New Moon Land, she didn’t have the Messiah Tree seed on her. If Ning Maner had taken the Messiah Tree seed when she fled Quiet Forest, there was a chance she could have hidden it somewhere as she fled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu felt that Heaven Boundary Monument was likely to be a great place to hide the seed. Indeed, Ning Maner’s path of escape had taken her to Lin City’s Heaven Boundary Monument and then to New Moon Land. And New Moon Land also had a Heavenly Boundary Monument.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this wasn’t just a coincidence, there was probably a reason behind this.&nbsp;</span></p>
