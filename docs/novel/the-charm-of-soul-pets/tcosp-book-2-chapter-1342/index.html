 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The darkness persisted for half a day. When the thick dark aura dissipated, it was night already.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As New Moon Land developed, strange things would occasionally happen in Wanxiang City. At the beginning, the Palaces would have to come out and pacify the citizens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But eventually, the citizens grew used to it. Regulations in the Palaces said that they had to come out and give an explanation, but unfortunately, this time, the experts of the Palaces didn’t know how to explain the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep inside the courtyard, Cloud Gate’s Old Man stroked his beard and muttered: “It should be Bai Yu who broke through. He’s been bitterly training in Nightmare Holy Region for many years. He’s definitely encountered something fortuitous. He had the highest chance of breaking through. Only, why did he release a darkness attribute?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Gate’s Old Man thought that Bai Yu had the highest chance of breaking through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After him, Liu Binglan was the only person in this world with an independent training space. She would probably be able to enter the immortal rank since her spirit remembrance was extremely high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Liu Binglan didn’t have any dark type soul pets, and her soul pets were lacking a bit of maturity. Thus, Cloud Gate’s Old Man excluded her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other experts in Wanxiang City, he had seen them all before, but they didn’t have a high chance of breaking through. The immortal rank wasn’t something so easily crossed into!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t need to guess. She knew that the person who caused the huge disturbance was Chu Mu. When she went to Chu Mu’s courtyard, she could hear his carefree laughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother’s Dream Beast entered the immortal rank!” a smile rose on Ning Maner’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The immortal rank?” an expression of shock appeared on Liu Binglan’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan often interacted with foreign guests, and she learned about the immortal rank from them. Among them, many who were high class dominator experts and pledged their allegiance to New Moon Land spoke with expressions of reverence when mentioning the immortal rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan herself was curious as to how strong the immortal rank was. Indeed, why were these arrogant experts so filial and respectful in front of them?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had a coincidental opportunity to talk with Cloud Gate’s Old Man about training. He had told her that the Six Star Space was like the Holy Regions, and had a lot of space to be unearthed. She only needed to find a way, and she would have hope of entering the immortal rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t have many soul pets so when cultivating, she could focus on these few soul pets. Thus, her soul pets were all rather highly ranked. However, she was still a ways away from the immortal rank. At least, she still hadn’t felt the doorstep into that rank yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chu Mu, he was also an extremely fast cultivator. He had many soul pets, but their powers were very equal. Moreover, he was the first person to enter the immortal rank from New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Cloud Gate’s Old Man who oversaw New Moon Land like a great buddha, and now adding on Chu Mu’s breakthrough, New Moon Land’s status was no longer inferior to some small border cities!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this world dictated by strength, it was hard to find a place without absolute strength. Chu Mu’s breakthrough essentially allowed New Moon Land to ascend a realm. The banner of the Palaces could be planted in other border cities, and the nearby regions probably wouldn’t dare find trouble for New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty Female Supreme, there are a few people who claim to be from Zhengming Continent’s Territory Institution. They are unwilling to talk with our foreign receivers, and only wish to see you.” reported a holy guard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhengming Continent’s Territory Institution?” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan furrowed her brows and sunk into thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had previously interacted with people from a Territory Institution. While the surrounding regions had wanted to dip their fingers into New Moon Land’s forbidden region administration rights, Territory Institution had acted as the arbitrator. Every few days, a few of Liu Binglan’s subordinates would have to go to them to bring them historical documents confirming that the forbidden regions were a part of New Moon Land’s territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Territory Institutions that interacted with New Moon Land were mostly from realms. The highest-ranked one was from Jia Border. But Jia Border was only a first rank border territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the people this time had come from Zhengming Continent’s Territory Institution!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that the people who had come were the highest-ranked Territory Administrators in Zhengming Continent. These Territory Administrators were administrators of Zhengming Continent’s border ranked territories. Why would they suddenly come a long way from Zhengming Main City to this distant place?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring them to the meeting palace.” Liu Binglan said to the holy guard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since people from the highest-ranked Territory Institution had come, there was definitely something important and Liu Binglan felt that she had to personally meet them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When night fell, Chu Mu couldn’t hold back the excitement in his heart, and immediately urged Night, which had just broken into the immortal rank, to run through the entire New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seemingly boundless New Moon Land of the past had now become a place only as large as his palm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From midnight until daybreak, Chu Mu rushed from Wanxiang City to Western Kingdom, then to the new Seven Color City to see a few of the late bloomers of the Chu Family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Western Kingdom was completely different from before. Seven Color City had become a kingdom city, and the administrator was Chu Tianheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chu Family couldn’t be considered a large family clan. But it had many members and their development was steady. Chu Mu didn’t interfere much either. Moreover, he didn’t feel like he had to interfere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For his Uncle Chu Tianheng, developing a tiny territory into a famous big city was far more enjoyable than having Chu Mu instantly make him Tianxia City’s City Lord with a single order.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been many years since he had returned, and Chu Mu discovered that younger cousin Chu Yiyi had already gotten married to someone from outside the realm. They didn’t know where he had brought her to, but every once in awhile, they would return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Ying had also gotten married, and was now in Tianxia City. Chu Mu knew the person who she had married. It was Palace Lord Yu’s disciple, Shang Heng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had been in Tianxia City, Chu Mu knew Shang Heng relatively well, and he heard that he was now the palace administrator of Tianxia City’s Soul Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was very curious as to how the two of them got together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, what rank is your Night Dream Beast? The aura it’s emitting makes my entire body feel ice-cold. I also feel that even its gaze might be able to kill me.” said Chu Tianheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It just entered the immortal rank. I was excited about this so I had Night go from Wanxiang City to Western Kingdom. I just wanted to see how fast it was now.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immortal rank?” Chu Tianheng evidently hadn’t heard of this rank. He probably knew of his own ignorance and inexperience so he asked: “How many days did it take?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not even 12 hours,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianheng was stunned, and wondered if he had heard incorrectly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even spirit emperor experts like him needed a year to reach Western Kingdom from Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu’s Night Thunder Dream Beast had done it in 12 hours. How fast was that!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianheng bitterly laughed and said: “It seems that the world is truly much larger than we think. Compared to you, I suddenly feel that the things I’ve done are insignificant.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t say that.” consoled Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I’m just saying. But I should have known that you and your father wouldn’t be constrained by our small family.” at this point, Chu Tianheng suddenly thought of something and said: “Speaking of which, do you have any news of Tianmang?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been many years, and Chu Mu himself also didn’t remember much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had returned from Prison Island, Chu Mu had come to see his father with excitement to tell him that he had held on and survived; moreover, that he had become an expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as time passed, he slowly climbed up from the negligible servant and warrior ranks to the present immortal rank. Yet, he was never able to see him. The wish to see him had not only not dissipated from the long time period, but had instead grown more urgent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“About two or three years ago, an extra bundle of flowers appeared on your grandfather’s grave. The soil also had light kneeling marks. I wonder if the person who came to pay respects to your grandfather was Tianmang. Additionally, for the next few days, I felt as if someone was watching us from afar. Tianren also felt the same. However, the feeling quickly dissipated.” said Chu Tianmang in a low voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going to find him this time when I go to Zhengming Main City.” earnestly said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, Chu Mu felt that his father was purposefully avoiding people that he knew.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Alliance Master Ling Chan was killed, Mu Qingyi had encountered him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he arrived in Cloud Realm, Chu Mu had obtained a bit of information on him from Dark Sect’s arrest warrant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he learned more about him from Cloud Gate’s Old Man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, he learned from Uncle Chu Tianheng that he could have come back here two or three years ago to pay respect to his foster father, Chu Ming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The signs all pointed to him being safe and sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Chu Mu didn’t understand why he was avoiding him and hiding, unwilling to appear in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Carrying this confusion, Chu Mu left Western Kingdom and returned to Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he returned to Wanxiang City, Chu Mu couldn’t hold back the confusion, and went to tFemale Supreme’s palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan would always cultivate here during the night. When she knew Chu Mu had come, she temporarily stopped her cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu told the information he learned from Chu Tianheng to Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it was two or three years ago…” Liu Binglan earnestly tried to remember. She suddenly grasped something in her memories and said: “If that’s the case, I really did encounter a strange person wearing black monk garb two or three years ago. For a few consecutive days, I would always see him around. I guessed at the time that it was your father so I went to a pavilion, waiting for him to appear. But he never did appear. I think you had just left for the Eternal Ocean then…” &nbsp;</span></p>
