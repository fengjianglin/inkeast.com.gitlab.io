Blood natural wood appeared on the surface of the ground and promptly, the ground was transformed into a layer of space created by intertwining tree roots. These cyan colored and red tinted branches bound the Ancient Wind Spirit the moment the ground disappeared before dragging it underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tenth phase Storm Fairies continued to hover in the air. After the trap suddenly appeared, they were at a loss for a second before they reacted. They immediately chanted an incantation, wanting to use the violent wind strength to completely disintegrate the branches!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Storm Fairies were already in a trap, so how could the Devil Tree Battle Soldier give them a chance to use techniques. Quickly, it trapped the tenth phase Storm Fairies together and also dragged them twenty meters underground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hu!!! Hu!!!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding tenth phase Storm Fairies were all protecting the Ancient Wind Fairy, because its existence was the thing that could truly preserve the storm area, thus supporting the entirety of the enormous wind type fairy species. After the Ancient Wind Spirit let out a cry for help, the other ten Storm Fairies’ eyes instantly turned angry. They all floated over to the trap and began to chant incantations!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo Xie, get rid of that tenth phase Storm Fairy. Devil Tree Battle Soldier open up a path in front. Ghost King, block up the path and don’t let those wind type techniques make their way over!” Chu Mu gave his three soul pets orders in one breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Underneath the ground, the tenth phase Storm Fairies no longer had the environment advantage, and their fighting strength would definitely fall by twenty to thirty percent. Moreover, any wind type technique would be obstructed by the thick rock layer, decreasing its might by over half. In such circumstances, Mo Xie fighting against one tenth phase Storm Fairy by herself was no problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie’s attack strength had always been very strong; furthermore with the Ghost King’s aid, Mo Xie would not be obstructed by the rock layer and could use her full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wind type soul pets inherently had weak defense. When they were able to move to a long range, they would be close to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Royal Flame Claw!” sharp claws streaked across the tenth phase Storm Fairy, and two different flames simultaneously seeped into its body and began burning it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tenth phase Storm Fairy let out an angry yell. The black chaotic wind on its body began to rotate and, as it chanted, the wind transformed into a wild energy that could shatter the surrounding rock layer as it began to expand. The energy was an attempt to crush the rock layer into smithereens!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Mo Xie was extremely agile and the moment the Storm Fairy used its technique, she decisively retreated. Under the Ghost King’s protection, she retreated back to deep rock layer. She waited as the Storm Fairy’s technique expanded until its power began to weaken before suddenly jumping out of the rock layer and launch an attack at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie had reached the eighth phase third stage, and her fighting strength was comparable to a ninth phase commander. This Storm Fairy’s defense was inherently weak so how could it bear Mo Xie’s multiple attacks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quickly, this Storm Fairy began to gradually dissipate under the tragedy of Mo Xie’s claws on the rocky ground. It became a ball of senseless chaotic wind, and the wind type soul core broke off from its body, falling onto the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie was very good at understanding others. She knew that Chu Mu lacked money and that this tenth phase Storm Fairy’s soul core didn’t have a low value. She swept it up with her tail and took it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo Xie, leave!” Chu Mu said to Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Mo Xie were still nine tenth phase Storm Fairies. These nine Storm Fairies were all gathered together and their techniques were still extremely abnormal. They were capable of using violent wind to blow up the ground; Chu Mu naturally realized this so he didn’t have Mo Xie zealously continue to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost King was behind. As a rock type user, its middle stage dark crystal rock was of vital use right now. The attacks of the nine tenth phase Storm Fairies could ostensibly all be stopped if it used a layer of rock to block it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Layers of rock were continuously moving under its control and it managed to firmly separate Chu Mu and these tenth phase Storm Fairies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the techniques of tenth phase Storm Fairy’s were still rather astonishing. Although they were in a twenty meter deep layer of rock, they were still able to forcibly blow it apart with a storm. This large area of ground practically became a layer of air and if it was slightly stronger, perhaps the entire ground would have collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s goal was very clear. As long as he could obtain the Ancient Wind Fairy, he would decisively flee. He absolutely wouldn’t waste excessive fighting strength on these tenth phase Storm Fairies. After all, besides this mission, he still had an extremely long fight after this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s roots were extremely quick at digging and splitting apart the ground. The Ghost King covering their backs with rocks was also able to keep up with the splitting done by the tenth phase Storm Fairies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gradually, Chu mu was able to feel the breaking rock layer behind him become weaker and weaker. Finally, he could only hear slight ground vibrations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, you’re quite far away from them. You can go up to the ground, otherwise it’ll take forever before you exit this storm area.” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu shook his head and said: “These tenth phase Storm Fairies are exceptionally smart. I’m sure that they won’t be stupid enough to continue chasing me underground. Perhaps there is already a large group of Storm Fairies waiting for me on the surface.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lesson just given to Mo Xie made Chu Mu realize that there were many times he couldn't use normal intellect to measure a soul pet. In fact, there were many soul pets that were extremely crafty and extremely troublesome. This was especially the case for these tenth phase Storm Fairies that had stayed here for so many years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reality was just as Chu MU had guessed. On the surface, ostensibly all the Wind Fairies and Storm Fairies were following the restless underground movement. It could be said that they had made it so that the entire area had been cut off and was impenetrable. As long as Chu Mu dared show his head out from underground, these angry guards would use their strongest ninth rank wind type techniques to punish this evil human, Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hu~~~ Hu~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tenth phase Wind Fairies numbered at least 30, while there were approximately 20 Storm Fairies including the nine from before. Although the number of soul pets wasn’t that many, each one of them had extremely strong fighting strength. The moment they came together, they would bring a destructive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu indeed had remained calm. Chu Mu had already endured an entire day twenty meters underground waiting for the Ancient Wind fairy to walk into the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s trap, before finally making his move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, in order to take the Ancient Wind Fairy, Chu Mu also possessed extremely patience. He stayed like this underground and used an exceptionally slow speed to gradually move outside of the storm area. Before actually entering a safe place, Chu Mu would not come to the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, for even more safety, Chu Mu intentionally had the Devil Tree battle Soldier continue to dig deeper to prevent the Wind Fairy species soul pets from unearthing the ground with their concentrated strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a fear of Chu Mu didn’t actually happen. Perhaps when the wind strength was engulfing the area could the ground be unearthed a few layers, but reaching the rock layer thirty meters under was practically impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

His two sharp eyes were rigidly fixated on the surrounding as he wanted to find which fellow that came to steal the treasure!</span></p>

Lu Shanli was very proficient at dealing with things like this, but this Nightmare Palace senior never expected that the thing slowly approaching were all the tenth phase Wind Fairies and Storm Fairies in the storm area.
