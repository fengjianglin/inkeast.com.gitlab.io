 <p>Countless streams of blood gathered together, becoming ribbons of restricting bands that covered the Black Nightmare’s body.</p>
 <p>The Ghost Blood Diagram let out waves of screeches. The diagram kept pushing downwards, with its power getting more powerful as time passed!</p>
 <p>The Black Nightmare had already lost both its arms, so angrily, it could only use its spatial control and devil flames to compete against this diagram.</p>
 <p>The Five Blood Ghosts were still frenziedly spitting blood at the diagram. The more blood, the more vibrant the diagram was, and the more powerful the restriction, sealing, and shattering power was!</p>
 <p>“Nie!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Black Nightmare let out a crazy cry. Its eyes were fixed on the Messiah Tree because the Feather Demons were nearing Ning Maner.</p>
 <p>However, the appearance of the Ghost Blood Diagram caused the exhausted Black Nightmare to be unable to move. In fact, the Black Nightmare felt that it was quickly absorbing all of its life!</p>
 <p>“Well sealed!” Kang Ruodong said.</p>
 <p>Shen Nine Ghost’s Five Ghost Blood Diagram was a very famous seal throughout Wupan Continent. Having this technique, he could often make stronger opponents back off.</p>
 <p>Shen Nine Ghost humphed. With his Five Ghost Diagram, any strong organism would become blood and then be refined!</p>
 <p>Shen Nine Ghosts glanced at the Messiah Tree and noticed that the leader of the Feather Demons, Lu Nan, was near the girl!</p>
 <p>“Kang Ruodong, truly “good” moves- do you want Lu Nan to just run away with the girl?” Shen Nine Ghosts said angrily.</p>
 <p>With his words, Huo Lei and Xu Kuan noticed Lu Nan’s actions.</p>
 <p>“I’m just trying to save time.” Kang Ruodong explained.</p>
 <p>How could three of them believe Kang Ruodong. Without a second word, they both rode their soul pets towards the Messiah Tree.</p>
 <p>Ghost Blood Diagram continued for a long while. The Black Nightmare no longer posed a threat to them, so they had to discuss how to allocate the Messiah Tree seed now. After all, without it, there was no purpose in anything they were doing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Under the Messiah Tree, blood and feathers scattered near the roots. Three thousand wind eagle corpses were stacked up under Ning Maner. The thick scent of blood reached Ning Maner’s nose tip.</p>
 <p>This scent caused Ning Maner to be unable to breathe.</p>
 <p>The Feather Demons fell down from the skies, standing arrogantly on all the wind eagles.</p>
 <p>“Lady Ning, give the Messiah Tree seed to us, and the rest of these Wind Eagles don’t have to die. See, because of your greed, the entire Wind Eagle species had to die. Do you really think 4000 lives isn’t as meaningful as a small seed?” Lu Nan stood before Ning Maner and said in a fake but cruel tone.</p>
 <p>Ning Maner lowered her head, and stared hollowly at the corpses at her feet.</p>
 <p>If the Messiah Tree had seeds, Ning Maner would have given them to them long ago.</p>
 <p>Quiet Forest needed peace, and couldn’t bear these humans’ destruction anymore. The protectors needed to live on and couldn’t withstand these slaughterings!</p>
 <p>“I was speaking to you, did you hear me!” Lu Nan said angrily.</p>
 <p>He stepped forth and grabbed a fistful of her hair, saying cruelly, “If you don’t give it, I’ll kill you as well, don’t think the Ning Dynasty will still protect you!”</p>
 <p>Ning Maner was unmoving. She seemed to have no soul left, leaving only a husk behind.</p>
 <p>“Pa!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The angry Lu Nan slapped her.</p>
 <p>Ning Maner was unbelievably frail. After this slap hit her cheek, blood immediately leaked from the corner of her mouth.</p>
 <p>However, she still had no feeling, her eyes hollow as she stared at the corpses.</p>
 <p>She hadn’t lost her soul, but her brain was completely overtaken by the cruel scenes.</p>
 <p>The original Quiet Forest had become a barren land. Countless souls were killed no matter how they compromised or escaped. Even when the Messiah Tree was too kind to punish them, they hadn’t reflected upon their crime and instead got greedier and greedier. These people were the real devils!</p>
 <p>Ning Maner had no tears left to cry, but two lines of blood fell from her eyes, slowly dripping down her pale face.</p>
 <p>The blood tears seemed to have life, slowly spreading on her face, as if a blood colored plant were taking root…...</p>
 <p>Lu Nan’s mouth slightly twitched. This woman was ignoring him!</p>
 <p>Lu Nan lifted his hand with an even stronger slap to let her know her position.</p>
 <p>“Hu!”</p>
 <p>Lu Nan was just about to slap it when the hand he lifted was stiffened in mid air, no longer daring to fall!</p>
 <p>Lu Nan stared in fear to see a figure that had appeared!</p>
 <p>It was covered in black green clothes, filled with a chilling killing intent!</p>
 <p>Lu Nan looked at this man and cold sweat fell from his neck!</p>
 <p>The black green clothed man stepped towards Ning Maner. One could tell the man’s eyes were about to burst forth with anger!</p>
 <p>“He…...He….. He Cang!!” Lu Nan could barely say the name out loud!</p>
 <p>He Cang was already before Lu Nan. The black shadow at his feet had stealthily become a blade of darkness that represented He Cang’s inner fury!</p>
 <p>“Lu Nan! When you are reincarnated, you best remember that anyone I, He Cang, cares about, noone can even touch a hair of theirs, let alone slap them!” After he finished that, He Cang’s inner fury finally exploded forth!</p>
 <p>As if a volcano was exploding, He Cang’s roar lifted up the blade of darkness behind him with a storm of death!</p>
 <p>The blade fell with no sound but was just as dominating!!</p>
 <p>The darkness blade’s power fell. Lu Nan and his Feather Demon had no chance to make any defenses before being sliced up!</p>
 <p>The sharp blade flew through Lu Nan and the Feather Demon’s body, splitting both of them in half!</p>
 <p>Without any blood coming out, Lu Nan and his Feather Demon became a wisp of dark green smoke that dissipated with the wind!</p>
 <p>As their bodies vaporized, Lu Nan’s scared face seemed still frozen. However, his soul was already a step ahead into the underworld!</p>
 <p>The dark blade’s death storm rolled through. Lu Nan’s Feather Demons couldn’t live through it, becoming vapors in the dark blade storm, disappearing from this world.</p>
 <p>The dark green death smoke was He Cang’s signature kill. At the time when the Dark Sky Ocean Pirates were still powerful and rampant, He Cang used this mysterious dark organism under his feet to make them all dark green smokes of death, shocking all the cities along the coast of Wupan Continent!</p>
 <p>Dark Green He Cang, almost everyone on Wupan Continent knew him!</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong, Huo Lei, Xu Kuang, and Shen Nine Ghost had just come over, only to see Lu Nan and his Feather Demon instantly killed. This once again showed how powerful Dark Green He Cang was!</p>
 <p>“Come one at a time or come at once, you can choose!” He Cang stood on the Wind Eagles’ corpses and stared sharply at the four people.</p>
 <p>These four people all were relatively famous in Wupan Continent. Even if He Cang hadn’t seen them before, he could tell from their soul pets.</p>
 <p>“He Cang, we just want the seed, we of course wouldn’t touch Lady Ning. Lu Nan’s death was justified.” Shen Nine Ghosts was the first to let out a hoarse laugh.</p>
 <p>He Cang humphed. Anything Nine Ghosts said was meaningless and untrustworthy. If he hadn’t come in time, there was no telling what they would do to her.</p>
 <p>“Ugh~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>A cold glimmer arced through the sky, landing by the Messiah Tree.</p>
 <p>Blue feather, lion’s body, snake tail. When the organism landed, Kang Ruodong and the other soul pets all subconsciously moved aside!</p>
 <p>He Cang saw this python tail blue tiger and furrowed his brows, his face becoming more stern.</p>
 <p>He Cang earlier often walked through Guan City. After all, he came from Guan Territory’s Wan City. The person before him was nearly a hegemon in Guan Territory. Adding on his powerful navy, this person was definitely one of the top people in Guan Territory!</p>
 <p>“Wupan Navy Eighth Navy Commander, Xue Yingfeng!” He Cang coldly said the person’s name and position.</p>
 <p>Even Wupan Navy had people come for this, daring to come this far as well!</p>
 <p>“Boss He Cang, how are you doing?” Commander Xue Yingfeng was an acquaintance.</p>
 <p>However, Xue Yingfeng stood with the other four, already explaining his standpoint.</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong and the other three, He Cang could deal with - after all, they were all heavily wounded.</p>
 <p>However, it was much harder with Xue Yingfeng, who wasn’t any weaker than he was.</p>
 <p>“Huhuhuhu!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, on the barren land, the winds roared through and sand covered the skies.</p>
 <p>A whirlwind appeared in the skies. As it passed through, everything was destroyed!</p>
 <p>The wind flew towards them, the sand buffeting their faces.</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong, He Cang, Xue Yingfeng all looked at the whirlwind. It moved to the Messiah Tree and stopped, the wind quickly dissipating.</p>
 <p>As their vision slowly cleared, the six of them found two figures appearing from within. One was riding a wind type organism, while the other seemed to ride the wind over. He had no soul pets next to him but had a strange glow behind him.</p>
 <p>“Boss He Cang, how can you leave like this? Is our battle less important than a random woman?” The man with a glow behind him walked out and taunted He Cang.</p>
 <p>Without even looking, one could know that the one with a deep grudge against He Cang was the Master Official of Divine Sect - Xu Lu!</p>
 <p>If not for Xu Lu, He Cang would’ve arrived even sooner!</p>
