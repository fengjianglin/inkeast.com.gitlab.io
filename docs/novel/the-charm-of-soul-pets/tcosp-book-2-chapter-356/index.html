Get rid of those two ninth phase Terror Wolves as fast as you can!” said Chu Mu in one breath as he spoke to his two soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ninth phase low staged Terror Wolf wasn’t easy to kill. Chu Mu’s Heavenly Flame Rite managed to heavily wound it, but he knew that when they were heavily wounded, they could use Bloodthirsty Berserk Transformation and increase their fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, ultimately, he had to rely on Zhan Ye to kill the two low stage Terror Wolves. On the other hand, the Night Thunder Dream Beast could used the advantage it gained from evolving to the eighth phase to rigidly lock down the two low stage Terror Wolves, and use its speed to end this fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Night Thunder Dream Beast’s evolution changed the tides of the fight, and it made Chu Mu’s heart surge. Mo Xie had evolved to the eighth phase third stage, while the Night Thunder Dream Beast had reached the eighth phase first stage. This meant that Chu Mu possessed two eighth phase monarchs and his fighting strength had greatly increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, as long as he escaped from this vicious Terror Wolf territory, he would be able to get rid of the Wild Desert Scorpions after a period of rest. Perhaps he would be able to raise the levels of all his soul pets in one go, and have even more certainty when participating in the Battle of the Realm!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Chu Mu knew that things weren’t optimistic as they stood right now. Although these two low stage Terror Wolves were under control, Mo Xie’s fight against the middle stage Terror Wolf made Chu Mu very worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie had already exhibited her strongest fighting strength, but her strength ultimately still fell short of the ninth phase middle stage Terror Wolf. While Chu Mu managed the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s fight, Mo Xie’s body became covered with blood. However, only a small portion of it was the Terror Wolf’s blood, while a majority of it was her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie’s explosive strength was extremely powerful, and at the beginning of the fight, she could rely on her speed and experience to control the situation. However, as the fight persisted, the discrepancy in strength slowly manifested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo Xie, come to me.” Chu Mu put his attention on Mo Xie since, if things continued, Mo Xie would definitely be killed by the middle stage Terror Wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie used Nine Tail Confuse and, with great difficulty, managed to free herself from the Terror Wolf’s onslaught. She then rapidly ran to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That middle stage Terror Wolf also knew that it had to get rid of the Nine Tail Inferno Fox whose strength was the strongest in order to end the fight. After it saw that Mo Xie had freed herself from the fight, it revealed an ominous glint, and chased after Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the Terror Wolf’s charge, Chu Mu rapidly retreated and had Mo Xie meet it head on. While retreating, Chu Mu chanted another incantation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two soul techniques from before had already exhausted much of Chu Mu’s soul power so the soul technique now would be his last!</span></p>

It slowly transformed into a powerful storm upon which Chu Mu was on top of!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wind Dragon Bind!!</span></p>

The Wind Dragon Bind was clearly a wind type defense technique and could block a portion of wind power while also knocking enemies surrounding him flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no enemies next to Chu Mu, and the middle stage Terror Wolf was in the midst of fighting Mo Xie head on. Nonetheless, he used this technique for another purpose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu, on top of the Wind Dragon Bind, slowly swirled up into the sky as the Wind Dragon Bind continuously expanded. It engulfed the turbid particles in the air into itself before, under Chu Mu’s control, slowly dispersing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The night air of the desert wasn’t as turbid as the yellow ancient city, and a small wind technique was capable of clearing the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the night sky was clear, starlight fell unobstructed onto the earth. It made the earth seem no longer as muddy and dark.</span></p>

After the particles in the air were swept away by Chu Mu’s Wind Dragon Bind, a silver moonlight washed over this region, carrying with it a hazy illumination…&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver light enveloped Mo Xie, draping her bloody body in a soft moonlight armor that protected her body, while also healing the wounds on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moon Essence!! One of the greatest benefits of mutated soul pets were that they inherited all of the mutated soul pet species techniques. Thus, this seemingly insignificant ability from the Moonlight Fox state became an extremely crucial additional ability in Mo Xie’s current form!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In areas with moonlight, Mo Xie’s strength would greatly increase, and the eighth phase third stage Mo Xie would at least reach the eighth phase seventh stage level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was only an increase of four stages, in a situation where such a strength discrepancy existed with the Terror Wolf, the four stage increase was extremely pivotal because the discrepancy made her inferior to the middle stage Terror Wolf in terms of speed, attack, and defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Moon Essence’s effect could instantly allow Mo Xie’s speed to surpass the middle stage Terror Wolf and her attack would no longer be inferior to the Terror Wolf. As for her defense, she would be able to compensate with powerful dodging abilities and moreover, under the moonlight, her fighting strength would recover!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wu wu wu wu~~~~~~”</span></p>

This time, Mo Xie’s aura was not inferior to the ninth phase middle stage Terror Wolf; her two silver pupils also burned with a most demonic and most intense fighting flame!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Natural pride. Even if there was still a slight difference in strength, Mo Xie had a fighting lineage that would unceasingly grow stronger in her bones. There was no way she would lose at the hands of a Terror Wolf!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fighting spirit reignited, Mo Xie was no longer passive, and her fight with the Terror Wolf because a fierce battle where both sides unceasingly bled blood. It seemed like things would be decided by whoever lost all their blood first...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu stood aside from the fight, heavily breathing. Any soul technique would consume an abnormal amount of soul power, and Chu Mu had consecutively used three of them. Further adding on the soul power consumption from before, he was nearly completely exhausted of soul power and right now could only rely on his three soul pets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the three soul pets in this fight had stimulated their highest potential in their bodies. Mo Xie had begun the fight at the eighth phase third stage against a ninth phase middle stage Terror Wolf and if it was before, she probably wouldn’t have even lasted 5 minutes before being riddled with injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, under desperate straights, Mo Xie’s potential would always burst forth, narrowly allowing Chu Mu to avert disaster. This time was no exception.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Night Thunder Dream beast, its evolution was also extremely crucial. It had only been at the seventh phase ninth stage at the beginning, and had stayed there for three to four months. Chu Mu had really hoped that it would be the first soul pet to reach the eighth phase, but the eighth phase bottleneck truly was not easy to cross.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t until this bought of seven continuous days of fighting those stronger than it that the Night Thunder Dream Beast was able to release the anger from being unable to break through the bottleneck. It was finally able to break through with its fighting and perseverance while also saving Chu Mu a great amount of gold!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

This was especially the case the later the fight went, because Zhan Ye’s fighting intent would become stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
