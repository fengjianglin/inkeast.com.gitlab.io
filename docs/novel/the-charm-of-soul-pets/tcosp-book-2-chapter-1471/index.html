 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The different rescue teams were slowly gathering together from the different parts of the city. However, such large movement would easily attract an enormous population of iceberg monsters too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the three thousand refugees regrouped, over ten thousand iceberg monsters had appeared in front of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A densely packed white monster tide could be seen approaching them in a glance. Their sharp claws dug deep into the frozen ground. Those solid-looking ice rocks were easily getting crushed by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chaotic roars were echoing unceasingly. The terrifying noise greatly shook those weak refugees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the most horrifying matter was not the monsters who were appearing in front of them. It was the large waves of monsters who were constantly approaching their direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white iceberg monsters were advancing like a tsunami and were swallowing everything along the way. They had gradually approached from the outskirts of Ice City towards the outer city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the second wave of monsters rushed into the city, the refugees in the outer and middle city would definitely not be able to survive any longer. Chu Mu had to transfer these three thousand refugees into the inner city as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the sun began to set, the remnant glow started spreading over the city that was full of ice shards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stood silently on a wobbling ice lighthouse by himself and overlooked the countless iceberg monsters that were rushing about within the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu turned back to take a glance at the three thousand refugees who were gradually making their way to him and slowly closed his eyes as he started chanting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incantation was really long. Once he reopened his eyes, black and silver flames were burning in his left and right pupils respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Devil Fire shot out from his palms and was accurately thrown by Chu Mu into the monster-infested city before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two clusters of flames with distinct colors flew high above the city and transformed into a trigram in midair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was half black and half silver. This Devil Fire Trigram was so huge that it easily covered the entire sky above the city. It looked as if dark clouds were looming over the city if people were to look at it from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Fire Trigram began spinning rapidly. A destructive force that could annihilate the space along with the Devil Fire manifested from within the shrouded area. Next, a scene that astonished those three thousand refugees lay before them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The countless iceberg monsters in front of them were instantly crushed into smithereens under the Devil Fire Trigram. It was as if something fragile made from sand was easily blown apart by a raging gale!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how could those iceberg monsters have been made of sand? They possessed robust physiques and a frost armor, as well as sharp claws......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white powder danced madly in the air just like a sandstorm. The refugees were unable to accept the reality that was happening before them and stood still utterly dumbfounded. Even those Spirit Dominators could not have imagined that Chu Mu could instantly annihilate dozens of thousands of iceberg monsters with a single move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t stop, continue walking!” Chu Mu reminded those Spirit Dominators loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three thousand refugees snapped back to their senses after a long while and hurriedly followed after Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With dozens of thousands of iceberg monsters instantly annihilated, there would be no significant danger to them in the following journey. However, those who had witnessed that scene would never be able to forget it for the rest of their lives!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner city was getting closer and closer. Chu Mu used his overwhelming strength to escort these three thousand refugees to the inner city safely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many iceberg bird monsters in the viscinity of the inner city. Chu Mu called Ghost King over to escort these refugees into the city safely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the refugees realized that this mountain-like giant was also Chu Mu’s soul pet, the refugees became even more respectful towards Chu Mu. After all, they could never have imagined that someone could stop millions of iceberg monsters all alone before Chu Mu arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking in the three thousand refugees, City Lord Bing Li immediately arranged for a place for them to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those refugees had been trapped outside for around ten days. They were hungry, fatigued, scared and tormented. Now that they were finally rescued, they required a really good rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many amongst those refugees could not even believe that they had really survived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Wan and the youth did not walk far. They noticed that before they had arrived, there were already quite a few batches of refugees in the city. The headcount was roughly numbered at about ten thousand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Wan knew that there were definitely far more than ten thousand people who were unable to escape in time. However, being able to rescue ten thousand people in such a situation could already be considered an impossible feat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander, thank you very much. I had thought that I would have met my end this time......” Zhuo Wan bent her body and did a formal greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth was nervous and did not know just how to express his gratitude. He could only stand quietly next to Zhuo Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only those who had a near-death experience could truly appreciate the preciousness of life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take a rest,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander, I have a small request......” whispered Zhuo Wan after she took a glance at the youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What request?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Wan walked next to Chu Mu and told him in a low volume, “His parents passed away in this disaster and now he has no place to go anymore. He is a strong-willed person and a talented soul pet trainer. I hope that Commander can keep him. He really admires and respects you, if you can take him in as your disciple......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s his name?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Jun,” answered Zhuo Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t take in disciples, but I can bring him to Wanxiang City. Holy Guard Chief Zhuo Nong should be interested,” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Guard was currently acknowledged as the strongest army of New Moon Land. Many young soul pet trainers set becoming a New Moon Land Holy Guard as their targets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being able to enter the Holy Guard trainee troop was similar to becoming a Holy Guard reserve. This was a huge leap in quality for a youth who had just become a soul pet trainer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Commander...... Oh, it should be King Chu now!” Zhuo Wan’s pale face revealed a charming smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Someone who can still laugh with a bloodied face is either a lunatic or a genius,” Chu Mu was rather interested in the mental state of this youth. Hopefully, he could grow up to become an expert in the new generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Wan did not dare to bother Chu Mu any longer. She knew that Chu Mu surely had many more things to do with his current position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Jun was dumbfounded once again by this mind blowing news. New Moon Land’s holy Guard. In the past, he had always felt that getting into the city guard force would be impressive. He did not even dare to imagine getting into Snow City’s main force. He had never expected that he would be able to enter the Holy Guard army!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could get into the Holy Guard trainee group, then as long as he worked hard, he would be able to become a proud New Moon Land Holy Guard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must be tired,” Mu Qingyi strolled over and casually passed a few Ice Snow Fruits to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Will the inner city defenses be breached?” Chu Mu threw the thirst quenching fruits into his mouth and gulped them down immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So crude,” Mu Qingyi rolled her eyes after she saw Chu Mu’s actions. This Ice Snow Fruit was a specialty of Ice City. It was hard to come by, yet Chu Mu had swallowed it just like simple candy. What a waste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s secure, those monsters cannot breach the defenses for the moment. However, just defending passively like this won’t do. We cannot just migrate with hundreds of thousands of people,” said Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You stay in the city, I will go into the ice mountains and check out just which monster has caused this monster flood,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All disasters had a root cause. Chu Mu would naturally go and pull it out from the root!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re going now?” asked Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, things will only get worse if we drag it out any longer,” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should go tomorrow. You have been running around the entire middle to the outer city today and did not get any time to rest at all,” Mu Qingyi expressed her concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine,” Chu Mu still felt fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi stared into Chu Mu’s eyes quietly for quite a while before smiling, “Look at you, acting so cold-blooded and aloof, yet you’re doing your best just to save them. In that case, just why did you threaten that city lord and her soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Mu Qingyi was defending the city, she had been focused on Chu Mu the entire time. She could see that Chu Mu was rushing continuously in the city for the entire day and did not rest for even a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing ten thousand people was just a matter of a single technique at Chu Mu’s level. However, on the other hand, saving ten thousand people required him to keep running around the city for the entire day. The difference between the two was huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu raised his brow and spoke, “I just went to tell them that I will save those whom I can save. Also, I’m wondering just why the news didn’t reach me since it should have been an urgent letter. I have already reminded my subordinates to pay close attention to the news related to Snow City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps the problem lies in one of the command chains. After all, an urgent letter has to go through a few people before it reaches you,” said Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu made a note of this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That wave of monster will be reaching here pretty soon. I will leave Ghost King and Devil Tree here to assist you with the defense,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, go ahead. I will protect them. Oh, City Lord Bing Li has also found her brother. She wants to express her gratitude to you personally, but is afraid that you may feel offended by her previous actions. So, she wants me to express her gratitude to you in her place,” said Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not offended by her though. Just that I didn’t like the words that were said by her subordinates. I’m not a generous person after all,” replied Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s true. Such a beautiful and pure girl is begging you like that, so how can you bear to get angry at her?” said Mu Qingyi with a sarcastic tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I look like that kind of person?” Chu Mu smiled bitterly. For some reason, in the way that Mu Qingyi had phrased it, it made him seem like a person who got soft on beautiful women. Chu Mu had never really seen the face of that city lord clearly before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not really, I hope you are though,” said Mu Qingyi gloomily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu pretended not to comprehend it. He jumped onto Night’s back and departed towards the ice mountains.</span></p>
