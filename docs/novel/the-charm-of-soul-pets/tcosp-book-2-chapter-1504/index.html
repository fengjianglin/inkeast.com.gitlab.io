 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Female Supreme Liu, this old friend of mine is cultivating and we shouldn’t disturb him. Let’s come again next time.” Uncle Yu walked out of the room and spoke to Liu Binglan who was waiting next to the spring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, then let’s return.” Liu Binglan nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On their way back, they passed by the main peak manor. Liu Binglan found that there were many people there. She didn’t recognize most of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t want to speak with these people, so she walked alone back to the linking peak’s manor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you New Moon Land’s Female Supreme Liu Binglan?” a Border Lord ostensibly recognized her and spoke up with a faint smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Border Lord spoke a bit loudly. Everyone in the corridor could hear him and many people looked over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the group was a red-haired, mature lady, wearing a fiery red robe. She walked in front of Liu Binglan and put on an amicable looking smile as she said: “I’ve long heard that New Moon Land’s Female Supreme Liu was an icy beauty. Everyone calls me Madam Huo. I am Elemental Sect’s Fire Faction Lord. I’m very happy to be able to meet you here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan examined the woman exuding a slightly fiery aura. She maintained her calm and politeness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The previous matters were negotiated by my subordinates and your people. Perhaps they may have offended you somewhere. I hope that Female Supreme Liu doesn’t take offense. Fortunately, we were able to meet here. We may as well sit down and discuss your Nightmare Holy Realm’s matters. How about that?” Madam Huo did an inviting gesture.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it was a faction lord from Elemental Sect, it was difficult for Liu Binglan to refuse. Thus, she followed her to the pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Elemental Sect Fire Faction’s members wish to cultivate in our Nightmare Holy Region, our New Moon Land won’t refuse. However, if you want to obtain control rights over Nightmare Holy Region, that is impossible.” Liu Binglan was very frank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elemental Sect Fire Faction had previously sent people to discuss Nightmare Holy Region with Liu Binglan. The Fire Faction wanted the Nightmares to become their soul pets and replace Nightmare Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although NIghtmare Palace was perhaps insignificant compared to Elemental Sect Fire Faction, it was extremely important to New Moon Land. How could Liu Binglan agree to Elemental Sect’s domineering buying out of Nightmare Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Female Supreme Liu, we must negotiate a transaction. There’s no need to shoot down an idea so quickly. Perhaps the conditions we give you will make you satisfied.” Madam Huo said with a faint smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people considered the great holy realms as equal. However, in reality, Nightmare Holy Region was currently New Moon Land’s true core.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, Nightmare Holy Region’s Nightmare species was under the control of Chu Mu’s subordinate, the Nightmare Ruler. As the Holy Regions continuously expanded, the current Nightmare subordinates of the Nightmare Ruler were enough to constitute a dynasty!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Liu Binglan agreed to let Elemental Sect’s people fully administer Nightmare Holy Region, the Nightmare species inside wouldn’t agree.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, besides the Nightmare species in Nightmare Holy Region, there was also a foreign species there - the Devil Souls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Soul species viewed Princess Jinrou as their queen. Although this species reproduced very slowly, it was growing increasingly prosperous. Moreover, every once in a while, the Devil Soul species would let a few outstanding members sign soul pacts with outstanding young people from New Moon Land. This would help New Moon Land’s internal members break through the species rank restriction. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Souls’ help was imperative for the rise of talents in New Moon Land these recent years. Thus, giving Nightmare Holy Region to Elemental Sect was equivalent to giving the Devil Soul species to them. How could the value of the Devil Soul species be measured using spirit items, territory or soul pets?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s place the Nightmare Holy Region matter aside for now. Our Wind Faction’s faction lord is probably very interested in your Binding Wind Holy Region. You probably have also negotiated with Divine Sect’s members about Palm Dawn Holy Region, right?” said Madam Huo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The holy regions are the foundations of New Moon Land. Their control rights will not be given or exchanged to you.” Liu Binglan maintained her firm stance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then how about if New Moon Land didn’t exist?” Madam Huo rubbed her fingernail and calmly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan faintly creased her brows. It seemed that Madam Huo was threatening her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Apparently we have nothing to talk about. I’ll leave first.” Liu Binglan stood up and didn’t bother with Madam Huo any further.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your New Moon Land has only entered Zhengming Continent for a short while. You really don’t understand the rules. There are some things that you must give up to us on your own accord. Perhaps this will allow you to avoid many things. I didn’t realize you didn’t understand the meaning of “treasuring a jade ring will attract trouble”. New Moon Land has stayed a small place for a long time and probably is ignorant. However, there’s someone warning you about this out of the good of her heart. I hope you understand what to do and you don’t just sit there on your high horse. In New Moon Land you may be the mighty Female Supreme, but in Zhengming Continent you are nothing.” Madam Huo watched Liu Binglan aloofly leave and her tone turned cold. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she heard this, Uncle Yu, who was following Liu Binglan creased his brows. He turned around and stared at the rude Madam Huo. In a cold voice he said: “And who are you to say that? Has Elemental Sect degraded to such a state that a tiny fire type faction lord can speak for them?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems that the master has considered everyone else beneath them to the point where an old servant like you can wantonly take action. Since when was an old rotten man like you able to speak for someone here?” harshly rebuked Madam Huo. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Uncle Yu heard Madam Huo’s words, he grew even angrier!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had crushed their Elemental Sect’s experts, Madam Huo hadn’t even been born yet. The people of these times were growing increasingly arrogant, and they didn’t understand what was meant by respecting one’s elders!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Yu, forget it.” Liu Binglan shook her head. She didn’t let Uncle Yu meaninglessly argue with Madam Huo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Uncle Yu wanted to explode in anger, but when he saw Liu Binglan’s calm eyes, his anger was quickly suppressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the courtyard, the moment they entered the corridor, a few people immediately went up to greet Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My name is Wang Kuan. I am a Gate Master from Demon Beast Palace Beast Gate.” said a man with a scar on his face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am Ruan Lei, Du Border’s Border Lord. Female Supreme Liu, we have probably seen each other a few times before.” said the man wearing a large yellow robe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other woman didn’t introduce herself. She merely sized up Liu Binglan with her arrogant eyes. The corners of her mouth were faintly curling up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t know what these border lords or gate masters were here for. Thus, she calmly looked back at them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our Northern Territory’s subsidiary faction has already taken form there. Isn’t the tax there a bit too high? How about Female Supreme Liu hand over the rights to Northern Territory to us. Name your conditions,” said the man called Wang Kuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can we talk about this later?” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That won’t do. Since we’re able to meet here, it’s better for both of us if we deal with this matter quickly.” said Wang Kuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you want to talk, then send people to New Moon Land. You’re blocking Female Supreme’s path. Are you trying to force her to do something?” Uncle Yu could see that these three people were finding trouble so he spoke up without any courtesy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old uncle, how are we forcing her to do anything? We only want to discuss a pressing matter with Female Supreme Liu. If Female Supreme Liu feels that it’s beneath her to talk with us, we will naturally let her go,” said the unknown woman somewhat scaldingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan creased her brows again. These people really were targeting her and New Moon Land. They clearly wanted to occupy New Moon Land’s enormously profitable resources!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan couldn’t let them do that. However, these three people were obviously instigating things, and were intentionally pushing New Moon Land into an even further isolated place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Land was a newly independent territory and its rise had only occurred over the past few years. The people who were able to participate in this conference were basically around the gate master rank. If New Moon Land were to put on airs in a place like this, that would be tantamount to suicide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Liu Binglan was stuck, not knowing what to do, a man wearing snow white clothing walked over from a side corridor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Excuse me, I have something private to discuss with Female Supreme Liu.” the white-clothed man coldly swept his eyes over those three people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Kuan and that woman were acting brash and harsh, but when they saw this man, they hastily swallowed their words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them no longer dared hold up Liu Binglan and quickly gave way to them!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white-clothed man gave an inviting gesture and brought Liu BInglan out of the courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Kuan, Ruan Lei and the woman were in shock for a long time as they stared at the white-clothed man’s back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why… why is Magistrate Xiao here?” said Wang Kuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect’s white clothing meant it was Chief Magistrate Xiao Xueang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who in the entirety of Zhengming Continent dared block Xiao Xueang’s path?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Kuan and Ruan Lei didn’t understand why the insignificant New Moon Land Female Supreme Liu knew Xiao Xueang and even was going to have a private discussion with him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they reached the linking peak manor, Liu Binglan glanced at the adjacent Divine Sect magistrate. She faintly revealed a courteous smile as she said: “What is it that Magistrate Xiao would like to discuss… or perhaps you’re helping me get out of trouble?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang said: “I was passing by and saw you, so I came by and conveniently helped you out of trouble. Also, there are a few people in Divine Sect targeting you and New Moon Land. Those people don’t belong under the scope of my control. I came by to tell you this. I hope that you don’t mistake it as me ordering them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Liu Binglan nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had seen Magistrate Xiao a few times before. She happened to see him, coincidentally, the last time she was in Zhengming Main City’s Territory Institution.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had thus thought he was a Territory Institution member, because the few times she saw him were there and they had had a few simple conversations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t until later when she was with Ye Qingzi once that she realized that this man who had talked with her a few times was Divine Sect’s greatly renowned Chief Magistrate Xiao Xueang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are a few things I must attend to. Then… then I will say goodbye first.” Xiao Xueang brought Liu Binglan to the entrance of the linking peak manor and then left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Uncle Yu was next to them the whole time but didn’t say anything. It wasn’t until Xiao Xueang left before he finally laughed and said: “This Magistrate Xiao always uses the words passing by, conveniently, and coincidence…”&nbsp;</span></p>
