 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the City Lord and the generals left, Mu Qingyi glanced at the stern Chu Mu. She softly asked: “Are you angry?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just now, Chu Mu had been slightly scary. At least to people who had never met Chu Mu before, he only needed to have a slightly imposing tone, and their minds wouldn’t be able to bear it. Indeed, the soul remembrance of a spirit immortal rank was too strong compared to these normal soul pet trainers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No.” Chu Mu shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu couldn’t be bothered to get mad at them. He was mad at the fact that they thought they were entitled to criticize his and Ye Qingzi’s wedding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Chu Mu’s eyes, even if all of New Moon Land’s people died, as long as this didn’t include the people he cared about, he would still hold a wedding on a river of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the beginning, Chu Mu had a clear identity. He was a cultivator. He became the king because other people viewed him as such. He was willing to protect New Moon Land because the people he cared about were willing to protect New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never considered himself a savior. In fact, he carried a killing aura even heavier than some evil people. If New Moon Land’s people wanted to view him as a kind king, they were bound to be disappointed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I almost thought you weren’t going to save the people here, even after seeing them in danger.” said Mu Qingyi as she continued, “Speaking of which, even if you don’t think that saving them is your job, don’t say that. You’re the king after all and such words will hurt people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi knew that a king didn’t need to apologize.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m a very genuine person, and people should understand my style,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really are a strange person.” Mu Qingyi had a kind heart, but wouldn’t demand Chu Mu to have one too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m an eccentric.” corrected Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Try and save those people trapped in the outer and inner city as best as you can. Consider it as helping me. Didn’t you say that you only care about saving those who you care about? Then am I part of this group of people?” Mu Qingyi glanced at Chu Mu and asked the question in a very serious and proper manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure,” once again, Chu Mu remembered the sudden kiss by Mu Qingyi. His eyes couldn’t help but flicker towards Mu Qingyi’s moist lips. He felt weak in his heart and quickly averted his gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes means yes, and no means no. Then what is “sure”?” Mu Qingyi didn’t let him get away with that answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. What was up with Mu Qingyi today? In the past, she would avoid these questions. Why was she being so direct, recently?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was a married man, and didn’t know how to respond when being questioned by a woman about ambiguous feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, oh, they’ve come. I’m going to save people.” Chu Mu decisively changed the topic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi pouted her lips. Both elegantly and coldly she said: “And you said you were a genuine person?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu acted as if he didn’t hear her, and flew from the city tower to the wide city wall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bing Li brought a total of 30 people, not 40 which she had said. These people looked tired. The defensive fight had probably exhausted much of their strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these dominator rank experts saw Chu Mu, their exhausted eyes immediately lit up and they respectfully gave a simple bow to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu, that Ghost King is your soul pet, right?” said a young spirit dominator who looked about the same age as Chu Mu. It was possible to sense the respect and reverence he had towards Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost King stood high and mightily. Its aura was able to suppress the ice mountain monsters until they couldn’t move forwards. It was as if a single soul pet was capable of protecting a city. There was nobody who wouldn’t envy such strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With it here, the city will definitely be safe.” said another spirit dominator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re going to battle the Ice Mountain Monster Army. There will be danger. Everyone prepare yourself.” Chu Mu said to the dominator rank experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With King Chu leading the way, what do we have to be afraid of?!” said the young soul pet trainer that spoke first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. We’re not afraid. No matter what comes, we won’t be afraid.” the others showed no expression of fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most people who were able to reach the dominator rank had gone through many tempering experiences of life and death. Perhaps saving people from a monster pack was a method of training to help them breakthrough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“City Lord Bing Li, stay here in the city, and help Mu Qingyi defend the city.” Chu Mu glanced at City Lord Bing Li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bing Li wanted to go out and save people because her younger brother was trapped in the middle city. However, since King Chu didn’t want her to go, she obviously wouldn’t leave without his permission. Currently, the inner city was overpopulated and people were feeling uneasy. As the city lord, there were many things she had to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Defending the city and charging into the monster pack to save people were two completely different things. Defending the city required, at least, a barrier, a fortress, a city wall and multiple defensive measures like plants when clashing with ice mountain monsters. Unless the defenses were broken through, the casualties wouldn’t be excessive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, saving people from groups of monsters was an extremely risky task because every person would be surrounded by countless ice mountain monsters. WIthout absolute strength, it would be impossible to brashly charge in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also why Chu Mu only chose the dominator rank experts for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the city wall, thirty four dominator rank experts followed Chu Mu into the chaotic middle city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle city was nearly reduced to ruins. Occasionally, a few buildings would teeter as Ice Mountain Monsters would climb on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, countless Ice Mountain Birds circled around, letting out unpleasant shouts that were ear-piercing and sharp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s split up and move. Each of you choose a certain number of people to save according to your strength. Once you reach your limit, it doesn’t matter how many people are trapped in the same place, you must return to the inner city and send those people back to a safe place first.” Chu Mu instructed everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saving people was harder than killing people, because after every dominator rank expert saved someone, they would have to take these people who weren’t that strong through the ruined middle city where Ice Mountain Monsters roamed. They would have to avoid the huge wave of ice mountain monsters attempting to attack the inner city and return to the inner city themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people who weren’t strong would ultimately be a burden and may accidentally drag the dominator experts down. Therefore, among the 40 dominator experts, it was imaginable that there were some people who didn’t dare attempt such a dangerous task.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The moment any of you are surrounded, immediately send a signal to me. I will get there as soon as possible.” Chu Mu continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone nodded their heads. With a powerful immortal rank expert like Chu Mu acting as a safeguard, they would have more confidence going to save these people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The 30 dominator rank experts split up and moved. They rode on their soul pet trainers and nimbly sped through the ruined city. Using their perception, they searched for the survivors hiding.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many corpses in the middle city. The remnants of the streets and houses were filled with flowing blood on the icy ground. It dyed the white-colored icy city into a gaudy red color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of the ice mountain monsters roaming the middle city were using their noses to continuously smell the area. They were ostensibly aware that this enormous city was hiding many humans. In their eyes, these humans were but mere puny and tasty rabbits. They only needed to find them and they would have a tasty meal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every once in a while, from some corner of the city, miserable cries would ring out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, some person who wasn’t hiding well enough was discovered and had become prey for these Ice Mountain Monsters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every time the other people hiding in the ruins heard the miserable cries, they would feel their hairs rise because they didn’t know when such a tragedy would befall upon them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They knew that they would die, but they didn’t have the courage to end their own lives. Yet, who was willing to have their precious body ripped apart by the monsters’ claws and then bitten into…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Zhuo Wan, I saw the man riding the black Dream Beast again.” said the weak young man with excitement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s definitely an expert sent from Wanxiang City to help!” Zhuo Wan’s eyes lit up and she felt much more relieved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What does it matter if help comes. They will only be able to protect the inner city. Us people will definitely die. Nobody will come save us. Even if an elemental army comes from Wanxiang City, they may use their elemental destruction to destroy the enemies as fast as possible; some of that may land on us and eradicate us along with the monsters.” said a trapped middle-aged man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the middle-aged man finished speaking, the young man’s eyes dimmed. He looked at the adjacent wounded and exhausted Zhuo Wan as he softly said: “Big Sister Zhuo Wan, is that right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Wan remained silent. She couldn’t refute this possibility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sending more people to save these scattered citizens would only lead to more deaths. Unless the ice mountain monsters retreated first, even if help came, a single explosion capable of hitting them would annihilate them along with these ice mountain monsters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man saw that Zhuo Wan wasn’t saying anything and was able to guess as much. For a while, he stopped peering outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gloomily sat against the wall that was full of ashe. He looked at the many wounded people next to him. For a moment, the destroyed cave of people were silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder who the man riding on the black Dream Beast is. He’s able to ride through the million Ice Mountain Monsters as he pleases.” muttered the young man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Riding in between the monster pack?” Zhuo Wan was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not riding in between. He’s simply walking in the air. For some reason, no matter the Ice Mountain Monster on the ground or Ice Mountain Bird in the sky, none of them dare approach him.” said the young man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, how is that possible? There are a million Ice Mountain Monsters and even their spit is able to drown people to death. How can they not attack the person you’re speaking of?” said the middle-aged man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it’s the truth! Those monsters don’t dare attack him! I saw him pass right through!” the young man was unhappy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had personally witnessed it. Could he have been wrong?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can such a powerful person exist in this world? You’re definitely hallucinating.” said the middle-aged man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t believe me, you can go look. If I tricked you, I’ll go out right now and feed myself to these monsters!” said the young man somewhat angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This middle-aged man was always so pessimistic, making everyone feel as if there was no hope of surviving. Obviously, this young man was unhappy.&nbsp;</span></p>
