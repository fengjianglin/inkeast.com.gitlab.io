 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Devil flames were ignited. Regardless of how powerful the black hole’s suction force was, it was impossible to cause the devil flames to flicker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his body gradually transformed into a devil, Chu Mu turned around. Despite knowing that this was such a powerful enemy, Chu Mu still had to land a blow on the Chieftain’s domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chieftain was behind them, and he wasn’t in a good mood because he never expected that he would let Darkness Sect’s Heaven Slaughter flee once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since he sat on the Chieftain’s seat, there had never been a person who managed to escape his grasps twice!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, it’s also fine if I can obtain the Monument Tear.” the Chieftain glanced at Chu Mu who no longer had a path to flee and consoled himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Chieftain had noticed the strange transformation occurring on Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imprint Valley’s broken restriction even created a positive effect for Chu Mu. His current devil transformation was like a butterfly breaking out from a pupa. It required the energy-restricted by the pupa to be opened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched the terrifying Chieftain grow closer and closer, Chu Mu grew a bit nervous. The devil flames covering his body began to unceasingly pour outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a strange element appeared around Chu Mu. Immediately after, his surroundings suddenly warped in the chaotic space!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu transformed into a half devil, he was full of perception of the other type element.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the chaotic space around him that was mysteriously warping was actually an other type elemental Strange Warp. Chu Mu’s Displacement Specter originated from this kind of other type elemental Strange Warp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he hadn’t chanted anything; why was the other type element around him warping? Where was it going to take him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zi~~~~”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without giving Chu Mu too much time to think, the space Chu Mu, Princess Jinrou, and the Martial Cloud Dragon were in suddenly warped!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them mysteriously disappeared from where they were as they were forcibly transferred by some spatial force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene before their eyes went blank. It seemed both like a long amount of time, but also like the blink of an eye before their vision returned to normal. The only difference was that Chu Mu was no longer in a spatial windstorm. Instead, he was now mysteriously standing int he safe area where Young Lady Si was!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spatial Exchange!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had been forcibly spatially exchanged to a safe location!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying spatial windstorm was growing increasingly big. Through the chaotic energy, Chu Mu could see that the cold and large figure originally standing in front of him was now in the spatial windstorm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was Heaven Slaughter!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was currently standing where Heaven Slaughter just was - right in front of the safe location. On the other hand, Heaven Slaughter’s location was now in the death zone where he just was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. He looked inconceivably at the masked man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had used his Strange Mane Demon to Spatial Exchange. He had saved Chu Mu, but thrown himself into a realm of inevitable death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why? Why did he do it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a stranger, and someone who probably was an enemy. Why would he use his own life to save him? Chu Mu was in deep bewilderment and shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial windstorm grew stronger and stronger, sweeping Heaven Slaughter’s body up. However, the terrifying Navy Chieftain was growing closer, and he no longer had anywhere to flee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed to know that he was going to die as Heaven Slaughter, struggling in the windstorm, looked over at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter’s black pupils had never had any trace of movement or emotions in them during the entire time Chu Mu had seen him. Only now did his eyes move and it seemed to express everything he had hidden in his heart…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could clearly see his eyes. He was unable to understand the meaning contained in his eyes, but the gaze looked extremely familiar to something he recently saw.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw those eyes when the Devil Wolf father had saved the infant wolf as it was falling into the bottomless abyss...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heaven had fallen and earth had collapsed. It was both silent, yet noisy. This world was going to be destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he stood on the edge of the collapsing cliff, Chu Mu blankly looked at the man. His throat seemed to be blocked by something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun was shining bright. Although spatial vibrations didn’t stop transmitting from another dimension, the place he currently stood upon was calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s gaze was at a loss as he looked at the beautiful mountains in front of him. His head was filled with dark heaven and sky scenes from Imprint Valley, as well as that final gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why… why did he save you?!” Young Lady Si angrily grabbed onto Chu Mu’s collar as she yelled at himm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Lady Si had already thrown off her veil, revealing an astoundingly beautiful face. She fiercely gripped Chu Mu. In her opinion, Chu Mu had basically killed Heaven Slaughter because the latter had used Spatial Exchange to throw himself into the death zone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t resist. From the moment he escaped through the spatial passage from the collapsing Imprint Valley, he looked like he had lost his soul. His eyes didn’t contain a trace of vigor in them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou looked at Chu Mu’s soulless appearance. It was the same expression Chu Mu had when he found out Night had died. However, this time, it was even more apparent. His black eyes were no longer focusing, and he looked like an empty, walking corpse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou didn’t understand why Heaven Slaughter had saved them, nor why Chu Mu was suddenly like this. Was Darkness Sect’s Heaven Slaughter a very important person to him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me!!!” Young Lady Si yelled at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Lady Si’s voice made Chu Mu come back to his senses. He glanced at Young Lady Si and slowly said: “He’s my father.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Lady Si was stunned and she looked blankly at Chu Mu and his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was able to see a resemblance of Chu Mu’s face with Heaven Slaughter’s. If Chu Mu hadn’t said anything, she wouldn’t have paid attention. But when she carefully looked, she shockingly discovered that the two of them really had resemblance!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Princess Jinrou heard Chu Mu’s words, she fell into shock, and it was a while before she came back to her senses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou was about to say something to console Chu Mu when she suddenly detected something. She examined her surroundings with a bit of panic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, there’s a group of people coming. They seem to be coming for us,” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked around him. Indeed, he found a few people in between the mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the Navy Chieftain knew of another exit, he probably had sent people to defend this place just in case.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As these people grew closer and closer, the leader of them looked familiar. When he flew in front of the three of them, Chu Mu was finally able to clearly see his face. He was the Fake Monument Tear Individual Gu Xisha!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Xisha had a malevolent face, and a pair of greedy eyes that resembled a wolf. His group of subordinates were all riding on fierce beasts and they numbered over 50. In an instant, they surrounded Chu Mu’s group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tch, we finally meet again. It seems that my guess before was right. You really are a Monument Tear Individual.” Gu Xisha looked at Chu Mu with a big smile. He looked extremely pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked at Gu Xisha, then at his 50 subordinates.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half of them were Xuan Gate people and the other half were Wupan Navy people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This person should be the renowned Young Lady Si, right?” Hehe, since I can’t see your Darkness Sect’s Heaven Slaughter, I presume he’s died at the hands of our Great Chieftain, right?” laughed Gu Xisha.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was you who had the Chieftain kill him!” Young Lady Si spoke with abnormal amounts of anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So what if that’s true?” Gu Xisha had an arrogant expression. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Lady Xi clenched her fists and her arms faintly trembled. It was possible to see how mad she currently was!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Young Lady Si wasn’t the only person who was clenching her fists. There was also Chu Mu who stood by the side and was extremely miserable. Furthermore, nobody noticed that his body was currently split into two different colors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His right side was an evil and demonic silver color, while the left side was a wild and devastating black color. The two devil flames were distinctly split, like two evil devils standing with their backs to each other!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was in a horrible state of mind. He had longed for the day he saw his father. And when he finally did, it was the last time he did so. The heart-wrenching pain put him in a nearly mad state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a person’s emotions reached their peak, they always had to vent it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place wasn’t Imprint Valley. There were no restrictions. What he wanted the most was to kill!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu…” Princess Jinrou could understand Chu Mu’s current state of mind. However, when she saw Chu Mu show two devil sides, her eyes were full of shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An enormous killing intent transformed into a storm, accompanied by a low pressure and whirling black cloud layer that instantly covered the beautiful mountain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bone-chilling cold arrived and a savage devil flame swept through. It mirrored the dividing line under Chu Mu’s feet. Half of the earth was covered by a silver color, while the other half was a black color that extended to the horizon!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dual devil person!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s pupils had completely changed. Right now, everyone, including Gu Xisha, felt an unknown fear. This fear made their souls incessantly tremble. This was a horrifying devil that they didn’t dare even look directly at!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What… what… what kind of monster are you!” when Gu Xisha looked at Chu Mu’s devil transformation, his face was full of shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Xisha had never encountered such a powerful creature aside from the enormous pressure he felt from the Chieftain. Chu Mu’s power didn’t come from an incomparable aura; instead, it was an unprecedented evil, bloodthirstiness, and madness. It made one feel as if the evilest creature in the world was here!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone had transformed into a devil, causing violent anger to become torrential devil flames that filled the sky and earth!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place wasn’t Imprint Valley. There was no powerful restriction. Who would be able to stop Chu Mu?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had followed the path his father had personally guided him on. He had continued walking forwards and even if the path was bumpy, he never stopped. Nobody could understand the position Chu Tianmang occupied in Chu Mu’s heart; therefore, nobody could understand Chu Mu’s current state of mind!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the only thing in Chu Mu’s eyes was slaughter!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any enemy he saw had to die!!&nbsp;</span></p>
