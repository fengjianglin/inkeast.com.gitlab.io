 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luan City was a dazzling and shimmering city. It produced a certain special crystal stone in abundance. This stone didn’t have any particular ability, but it was a great ornament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Practically every building was embedded with these beautiful crystal stones. People who had never been to Luan City before would be stunned by these glittering crystal stones upon their first time entering this city. This included Ye Wansheng, who was a little thick-skinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they entered the city, Ye Wansheng ran up to the buildings and had his Multi Colored Devil Tiger pry these embedded crystals off the wall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they realized what Ye Wansheng was doing, Chu Mu, Chao Lengchuan and Pang Yue acted like they didn’t know him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a spirit dominator rank. yet was still doing these things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Ye Wansheng collected many crystals, he discovered that these weren’t energy crystals and contemptuously said: “Well that made me excited for nothing. Apparently these are useless stones that resemble crystals. They don’t have the least bit of energy.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even an idiot would realize that if these embedded crystals were the normal energy crystals we use to strengthen our soul pets, this city would be too rich.” contemptuously said Pang Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s find a place to rest first.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, it was noon and the sun was hanging high in the air. Chu Mu and the three others had just finished training in Thousand Layer Forest and were very tired.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thousand Layer Forest really was a cornucopia. Old Li’s rate of finding treasures was very high. The four of them had rushed through Thousand Layer Forest and obtained many xuan items. Old Li estimated that they obtained around 80 thousand xuan. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s group only stayed around half a year and obtained the 80 thousand xuan. This efficiency was extremely high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They found a place to stay in a flourishing area. Each person had a room. The first thing the three men did was fall into a deep sleep on their beds before comfortably soaking themselves in a hot water pool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Thousand Layer Forest, although there were a few springs they could use to bathe, since they were in the wilderness, they couldn’t do so comfortably, especially with Ye Wansheng around. Right now Pang Yue didn’t want to do anything else before lie in a hot water bath…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At sunset, the four of them who had spent the afternoon resting had recovered their vitality. Thus, when night fell, they began to walk around Luan City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night scenery was very beautiful, especially from the aesthetic sparkling of the refined crystals. The entire city was lit up in different colors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s initial thoughts were to get rid of the xuan items they obtained as soon as possible, and then exchange them for the xuan items they needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they wanted to do so, they would have to find an exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because Pang Yue was the one leading the way, but they walked and walked and their path kept deviating. Finally, they reached the jewelry market.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Women were unable to resist sparling items. When Chu Mu accompanied Ye Qingzi on their walks, she was like this too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever, you guys shop around. Just find a few high rank xuan teachers while you’re doing so. I’ll go to the exchange to look.” said Chu mu. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.” Pang Yue nodded her head without hesitation. Her eyes didn’t leave the fine jewelry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll go find xuan teachers.” said Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu asked for directions as he walked and easily found the exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People were coming and going in the exchange. The first level was an enormous exchange hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The exchange hall was filled with many people and they were engaging in rather cheap exchanges.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second level was a higher-priced exchange. The third level was an auction and normally only items worth competing for would be placed here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An auction would normally last ten days to half a month. Chu Mu didn’t have any interest in staying here. Therefore, he went straight to the second level to get rid of the fragments of xuan items on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, is there anything you need help with?” sweetly asked a young woman with a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have a few xuan items I wish to sell.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure. May I ask the approximate value of your xuan items? Over 100 xuan, over 1000 xuan or over 10,000 xuan?” asked the reception l ady.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Over 10 thousand.” coolly said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman’s eyes lit up. Anything worth over 5000 xuan had to be auctioned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman instantly gave a deep curtsy and sweetly said: “Ok, please follow me. I’m going to ask for the best appraiser to give you the best price.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu followed the servant girl along the elegant wooden corridor to a luxurious and grand room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corridor was about three meters wide and as they were walking forwards, they encountered a pair of men walking in the opposite direction. These two men were in the middle of a conversation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Kang wanted us to go to Quiet Forest Stronghold City.” said the long chinned man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go where? Why are we going there?” asked the man with a face full of freckles. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know either. We just need to listen to senior’s interests.” said the long chinned man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I’m speaking honestly, I really don’t want to go. Last time I don’t know how many of our Elemental Sect and Departed Spirit Palace members died. Moreover, I heard that countless people from other factions died.” said the freckled man. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ai, what does it matter. All of the benefits were taken by Guang Han Palace’s people. Even if the other factions had more deaths, who would dare complain? Do you even know how many people participated then? At our rank, we have to listen to Senior Kang’s orders. Even if he wants us to throw in our lives, would we dare not do so?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But I heard that Quiet Forest Stronghold City is like a sinking ship that everyone is jumping off of. There are no very strong creatures there anymore. Moreover, after that event, those famous people of the various factions are now being watched by Divine Sect’s members. They won’t dare to appear in Quiet Forest now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It hadn’t been long since Chu Mu had exited New Moon Land. He didn’t know much about the world so when others mentioned matters about large factions, Chu Mu would listen in. This way, he would have a more complete understanding of Wupan territory and Zhengming territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two men spoke as they walked down the stairs and exited the exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Madam, what is Quiet Forest?” asked Chu Mu, curious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that place is a famous land in our Wupan territory. It’s close to Wuji Mountain Range. For a long time in the past it was a place no human dared carelessly enter. However, something serious seemed to have happened a few years ago and Quiet Forest suddenly withered up.” said the receptionist young woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The receptionist young woman’s knowledge was obviously limited, and Chu Mu was only asking out of curiosity. He didn’t actually have any intentions of finding out about the matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they arrived in the room, there was already an old man waiting there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man politely let Chu Mu sit down, and had Chu Mu take out his items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took out his spatial ring with the xuan items in it and gave it to the appraisal master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appraisal master used his soul remembrance to look inside and immediately asked with a start: “Does young master wish to auction these items?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have that much time. You can purchase it from me for the price you appraise.” said Chu Mu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu would rather spend the ten days to half a month training.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appraisal master was a bit surprised. Although the vast majority of the xuan items were bits and pieces, there were a few xuan items worth over 5000. In normal circumstances, to extract the maximum value out of a sixth rank and above xuan item, the item’s owner would request to auction the item. Rarely would they let the auction purchase it from them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, are you sure you don’t want to auction it?” seriously asked the appraisal master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mhm, but don’t let the price you offer disappoint me.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course not!” earnestly said the appraisal master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then give a price.” Chu Mu didn’t waste words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Xiao, steep a good pot of tea for this young master.” the appraisal master said to a woman behind him. Next, he said to Chu Mu, “If young master trusts us, please wait a moment. Is it possible for me to take the items in your spatial ring inside to appraise…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take it.” Chu Mu wasn’t afraid of the exchange embezzling anything since Old Li had already helped Chu Mu calculate the value of the xuan items inside already.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appraisal master laughed and carefully took the ring. He was walking into the back room when the woman named Xiao Xiao happened to brush by his shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appraisal master’s expression didn’t change as he said to the woman: “Spend time having a conversation with this young master. He’s a great lord with over 50 thousand worth of xuan…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman’s eyes flashed with a sliver of impatience, but she forced a smile and kept walking forwards. The younger the rich person was, the harder it was to deal with. Despite only having been here a short period of time, Xiao Xiao believed firmly in this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello, my name is Xiao Xiao. How should I address young master?” Xiao Xiao placed the cake and pastries next to Chu Mu. She maintained a faint smile as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu.” Chu Mu had been relaxing with his eyes closed. When this woman asked him a question, he barely raised his eyelids.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu raising his eyelids was a normal reaction towards strangers. Normally, it didn’t matter how beautiful the other person was, Chu Mu would just go back to resting with his eyes closed. He couldn’t be bothered to keep conversing with these business people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this time after Chu Mu raised his eyelids, his eyes opened wide and he stared at the woman for a few seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao restrained her impulsive anger and lowered her head to pour tea for Chu Mu. She silently cursed in her heart why there were so many of these frivolous and extremely conceited rich young masters everywhere in Luan City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, here is your tea.” Xiao Xiao didn’t change her expression as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.” Chu Mu nodded his head and finished his tea in one gulp. He puzzlingly muttered in his heart: This woman looks a lot like Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant Chu Mu raised his eyelids, he genuinely thought it was Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s eyebrows were thin and beautiful. Her eyes were soft and shimmering. Her cheeks were small but not lacking in ampleness. This woman had the same simple but elegant temperament that wasn’t particularly outstanding in any aspect; yet the more one looked, the more one would find her to his tastes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman called Xiao Xiao was about 50% similar to Ye Qingzi in terms of looks and 70% in terms of temperament. Indeed, Chu Mu was able to sense that even though she was politely smiling, she was maintaining a restrained indifference. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Chu Mu forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a long time since he had seen Ye Qingzi and he missed her a lot. It went so far that when he saw someone that looked similar to her, he actually had a split second misperception.&nbsp;</span></p>
