The Yellow Springs Path is the true gate of death. All powerful demons are buried here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, you must be surprised why Paramita, Three Roads, Forgotten River and Yellow Springs are so strong, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The reason is very simple. Paramita, Three Roads, Forgotten River and Yellow Springs are the four strongest demons chosen out of all the challenging demons!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Entering Immortal Heavenly Realm is easier said than done. It’s more than just defeating the four guardians. All challenging demons must defeat the four guardians and then replace their guardian position. WIthin a span of four years, if they haven’t been replaced by another demon, they will have the qualifications to wear the demon crown and enter Demonic Burial Mound’s inner island.” the old raccoon man pointed at the demon crown in the screen of light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Defeating the guardians and then replacing them for four years was a demanding requirement. It was no wonder the second Demonic Burial Mound’s precipice had so many graves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long long long long long~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shaking turned incomparably violent and all of the navy members turned their heads in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone discovered that the large corpse army was no longer far from them. They could feel that an enormous bone dragon was at the front of the large corpse army, violently charging forwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dense corpse aura filled Yellow Springs Path. If one were to stand there, he or she would probably choke to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the spacious Yellow Springs Path, a lonely and cold figure stood there. Compared to the entire large corpse army, its body was insignificantly small. However, the demon aura it released made it look like an enormous ice mountain that the large corpse army was unable to traverse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The boundless large corpse army pressed onwards, but the lonely black figure remained standing there, not moving an inch!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hui!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a demonic dream cry rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The prideful noise suppressed the loud rumbling of the large corpse army. The cry was filled with power as it reverberated around Yellow Springs Path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black dream soul suddenly appeared. Big Leader Xu Kuang astonishingly discovered that Yellow Springs’ body was enshrouded by an enormous night soul. It was like its body had transformed into a night demon that dominated everything. In its kingly state, it looked down on the restless corpse army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night’s cry seemed to make time stop. The tide-like corpse army that devoured everything came to a sudden halt a hundred meters away from Night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corpse creatures leading the charge were dominator ranks. However, when they saw Yellow Springs, none of them dared show any rash movements, nor did they dare take another step forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was possible to see the fear in the eyes of these savage creatures. Their bodies were unconsciously bowing down!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thousands of spectators all showed expressions of shock after the large corpse army froze in place. This was a domineering scene. An enormous army stopping because of a single cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes fell on Night. As they looked at its lonely figure, the shock in their hearts didn’t calm for a long while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Yellow Springs. The second Demonic Burial Mound’s strongest demon!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An imposing creature that could stun a large corpse army of tens of thousands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a long while before Big Leader Xu Kuang came back to his senses. He knew that when he had fought against Yellow Springs just now, Yellow Springs hadn’t used its full strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang looked in disbelief at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Yellow Springs was really his soul pet?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">f this was the case, this fellow had a fox noble that could defeat Forgotten River and the strongest demon in the second Demonic Burial Mound. This was a terrifying amount of strength!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brath, you’re the original master of Yellow Springs, right?” the old raccoon man’s voice slowly came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu returned to his senses and nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve paid attention to Yellow Springs for a long time. I began to pay attention once it stepped onto Demonic Burial Mound because I smelled the scent of someone from my species. I presume that it was this fellow who guided you to Demonic Burial Mound, right?” said the old raccoon man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Li?” Chu Mu could only think of Old Li. But for some reason, this rotten old man refused to appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should understand that there are too many demons in Demonic Burial Mound with outstanding innate talent. But even if they are dominator rank species, there will be many who die a premature death. Thus, it will be extremely difficult for a commander rank demon to survive in a land of the powerful like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t help but admit that I underestimated its toughness, perseverance, and determination. When it first entered Demonic Burial Mound, it was weak. But this island that is full of opportunities and resources also gave it, an indomitable soul pet, the greatest room to grow!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Its strength managed to fly in a short few years. It went from being on the outskirts of the island to the first Demonic Burial Mound where it stayed an entire year. Allmost every day it would attempt the precipice, trying to find a path that would allow it to enter the precipice!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve been here for several hundred years and have seen countless strong soul pets. However, a soul pet as dedicated as it is truly rare.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There was a time when it challenged the first Demonic Burial Mound’s precipice and only had a single breath remaining. Hiding its aura, it hid in a tree hole. I thought that it would give up after this so I appeared in front of it and told it that reaching the peak emperor rank was enough already.” slowly narrated the old raccoon man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stared at Night who was blocking the large corpse army, refusing to move away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the large corpse army had been stunned by Night, a few high class dominator corpse leaders were letting out sharp cries. Obviously, they wanted to challenge Yellow Springs’ dignity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These corpses were all challengers who had failed. Even in death, the resentment in their souls pushed them to challenge the guardians.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night had already been challenged by these dominator rank corpses. There were a total of twenty high class dominator rank corpses. They were looking with fear at Night, while Night calmly stood there. It was exactly like when it had faced Xu Kuang and the others: like an unmoving and grand icy mountain!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These reckless resentment corpses!” berated the old raccoon man. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old raccoon man paused briefly before continuing: “You should be able to guess what happened next. Although it nearly died, after it recovered, it began to challenge the first Demonic Burial Mound precipice again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the end, I ignored this obstinate fellow and instead sent the Paramita of that time to continue watching over it. Everyone once in a while, Paramita would tell me that it lost, it lost, it lost… I was confused then what made it so willing to persevere. What on earth was making it so obstinate?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But when I was used to its defeats, or perhaps it’s more apt to say when I was just waiting for news of its death, there was suddenly a day when Paramita told me that it climbed to the top of the precipice and entered Demonic Burial Mound’s middle island!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old raccoon man stroked his own beard. He squinted his eyes and looked with a sliver of appreciation at Night who was fighting with the resentment corpses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Demonic Burial Mound’s middle island. This place is full of even more opportunities, but is also filled with more cruel competition.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once it climbed the precipice, it became a weakling again and had to seek survival again at the lowest level…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I looked after it a little, but whether it was able to enter the peak dominator rank ultimately was up to itself.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truthfully speaking, I really never thought it would be able to survive nor that its strength would fly up. This probably has something to do with its nomadic bloodline…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Night was weaving through the resentment corpses which would immediately shatter right after.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night’s attacks were extremely strange. Before the corpses around a resentment corpse had reacted, that resentment corpse would be instakilled. It was fast and sharp as well as without any warning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s its signature technique, Demon Dream Shatter. Many dominator rank demons on the middle island that looked down on it would perish under this attack.” said the old raccoon man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Listening to the old raccoon man’s description, Chu Mu was able to imagine the hardships Night endured after entering Demonic Burial Mound’s middle island. Indeed, there were high species rank demons all over the middle island and it would suffer bullying, contempt and exclusion…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night’s cold eyes were not trained from slaughter, instead, they were the result of being bullied and looked down on by stronger creatures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Demonic Burial Mound is like this. As long as your species rank is low, you can only endure everything and carefully survive. Nonetheless, at the very end, you will be able to trample upon your enemies because there are too many unknown factors on this island!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Night was able to kill its enemies and steal xuan items from their territories. It managed to flee from the pursuit of enormous demon armies and lower its head and swallow its words under the bullying of stronger demons…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this. It takes an intense strain on the mind. To obtain a xuan item, the price is a body full of wounds. Yet, because a stronger soul pet suddenly appeared, in order to survive, you must give up this xuan item.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old raccoon man’s words caused Chu Mu’s heart to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The feeling it must have left was painful and disturbing. Indeed, it was already incredibly difficult to obtain a xuan item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has its pride, but understood when to lower its head. This is something many demons with high species ranks are unable to do. Therefore, it managed to survive and those demons that ridiculed, looked down and bullied it were eventually trampled under its feet. Just like those pitiful resentment corpses. Why wouldn’t there be demons among the corpses that once trampled it under their feet?” the old raccoon man pointed at the resentment corpses that were being defeated one by one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The path of survival and the path of experts were filled with bumps, hardships and a mix of blood and tears. Only by surviving until the end could one become a genuine expert!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang and the others were listening to the old raccoon man’s description. Initially, they were astonished by Yellow Springs’ species rank. Indeed, the Night Thunder Dream Beast was a commander rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after listening to the old raccoon man’s description, they suddenly understood that the Yellow Springs of today that was powerful enough to look down on all dominator rank creatures had walked an extremely bumpy path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its power wasn’t innate. In fact, it merely possessed a weak commander bloodline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it had walked to the end!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had become the current Yellow Springs, the strongest demon of Demonic Burial Mound’s middle island!&nbsp;</span></p>
