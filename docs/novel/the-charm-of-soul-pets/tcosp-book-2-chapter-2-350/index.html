However, he didn’t know what was going on the surface...</span></p>

The ruins in the wasteland were swept up into the air by this enormous energy; it was omnipotent and brought enormous pressure onto Lu Lishan and the other three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Lishan firmly grit his teeth, and wished nothing more than to cut this fellow who deliberately made trouble in thousands of pieces.</span></p>

When they came together, chanted an incantation at the same time and released techniques at the same time, the technique formed would have destruction force that was far more terrifying than other types of soul pet groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!” finally, Lu Shanli had no choice but to give the order. A dozen ninth rank wind type techniques could rip through the earth, and even if Lu Shanli was stronger, he still wouldn’t be able to withstand it. Furthermore, while fighting against the other type commander, his soul pets’ fighting strength had been damaged.</span></p>

Yet, they were helpless about the large group of tenth phase wind type soul pets that had come this time. Although they were people that often traversed eighth rank bewildering worlds, without a complete plan for it, it would be extremely hard to kill these wind type soul pets.</span></p>

However, its speed was visibly incapable of escaping the engulfing wind technique after being wounded. Ultimately, it was swallowed up by several ninth rank wind type techniques. Its tiny body was ravaged by the powerful wind force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wind type technique attacks had extremely wide range, especially when several ninth phase techniques overlayed to form a wind calamity. Whatever place it passed over, nothing remained. The broken walls and rocks were even swept up and hovered several meters high in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wind type soul pets were so angry that they ostensibly vented it all on the surrounding inhabitant soul pets. They unceasingly released techniques and unceasingly caused destruction. They desolated the storm area so badly that the majority of the area practically had nothing left there. The irascible soul pets which were unable to bear the Storm Fairies all fled this place.</span></p>

Of course, the supply was extremely little. Chu Mu guessed that only about two days later, the manufactured oxygen would be incapable of meeting the requirements for Chu Mu and his soul pets to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu himself didn’t know how long it had been, only that it was slowly becoming hard to breathe. Chu Mu also felt it was time to return to the surface.</span></p>

When he reached twenty meters, Chu Mu sent out his soul remembrance to scout out the surrounding state of affairs to make sure there were no wind type soul petes. After doing so, he finally crawled up to the surface and saw the light again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This group of wind type soul pets was honestly terrifying!” when Chu Mu returned to the ground, he was no longer on the ground. The Ancient Wasteland City had been a large set of ruins with a large amount of unchecked undergrowth. However, at the moment, it could no longer even be called a wasteland; instead, it was closer to a scattered mess after a calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everywhere was clouded hazy while the violent and biting cold wind continued to beat against him. Looking at the surroundings, Chu Mu could imagine how terrifying it was when these soul pets were gathered together and angry. Everything in a range of 1000 meters had been completely overturned...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu knew that these wind type soul pets could still be around and didn’t remain. He recalled his Devil Tree Battle Soldier and Ghost King, and summoned the Night Thunder Dream Beast. He went directly towards the place he had entered the ancient city at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon leaving this area, Chu Mu could clearly feel an aura of storm in the surrounding, These wind type soul pets obviously hadn’t given up and when Chu Mu rode on his soul pet nearby as he passed them, these wind type soul pets let out angry shouts. They gathered the other wind type soul pets and followed behind Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Night Thunder Dream Beast’s running speed would make them tired. At the beginning, these Wind Fairies and Storm Fairies were still able to keep up, but as it picked up speed, these soul pets were gradually left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t pause at all and was as fast as lightning. As long as he could leave this ancient city, the 100 million reward would be his!</span></p>

This 100 million bounty was too difficult; including the four Nightmare Palace people from before, the mission they were going to complete before identically wasn’t easy. It seemed that after he returned, Chu Mu felt that he needed to negotiate the reward with that Moushan person.&nbsp;</span></p>

After putting away the ring, Chu Mu took out the Ancient Wasteland map and searched for his location.</span></p>

However, Chu Mu had heard it very distinctly.</span></p>

It wasn’t until the anger of those wind type soul pets caused Lu Shanli’s party of people who were purportedly his accomplices to use powerful ninth rank techniques that Chu Mu realized Lu Shanli was still in the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, Lu Shanli had also diverted the attention of these scattered wind type soul pets, otherwise they wouldn’t have so easily dispersed.&nbsp;</span></p>

The faster the better!” Chu Mu didn’t realize he would provoke Lu Shanli and his heart promptly sank. He had the Night Thunder Dream Beast try and leave this place as fast as possible.</span></p>
