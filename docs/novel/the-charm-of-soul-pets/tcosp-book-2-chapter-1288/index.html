 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pirates couldn’t sit still anymore. No matter what, they didn’t expect the situation to become like this when they had them outnumbered over ten times!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, New Moon Navy was fighting back to back like fierce tigers. No matter how many people they had or how powerful their assaults were, they couldn’t break their formation. The scarier thing was the New Moon Navy had truly too many high class dominator rank soul pets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pirate leaders that Hai Qie mentioned were the only people with high class dominator rank soul pets of the pirates. Added together, it was four to five.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking back at New Moon Navy, Chu Mu himself already had two high class dominator ranks. Little hidden dragon was frenziedly devouring souls in the beast type army while the devil tree battle soldier stood in the new moon navy creating a flawless defense. Even dominator ranks couldn’t get near New Moon Navy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a group battle, the devil tree battle soldier could be much more effective than its own rank entails. After getting the wood xuan leaf, it had an attacking power near that of a top tier dominator rank. Adding on its natural advantage in large groups, one could say without exaggerating that the devil tree battle soldier was like a top tier dominator rank soul pet guarding the New Moon Navy. He could kill however many that come his way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than Chu Mu’s two high class dominator ranks, Chao Lengchuan also summoned two high class dominator ranks, his thousand wave baest and Lin Yin beast. These two beasts were stampeding through the lower rank backlines of the pirates. Sometimes, even without casting techniques, simply slamming their way through the ranks was enough to kill a large amount of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following that were Ye Wansheng’s high class dominator rank soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bold Empress Heavenly Thunder Snake destroyed countless pirates’ inner defenses. There was also a Multi Colored Devil Tiger hiding within the chaos instantly killing any soul pet under middle class dominator rank, causing the leader rank pirates to not even dare show their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Sang Ying made his way through demon burial mound, he also had two high class dominators. Hai Qie also had three high class dominator rank soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Added together, New Moon Navy had 11 high class dominator ranks. Even if five were occupied by the leaders of pirates, the six on the battlefield were demolishing their ranks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only that, but the pirates’ elemental soul pets were constantly occupied by the experienced Yuan Sui, while the New Moon Navy’s elemental soul pets could constantly barrage the enemy. Their destruction was sometimes even scarier than high class dominator ranks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They….. How do they have so many high class dominator ranks!” Female leader Chang Fei said with a face full of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great leader Zhuo Qing’s face was incredibly grave. From the enemy’s strength, he could tell that they didn’t come by mistake but definitely came to kill them all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leader Zhuo, those demons are too sneaky, I….’ Old Zhong came back defeated, saying with a face of resentment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old pirate Zhong had just brought 2000 soul pets towards Yuan Sui’s demon team. However, after entering the forest, his people were killed one by one until only 1000 remained. At that point, the pirate Old Zhong no longer dared to continue the chase because at a certain breaking point, the demons would be able to clean the rest of them up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Qing’s face was already utterly black. He stared angrily at Old Zhong, “Didn’t you say this group of New Moon Ground people was very weak? Why are they showing the strength of a Wupan Navy?”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…. I…..” Old Zhong couldn’t give an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even he didn't know why the new moon navy people were this powerful!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every member had emperor rank soul pets, they had a full demon team, plant team, elemental army, beast type army, aerial army. It was hard to imagine that a third rank realm that had barely developed for a few years could have this many spirit emperors!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Qing humphed, causing Old Zhong’s body to turn cold with fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could feel Zhuo King’s killing intent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great leader Zhou Qing could no longer sit still. The enemy’s army was already much stronger than the pirates. Adding on all the high class dominator ranks sweeping through, he wouldn’t have many pirates left if he waited any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great leader Zhuo Qing chanted an incantation and summoned his main soul pet first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main soul pet he summoned was a Calamity Spider Emperor. Its eight legs were scarily sunken into the rocky ground. Any casual swipe could probably split open countless people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From its aura, one could tell that it was definitely top tier dominator rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Calamity Spider Emperor stepped forth and walked right through the battlefield. No technique could leave even a scratch on its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The calamity spider emperor climbed all the way to the sandy beach with Zhuo Qing on its back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s your leader, do you dare to come and fight me?” Great leader Zhuo Qing roared. His high remembrance spirit dominator power instantly covered the entire battlefield with his voice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pirates’ morales were at an all time low. Zhuo Qing had to bring it back up, or his subordinates will all be cleaned up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under this aura, he could clearly feel that all pirates were reinvigorated as if given some status technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was simple why this was the case. All of the pirates still continued to fight because they believed in their great leader’s strength. They knew that as long as the great leader Zhuo Qing fought, the situation would flip around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Morale was incredibly important in group battles. The pirates were already slightly scared from all the deaths. If the great leader Zhuo Qing was beaten here, they would disperse into scared masses and the battle would quickly end with clean up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu glanced over the battlefield. Up until now, the losses weren’t huge. However, Chu Mu wasn’t sure if something could happen to change this. In the end, there still were a lot of pirates. Though they could use the high class dominator rank advantage to kill a lot initially, they inevitably will have losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy had just been created. If they lost even a third of their people, it would be a great loss. Chu Mu felt he had to control the losses at a minimum and defeat them all in one go!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The best way to do this was to kill their great leader Zhuo Qing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Zhuo Qing already called for a challenge, why wouldn’t Chu Mu dare to fight? In fact, even if great leader Zhuo Qing didn’t come, Chu Mu was about to go, find him, and kill him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn't retract the little hidden dragon and devil tree battle soldier and told them to continue fighting. Instead, he summoned Night and went towards the great leader Zhuo Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battlefield was incredibly chaotic. Almost every second, techniques flew through the air. However, to Night, it was all just air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Easily traversing the battlefield, Chu Mu told Night to hide its aura when he slowly approached Zhuo Qing on the sandy beach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the New Moon leader? Dare you give a name?” Zhuo Qing stared sharply at Chu Mu, who came up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Qing picked this sandy beach because it was on the side of the battlefield and actually was closer to the pirates’ headquarters. What Zhuo Qing was slightly shocked by was the enemy general dared to come up himself. This courage caused Zhuo Qing to be slightly uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu.” Chu Mu said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu?” Zhuo Qing furrowed his brows, feeling like he heard it from somewhere before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great leader, its the new moon ground king that Old Zhong mentioned before.” Chang Fei behind him quickly reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Qing realized then. So the leader figures of New Moon Ground were all on this boat, no wonder they were this powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Ground King Chu, what an honor.” Great leader Zhuo Qing smiled strangely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked at the suddenly changed Zhuo Qing, and no longer knew what kind of trick he was trying to play.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Chu Mu was confused, suddenly the great leader Zhuo Qing used his mental remembrance to speak. After listening to it, Chu Mu couldn’t help but find it funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu, I won’t beat around the bush. Your navy is very strong, comparable to even Wupan Navy. However, we Dark Ocean Pirates are many in number. If we continue to fight, even if you win, you will lose most of your people. Such a lose lose situation isn’t something either of us want.” Great leader Zhuo Qing said in a more mild tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lose lose, you overestimate yourselves.” Chu Mu wasn’t in a hurry, so he wanted to see what Zhuo Qing could offer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, even if you can win, so what? The dark ocean pirates cover the entirety of the Guan Ocean and reach the hundred thousands in total. We have four hundred thousand soul pets. This time you found our headquarters and can clean us up. Give me a few years, though, and I can recreate the same group of people. Then, the dark ocean pirates will be a frequent visitor of New Moon Ground.” Great leader Zhuo Qing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? Then what do you want instead?” Chu Mu said with his mental voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You come here either for bounties or treasures. I can give you 30,000 xuan for you to leave now. I can also guarantee you that we will never come to New Moon Ground. We can even stop other pirates from going.” Zhuo Qing said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Qing’s words caused Chu Mu to be surprised. Speaking truthfully, Chu Mu didn’t imagine the vicious pirate leader could actually give such a suggestion of peace even after he killed so many opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maybe this was the way of survival for pirates. They backed off from the strong and bullied the weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your head has 30,000 xuan. The ten leaders together have another 20,000 xuan. With the rest added together, there’s much more than 6,000. Adding on the storage in their nest, it should amount to 10,000 xuan. Which do you think I would pick?” Chu Mu teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Qing’s face was black already, but it was distorted at this point!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, Chu Mu didn’t care about him, even saying he wanted Zhuo Qing’s head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heng, clueless fool. I just didn’t want my subordinates to die. In front of Zhuo Qing, you, the New Moon Ground King, is trash!” Zhuo Qing instantly switched expressions as killing intent poured out of him!</span></p>
