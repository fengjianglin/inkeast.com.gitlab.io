Do you know why that large corpse army is so afraid of it? Is it really because it is Yellow River?” continued the old raccoon man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook his head. He didn’t understand. The large corpse army had an extremely high amount of numbers. If they wanted to break through Yellow Springs Path, Night wouldn’t be able to stop them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the large corpse army had stopped. It refused to move forward. Only those with higher resentment aura dared challenge Night’s dignity. However, those corpses would ultimately be trampled into pieces. They weren’t Night’s opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This story begins from when it began challenging Yellow Springs Path…” the old raccoon man continued his story. From his tone, his admiration and respect for Night could be heard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This path is filled with death. Even stronger demons than there are now will die. Moreover, once you step on this path, there’s no method of return because the corpses that have met their eternal rest here are filled with resentment and will not permit defeated challengers to safely return to middle island.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, it had already stepped onto the peak of middle island. I thought that it would decide to become middle island’s demon king. However, when it no longer had many opponents left on middle island, it without hesitation decided to step onto Yellow Springs Path. This was even after I told it this was a path of no return... “&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When it stepped on the path, there were a total of three demons that challenged the path with it. These three demons were the strongest existences on middle island and were also demons that wanted to surpass themselves! These three demons were the Angry Horn Devil, the Shadow Beast, and the Seven Sins Fox Rock Emperor…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This team of demons was very strong. The Angry Horn Devil defeated last generation’s Paramita, the Shadow Beast beat the last generation’s Three Roads and the Seven Sins Fox Rock Emperor defeated the last generation’s Forgotten River. These three demons replaced the third guardian and are now defending Yellow Springs Path.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, Night which had strength equivalent to those three great demons was the one to challenge Yellow Springs.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The last generation’s Yellow Springs was also respected, and were once the strongest demon on middle island. Moreover, no demon was able to even shake it. The new generation’s four strongest demons didn’t have a great strength discrepancy between themselves, including Night. So when it challenged the last generation’s Yellow Springs, it should have lost.” At this point, the old raccoon man intentionally paused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And then?” Chao Lengchuan pressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was listening to Yellow Spring’s path of growth. They were listening so intently they were entranced. All of these soul pet trainers had climbed up the cultivation path and those that had climbed from the very bottom empathized with the story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Obviously it defeated Yellow Springs in the end; otherwise, how would it have replaced the last generation’s Yellow Springs?” said Hai Qie.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone nodded their heads. This should be the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the old raccoon man shook his head and continued: “You guys are wrong. It lost and was completely defeated. Ultimately, it was tossed by Yellow Springs into the underground river next to it. Its corpse was washed away with the flow of water to the grave you guys walked in front of us earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Corp… corpse? It was defeated… and then killed?” Hai Qie’s face was full of astonishment as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night was killed by the previous generation’s Yellow Springs?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if it was killed, why did it replace Yellow Springs? What else happened there?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It died and its soul pact ruptured…” Chu Mu muttered to himself, dazed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, Demonic Burial Mound. The graveyard for demons. Countless demons will die here. Even those I’ve watched over for so many years... they will still ultimately die. I find this rather regretful, but I also know this is only normal.” the old raccoon man said. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Xu Kuang nodded his head and said: “Before it died, it became one of the four strongest demons in middle island. This is an extremely high honor for demons. Demonic Burial Mound is both the graveyard for demons and also their homes. Many demons wish to be buried here upon death…” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, does death mean the end? At the beginning I thought that was the case too…” the old raccoon man laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Death doesn’t mean the end?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was confused. Was Night revived? However, the revival techniques in this world were held only in the extremely strong creatures’ hands. Could it really be revived?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It hasn’t revived. It’s the exact same as most corpses. It became a member of the graveyard and its body was absorbed into the river, transforming into a pile of white bones - a White Bone Dream Beast. However, different from all the other zombies in the graveyard, it didn’t feel dejected, frightened or panicked. Instead, the first thing it did after climbing out from the pile of bones was to defeat the corpse type creatures around it!!” said the old raccoon man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard this, Chu Mu was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never would have imagined that Night became a pile of white bones that then stood up and became a departed spirit Dream Beast!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Departed spirit creatures didn’t appear simply from the refinement of a death aura. The creature’s grievances had to be enormous. If Night was able to climb out of the white bones not long after death, it meant that its grievances were extremely deep!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When the vast majority of demons become a pile of white bones, they will lose their consciousness or their body will be possessed by grievance, which will spill over into greed and domination. On the one hand, they are unwilling to accept the terrifying reality of becoming a pile of white bones turned departed spirit and on the other hand, the lingering feeling of death in their hearts will cause them to wallow away in despair!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, it was different. After becoming a White Bone Dream Beast, its strength took a great dip and it once more descended the lowest level of this realm.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The truth is that I think that only the undying body of a departed spirit is capable of matching its unbending willpower.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After becoming a White Bone Dream Beast, it didn’t stop climbing. With its white bones, it kept climbing no matter how high the corpse mountain was. You guys can imagine the plethora of times its body was torn and bones were shattered. It had to endure this in order to climb to the top! Then, when its body was torn and bones were shattered, it would have to find and retrieve its bones back amidst the boundless corpse slaughter…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white bones were endless. There were tens of thousands of departed spirits here, accumulated over countless years. In this dark and sunless precipice cave, it was possible to imagine how insignificant a defeated demon was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu couldn’t restrain his emotions. The only thing in his mind was Night’s cold and emotionless black eyes that had been baptised through its rough experiences. Whether it was the Night Thunder Dream Beast or White Bone Dream Beast, its eyes would still flicker with the strongest unbending and unyielding radiance!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As I said before, Demonic Burial Mound is full of opportunities. As long as you are able to survive…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This includes surviving in the departed spirit form!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As it climbed, it relied on its rank superiority from when it was alive and gradually defeated the corpse type experts in the precipice cave. It relied on its willpower to stand at the very top of the entire large corpse army and became the departed spirit general among tens of thousands of corpse and the strongest departed spirit in the entire precipice of the Demonic Burial Mound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I heard the news for the Seven Sins Fox Rock Emperor, the shock in my heart was difficult to describe. I thought that it had fallen, but when I least expected it to, it reached the summit. It didn’t matter if it fell to the lowly departed spirit realm, it was still going to stand at the very top!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old raccoon man’s eyes glittered as it stared at Night. It was a long while before it continued:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now you do you understand why the large corpse army is afraid of it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone thought that the large corpse army had stopped in its tracks because of the intimidation from the special status of Yellow Springs. Who would have thought that this Yellow Springs had actually climbed out from the large corpse army and was once a corpse leader?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its tyrannical nature from its past as a corpse leader was fully displayed. Indeed, of the twenty resentment corpses, there were not even ten remaining now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skeletons of the ten resentment corpses were scattered over Yellow Springs Path and they were being stepped on by Yellow Springs like carpets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the initial twenty resentment corpses surrounding it, Yellow Springs only had two light wounds on its body. Thus, before it did anything more, the ten remaining resentment corpses that were greatly inferior in strength began to tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each time their body was shattered, their strengths would decrease. Therefore, these resentment corpse leaders refused to attack Night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind them, the large corpse army didn’t dare step forward either. The one standing in front of them used to be the strongest departed spirit and there were many departed spirits that it had personally defeated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps against an army of tens of thousands, the strongest departed spirit would ultimately be devoured, but the grandeur and tyrannical aura from the strongest aura was capable of smashing an entire army’s fighting intent. Indeed, all of the departed spirits knew that if they attacked, they would inevitably be shattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old raccoon man looked at the large corpse army that refused to move forwards. A cold smile appeared on his face. Obviously, this was within his expectations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Departed spirit creatures were innately defeated creatures that were brought back to life. Despite their greediness and ruthlessness, they were unable to free themselves of the shadow of defeat and fear. They didn’t have the courage to challenge a true leader of departed spirits. If they did dare challenge, they would inevitably be shattered by its powerful strength, becoming part of the departed spirit leader’s cornerstone of power and authority. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yellow Springs Path rejects nobody. Even departed spirits can challenge the path!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After becoming the leader of the departed spirits, it challenged Yellow Springs again in its departed spirits identity!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yellow Springs from the last generation was very strong. After this generation’s Yellow Springs’ body was shattered, it was tossed again like garbage into the underground river.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was already a departed spirit so the shattering merely decreased part of its strength. When it recovered its strength, it challenged again and again and again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the old raccoon man suddenly turned to Chu Mu and he said in a low voice: “Each time I saw it climb out from the pile of corpse skeletons and then silently drag its deformed body to find its scattered bones, I really wanted to know what on earth made it so resilient.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From a weak demon to when it stepped over the first precipice. From the lowest dominator rank to the leader of the four great demons. From the lowest corpse to the leader of a mad army. All the way until the last generation’s Yellow Springs was defeated by its dedication…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even death was unable to destroy its conviction. But why though?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old raccoon man’s words were directed to Chu Mu. It knew that the answer was on this human.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the years watching over Yellow Springs, it had never seen Yellow Springs shed a tear. Only when this human walked towards it did tears fall from its cold black eyes... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What on earth made Night so resilient?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew. Chu Mu knew very well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew only because when Night had left him in Tianxia Plains and he watched it run off into the distance, he had said: &nbsp;</span></p>
