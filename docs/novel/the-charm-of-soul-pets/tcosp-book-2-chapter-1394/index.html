 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through it's communication skills, Mo Xie had finally convinced the little dragon cub to persuade its parent to shift a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling and Xia Yin were still a little afraid. The Martial Cloud Dragon showed no intention of leaving the spot. There were probably not many who could actually meditate peacefully under the watch of a wild dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who knew if the Martial Cloud Dragon would suddenly start treating them as eyesores and would simply wipe them out with a dragon breath while they were busy meditating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had interacted with wild soul pets before. As long as the communication was settled, he was not worried about the Martial Cloud Dragon suddenly becoming enraged. After all, Mo Xie was accompanying its cub as a playmate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Little Hidden Dragon was still young, Mo Xie was it's full-time babysitter. Hence, Mo Xie was already familiar with babysitting a dragon cub. Soon, the dragon cub was following behind Mo Xie wherever it went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon was not completely free of worry about its child. It would secretly open its eyes once in a while to check. Once it ensured the cub’s safety, it would continue snoring. It had always been paying careful attention to its child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We better not target the cub. The Martial Cloud Dragon doesn’t seem to detest humans. However, if we were to show any ulterior motives, it will definitely attack us,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon’s race rank was very high. A Martial Cloud Dragon cub’s value far surpassed that of many Immortal items. Honesty speaking, even Lin Mengling and Xia Yin were slightly tempted after seeing its cub playing around in front of them despite having experienced large events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, considering the strength of the Martial Cloud Dragon before them, it would already be the best for them if they could simply stay together peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a period of contact, the three realized that the Martial Cloud Dragon truly did not show any hostility. Hence, they no longer paid attention to the snoring powerful creature and stood on the three corners of the triangular cultivation formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin asked Lin Mengling, “You know the initiation incantation, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling shook her head and turned to Chu Mu, “Only Saintess Yu should know the incantation to operate this formation. She should have told you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded and began chanting while he stood at the triangular formation node.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the incantation continued, a stream of light started flowing along the carved patterns of the triangular formation and it slowly lit up the entire formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The triangular formation gradually erected a triangle star formation. At the same time, the summit of the three mountains shot out light beams and that were connected at the tips, becoming a huge triangle star formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The big and small formation resonated with each other. Suddenly, the air current within the entire pot valley rapidly changed, as if the air was suddenly vacuumed out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the air was vacuumed out, the ferocious air currents from the surroundings surged in. The approaching air currents contained vast amounts of energy, it was as if a dried up sea was suddenly flooded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dense Immortal Aura started pouring into the triangular formation and hit the three. The three of them knew the value of this energy and hurriedly entered into the state of meditation. They began to desperately absorb the energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Aura was like the fuel for the spirit world. After continuous accumulation of it, it would stir up a wave to help break through the ninth remembrance limit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wave required continuous accumulation. Chu Mu, Xia Yin and Lin Mengling knew the rarity of Immortal Aura, so they did not want to waste any of that energy and immediately focused on cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the cultivation formation was activated, the Martial Cloud Dragon immediately stopped snoring. It turned its head to look at the three humans sitting inside the formation curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon naturally sensed the Immortal Aura swarming towards the humans. However, that amount of Immortal Aura could not help it raise its rank anymore. On the other hand, it was beneficial towards the growth of its child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon opened its mouth and held its child with its mouth, then it put it down in the cultivation formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon cub simply stood there in confusion and did not know what to do. The Martial Cloud Dragon spoke a few words in their native language and the cub finally settled down. It obediently lay inside the cultivation formation and began sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, Xia Yin and Lin Mengling had sensed the little cub entering the cultivation formation simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon cub was a low rank, so the Immortal Aura that it absorbed was insignificant. As it would not snatch their resources from them, they only opened their eyes to take a slight glance at the cute snoring cub before continuing with their meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie also returned to Chu Mu’s shoulder. The lingering Immortal Aura caused its surroundings to be filled with warmth. It was the most suitable environment for sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie yawned and dove right into Chu Mu’s bosom to find a comfortable position to take a nap in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu opened his eyes with a bitter smile. This little creature simply disliked going back to the soul pet space to sleep, so he could only hug it in the end......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie did not absorb the Immortal Aura. However, letting it just sleep in such an environment would certainly be beneficial to it. Chu Mu still ended up deciding to inject a portion of the Immortal Aura he absorbed into Mo Xie to raise its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivation was a very boring process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, every powerful individual had to go through this boring process. Chu Mu, Xia Yin and Lin Mengling had enough patience to complete this boring cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, they could easily last for a few months after settling down like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the first day, the three never opened their eyes after they had completely settled down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same for the second day. They had to absorb the Immortal Aura and convert it into their own power. This was a complicated process that did not allow for any form of distraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the third day, they were still focused on cultivating. By now, that little dragon cub had already woken up and it walked around in the triangle formation out of boredom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The adult Martial Cloud Dragon was sleeping, and Mo Xie was also sleeping. The three humans were peacefully cultivating. Only the innocent little dragon cub could not understand why they had to cultivate. It dragged its chubby body and ran onto the adult Martial Cloud Dragon’s head at times, then ran to Chu Mu’s side and pulled tiny Mo Xie’s tails at times, then ran to bite Lin Mengling’s skirt at times......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ao~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the adult Martial Cloud Dragon opened its large jaws to yawn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gust of storm swept out from the direction of the yawn into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon slowly spread out its wings. The majestic blue membrane wings at it engulfed the ground looked extremely intimidating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon stretched its body a few times that had been lying down for a few months and it slowly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took a glance at the three humans who were still cultivating and did not bother them. It only lowered its head and held its child in its mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little dragon cub knew that its mother was about to leave with it. Hence, it pulled Mo Xie’s tail hard and woke Mo Xie up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwu~!” cried Mo Xie while still half asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past few months, the three humans and the adult Martial Cloud Dragon did not move a single inch. Only Mo Xie would occasionally get up and bring it to stroll around outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that they were leaving, the little dragon cub naturally wanted to tell Mo Xie about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huhuhuhu~!” The little dragon cub’s eyes were wet with tears, it seemed very reluctant to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie saw that it was getting so depressed and gave the final bit of snacks to it. The little dragon cub immediately swept clean all of the snacks and it no longer cried. It happily left with the adult Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the little dragon cub left, it was Mo Xie’s turn to feel sad. Its hidden stash was actually cheated away by that little thing. It would not have gotten soft on it and given away its hidden stash if it had known this to be the case. It still had to stay here for over half a year. How was it going to survive the days without any snacks?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tiny Mo Xie climbed back onto Chu Mu grumpily and closed its eyes with an unhappy mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without anything to eat, it could only focus on cultivating. It seemed that it was about to break through soon. It would be able to fight stronger enemies after it breaks through, that would be more interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon flapped its wings and it flew back into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Chu Mu was the first to open his eyes. He took a glance at the leaving Martial Cloud Dragon and shut his eyes again to continue his meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after Chu Mu shut his eyes, Xia Yin and Lin Mengling also opened their eyes. They similarly sensed the Martial Cloud Dragon leaving, but they also immediately returned to meditating just like Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps, even they themselves could not believe that they had just stayed together with an Immortal rank Martial Cloud Dragon for a few months and were safe to tell the tale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was certainly an interesting experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Martial Cloud Dragon had left, the three still continued on with their cultivation. It would take them about a year of focused cultivation if they wanted to break through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an unknown amount of time had passed, the three of them suddenly opened their eyes simultaneously!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three took a glance at one another and noticed that everyone felt that something was amiss. Their expressions turned stern immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You two also sensed it?” Xia Yin was the first to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Lin Mengling nodded. Lin Mengling turned to look at the place outside the pot valley and spoke, “A group of powerful creatures are approaching here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vibration of the ground was getting more and more intense as the group of creatures approached. The three of them could even hear various roaring sounds very close to them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a group of soul pets, and they were all very powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, they were running towards the cultivation formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We certainly neglected a very serious problem,” Xia Yin spoke in a serious tone, “This place is constantly gathering Immortal Aura. The Immortal Aura will get denser and denser as time passes. This would definitely attract many Imprint Valley creatures here. They are probably trying to chase us away from here and take this place for themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But why didn’t they do that earlier? We have been cultivating here for over four months now,” Lin Mengling was confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu smiled bitterly, “The Martial Cloud Dragon was sleeping here. Those greedy Imprint Valley creatures didn't dare to come. Now that the Martial Cloud Dragon has left, it’s the same as losing the best guardian. Looks like we will have to face the greedy Imprint Valley creatures for a long time.”</span></p>
