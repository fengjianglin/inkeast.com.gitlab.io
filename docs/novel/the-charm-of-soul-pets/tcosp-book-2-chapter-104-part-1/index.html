 <p><strong>Chapter 104: Inner Darkness, Soul Backlash - 1</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Aohou~~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon appeared, its body was immediately wrapped in countless yellow sandstorms. These powerful sandstorms slammed into Mo Xie’s terrifying royal flame, causing turbulent energy to spread around!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu!!!!! Wu!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon’s power, Mo Xie, who felt provoked, immediately let out a furious call!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon similarly wasn’t the least bit scared of Mo Xie’s massive Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox aura. Its five meter large body violently rolled up a powerful sandstorm, and it heavily dashed towards Mo Xie !!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Sand Dragon Meteor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Guanghan coldly commanded the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon that he was proud of!</span></p>
 <p><span style>By only running, the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon could churn up frightening sandstorms. When it casted techniques, these sandstorms would become even stronger. With the leap of the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon’s body, the permeated sand quickly gathered, making this massive sand dragon a sand mountain. It brought a terrifying, eighth rank power with it as it dived back down!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie, Nine Tail Dragon Obliteration!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Realizing that Mo Xie was threatened by the attack of the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon, Chu Mu didn’t care whether or not if there was a soul pact anymore. He used his remembrance to contain sound, forcefully inserting it into Mo Xie’s mental world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s eyes showed a moment of hesitation. Clearly, after losing their soul pact, the synergy between Chu Mu and Mo Xie had lessened, and she even felt repelled by Chu Mu’s command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Mo Xie still didn’t disobey Chu Mu’s battle commands. Tightly holding onto the ground, the nine imposing tails of hers abruptly extended and waved around like nine dragons behind Mo Xie!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Tail Dragon Obliteration was an ability that could directly blend the enemy’s body into powder but, at this moment, the crazily waving nine tails became the last defensive ability. They slammed into the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon-formed sand meteor with high frequency, quickly peeling through the thick outside layer of the ten meter wide yellow sand mountain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly Flame Rite!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu again compressed his soul remembrance into sound and spoke to Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time Mo Xie didn’t hesitate. She immediately started to step bizarrely to dodge the weakened Yellow Sand Dragon Meteor as her pupils quickly burned with the royal flame made from demon fire evil flames and blood flames!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A flame bundle consisting of an outside layer of crimson demon fire evil flames with an inside layer of bright red fell from the night sky!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment it fell down perpendicularly, a large empty hole appeared in the ground stitched with branches. Within the hole, a spiral flame appeared. The flame leapt upwards. It was dazzling and beautiful- full of a dignified heated aura!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the eighth rank Heavenly Flame Rite swept upwards, the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon abruptly shifted sideways. Though it was massive, its speed was completely not inferior to some demon monarch ranks!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bug type - dragon species soul pets often had terrifying power, extreme agility, powerful defense, resilient life force, and formidable abilities. Almost no soul pet species could compare with this one. Xia Guanghan’s Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon was indeed surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nie!!!! Nie!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Nightmare was completely like a nasty tempered devil. Seeing Mo Xie having trouble with the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon, it actually abandoned the other two soul pets and directly started attacking the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Nightmare fought completely by instinct. This abandoning of the eighth phase sixth stage Dire Wolf and the seventh phase fourth stage Heavenly Vine Demon completely exposed Chu Mu to the weapons of Xia Guanghan’s soul pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Xia Guanghan let go of such a stellar opportunity? He immediately commanded his eighth phase sixth stage Dire Wolf to cast Death Assault straight towards Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hui~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the Dire Wolf jump towards Chu Mu, the Night Thunder Dream Beast immediately gathered a Death Ray and spewed it towards the Dire Wolf. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Guanghan’s strengthened Dire Wolf’s speed was also very surprising. The Night Thunder Dream Beast’s three Death Rays didn’t even hit the Dire Wolf!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shua!!!!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eighth phase sixth stage Dire Wolf extended its sharp claws and viciously swiped them across the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s body. The Night Thunder Dream Beast had already tried to dodge, but the eighth phase sixth stage Dire Wolf’s claw range was immense, creating a shimmering light claw within the dark night as it dragged a long cut on the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s body. At that moment, blood flew out!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Night, Night Dance.” Chu Mu was alarmed. Clearly, the sixth phase fifth stage Night Thunder Dream Beast’s power was still far from the Eighth phase sixth stage empowered Dire Wolf. Chu Mu also let the Night Thunder Dream Beast cast Night Dance, making it hide in the dark night!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwuwu~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie quickly realized that Chu Mu was in danger. With a sweep of her nine gorgeous silver tails, her figure vanished into the night with a “sou”!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Dire Wolf hurt the Night Thunder Dream Beast, it immediately rolled up a wave of bloody scent as it dashed towards Chu Mu. Its long, Dire Wolf claws were already glinting indigo under the moonlight!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dire Wolf’s claws were already at the seventh rank complete stage. Adding on its power and the effects of its technique, a full blown attack was definitely near the eighth rank. Even if Chu Mu casted his soul armor and ice armor, he would probably still be severely injured!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwu!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the Dire Wolf was but five meters away from Chu Mu, Mo Xie’s silver figure brimming with wildness appeared suddenly, crossing splendidly through the Dire Wolf’s path of running. Her long nine tails that dragged behind her abruptly coiled up like a silver tide, completely reeling the Dire Wolf in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nine Tail Flame!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu yelled straight at Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s tail flames suddenly lifted up with two types of devil flame. The nine tails almost instantly ignited the eighth phase sixth stage Dire Wolf’s skin!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Guanghan quickly noticed that his Dire Wolf was controlled by the Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox. Not daring to have any hesitation, he again started an incantation and summoned his fourth soul pet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xia Guanghan cancelled his soul pact with the Earth Fiend Dream Demon, it no longer occupied one of Xia Guanghan’s summoning spots. Additionally, after eating the Soul Healing Stamen, Xia Guanghan’s soul had already slowly healed, so he could still summon another soul pet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep blue devil flames started burning recklessly on Xia Guanghan’s body, causing the entire sky forest to become even more sinister and bleak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Guanghan’s White Nightmare was already at the eighth phase. This battle had already caused a decent shock throughout the sky forest. Once he summoned his eighth phase White Nightmare, even if it intentionally retracted its aura, the Blue Galactic Demon Emperor would definitely appear. Yet, other than the White Nightmare, Xia Guanghan still had a Blue Nightmare!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Blue Nightmare was one of the earliest soul pets that Xia Guanghan owned. In the beginning, he was also chased by this Blue Nightmare, almost having his soul eaten multiple times. However, with the growth of Xia Guanghan, the Blue Nightmare could no longer pose a threat to him, and it became completely obedient to Xia Guanghan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep blue flames started swirling as its powerful cold blue devil fire slowly engulfed the White Nightmare’s powerful soul aura!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Nightmare battling the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon immediately noticed that a Nightmare of its own species had appeared on the battlefield, and it immediately let out an excited devil cry. However, this vile tempered White Nightmare quickly realized its fellow organism’s powerful aura, causing his reckless white devil fire aura to be forcefully subdued!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nie!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the same species, Chu Mu’s White Nightmare exposed its most terrifying side. Yet, this White Nightmare clearly met its match, because the Nightmare Xia Guanghan summoned was an eighth phase first stage Blue Nightmare!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monarch ranked White Nightmare, even after absorbing Chu Mu’s resentment, only reached the seventh phase. The Blue Nightmare of Xia Guanghan, though, had clearly underwent all sorts of type strengthening. The burning blue devil fire on its body was completely different from the other Blue Nightmares that Chu Mu had met before. It was Ghost Devil Fire, which was many times more terrifying than blue devil fire!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the ghost devil fire’s soul burn couldn’t compare with the pale white devil fire of the White Nightmare, it wasn’t far off. Adding on an entire phase difference between the two soul pets, the insolent White Nightmare’s devil fire aura was naturally suppressed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nie!!!! Nie!!!!” The White Nightmare let out a crazed call. Feeling the aura suppression from the Blue Nightmare that owned ghost devil fire, the guy became even less reasonable, starting to cast random white devil fire techniques!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie, go help the white devil.” Chu Mu saw that the White Nightmare had fallen into a predicament and immediately told Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s tail violently whipped, and she directly threw the heavily burnt eighth phase fourth stage Dire Wolf out. Her figure quickly disappeared in spot as she fought her way towards the Blue Nightmare and the Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Guanghan’s Dire Wolf fur had clearly been treated for fire resistance. Under the burn of Mo Xie’s double royal flame, it still didn’t die. After it fell heavily on the floor, it was immediately recalled by Xia Guanghan back into his soul pet space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nie!!!!! Nie!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Nightmare had already vented all its anger towards its same species Blue Nightmare, controlling its white devil fire to slam into the Blue Nightmare’s ghost devil fire. Immediately, the two different cold devil fires lit up the sky forest, causing the entire region to fall into a sea of soul devil fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After fighting her way in, Mo Xie immediately created a massive energy wave in her collision with Xia Guanghan’s Yellow Corpse Sand Dragon. The sweeping of the double royal flame and the roiling of the sandstorm permeated the night sky, causing a huge rumble from time to time, shaking the entire sky forest!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nie!!!!!!!”</span></p>
