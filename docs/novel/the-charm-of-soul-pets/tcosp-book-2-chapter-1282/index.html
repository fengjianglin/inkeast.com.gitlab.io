 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Xiong summoned his feathered demon and shot straight into the black clouds towards Dark Island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Xiong’s feathered demon was a middle class dominator and had recently been strengthened from a xuan item plundered from the city they slaughtered. The feeling of a middle class dominator rank soul pet was completely different. Even if he wasn’t a pirate and lived in a realm city, he could still be a tyrant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for Zhuo Xiong, a middle class dominator rank soul pet was not enough for the things he wanted. In order to increase his strength faster and to obtain more wealth, being a pirate was the best method.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Dark Island was being covered by the dark clouds, Zhuo Xiong was extremely familiar with the path. In the middle of a huge group of clouds, he swooped down and an island only about 20 kilometers in perimeter suddenly appeared in the black sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountains of the island were undulating. The island looked no different from a deserted island, but on the inside of the mountain was hidden a small stronghold. The top of this small city was covered by black clouds and it was impossible to discover this small stronghold even after flying over top.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small stronghold was home to egregious pirates that had terrorized all Crown Ocean ships for a generation! These pirates were all criminals and over half of them were wanted on Wupan Continent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Xiong passed through the mist and through the soul pet trainers defending the skies. He landed right at the center-most building.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leader Zhuo!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the pirates defending the front of the hall saw Zhuo Xiong land, they all saluted him very respectfully.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just tricked a few women to come here from Crown City. That girl from Ocean Sect which you said you wanted…” laughed a pirate to Zhuo Xiong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Xiong waved his hand and said: “I’m not interested right now. I have something I need to speak with big leader with.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ai, what are you in a rush for. That girl is waiting for you right now. It’s not like the navy is coming.” said the pirate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you say another word, I’ll cut your head off!” fiercely said Zhuo Xiong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the pirate saw that Zhuo Xiong was serious, his smile instantly froze. He didn’t dare say anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Xiong passed through the front hall. The system the pirates used was to a certain extent copied from the navy. Although they were a bunch of fish and dragons mixed together, fundamentally, they were very disciplined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the great hall, Zhuo Xiong instantly saw Big Leader Zhuo Qing sitting there. He was currently discussing with a few other pirate chieftains the next city to target, as well as what they would do if they had to evade the navy’s pursuit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Leader, there’s a group of luxurious ships in the nearby ocean region.” Zhuo Xiong walked up and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Zhuo Qing faintly creased his brows. He didn’t like people rudely barging in and speaking nonsense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What luxurious ships?” coldly asked ZHuo Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re boats from New Moon Land. All of their boats are dominator ranks and each boat is worth at least 500 xuan. Just in terms of the boats alone, they’re worth a total of 15 thousand xuan. They also probably have a large amount of resources that they just purchased from Crown City. The waterline of their boats is extremely deep.” said Zhuo Xiong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boats worth 15 thousand xuan!” the eyes of the surrounding chieftains and leaders lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was definitely huge business for them. If they were able to gobble them all up, they could just flee right after plundering. Even if the navy came to chase them, it wasn’t guaranteed they would be able to catch up. Indeed, these were dominator rank ships which were rather fast!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What kind of people are on it?” Zhuo Qing’s expression was still calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are all New Moon Land crew members. They probably have a bit of strength, but we should be able to take them down.” said Zhuo Xiong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does anyone have any information on New Moon Land? Give me the specific details.” Big Leader Zhuo Qing swept his eyes over the 13 chieftains sitting in the great hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Leader, New Moon Land is a great place.” At this point, a pirate chieftain called Old Zhong slowly spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the pirate chieftains looked at him. Most of the pirates obtained their information from this Old Zhong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t I suggest before that we could go to the other side of Dark Ocean?” Chieftain Old Zhong spoke slowly. He would always pause after speaking a sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A few years ago New Moon Land was only a third rank realm. The path there was dangerous and the resources were limited. However, in the recent few years, New Moon Land was able to become independent from Jia Border and subsequently, multiple rich independent spaces with resources have appeared there. The very first soul pets that entered this independent area obtained enormous benefits. Currently, New Moon Land possesses an extremely rich piece of land. Mere description does not do it justice.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Continue.” Zhuo Qing quickly grew interested.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many people say that it is a land of gold because they are surrounded on all four sides by forbidden regions. The resources in these forbidden regions are quite ample. As long as one’s strength is enough, any soul pet trainer can obtain resources there. Added on those rich independent spaces….”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How strong are they?” asked BIg Leader Zhuo Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As larger and organized pirates, they wouldn’t go and gnaw at any piece of meat. They had to ensure they could eat it. They would refuse to do anything which would cause them heavy losses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re very average. Truly very average. Besides a few of their leaders who are very strong, their composite strength is very weak because the people there are from an inferior species. They have extremely few dominators. The status of spirit emperors is very high there. However, they are rapidly developing and it probably won’t be long before they get strong. Indeed, the strength of their leaders cannot be underestimated. With them leading the way…” the pirate called Old Zhong obtained rather comprehensive information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhuo Xiong, around how many people do they have?” asked Big Leader Zhuo Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each boat has around 100 people. So around 3000 in total. I’m unable to ascertain for the time being how strong they are. However, even Old Zhong said that it was originally a third rank realm. Even if it’s developing fast, they can’t be that strong. In my opinion, what they have now is a lot of money!” Zhuo Xiong impassionedly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their mere boats were 15 thousand xuan. This was a significant amount of wealth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Zhuo Qing creased his brows. He thought for a while and hesitated, but he glanced at Old Zhong and said: “Since it’s an independent land, I think that if we were to completely take over New Moon Land…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhuo Qing said this, Zhuo Xiong was stunned. He silently said to himself that it was no wonder the leader was the leader. Leader thought of things much further than he himself did.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, given that New Moon Land was flowing with riches and had such low strength, why didn’t they just take over the place? Nobody was willing to stay a pirate for the rest of their lives. If they could obtain such a huge territory, they could be as tyrannical and abusive as those big realm lords!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Leader, I would suggest that you don’t think about that.” Old Zhong shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? The other chieftains didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ya, why can’t we? Our current strength is no inferior to an eighth rank realm. There’s also Big Leader Zhuo, a peak dominator rank expert. Why can’t we take over a tiny New Moon Land?” asked another young chieftain. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pirate Chieftain Old Zhong bitterly laughed and explained: “First, New Moon Land has been independent for only a few years. Within the ten years, they are still under the protection of Divine Sect. Would you rather us provoke Wupan Navy or Divine Sect?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Second, I heard that there was a person watching over New Moon Land. This person is called Cloud Gate’s old man. Nobody knows his actual name but the rumors have it that he is a Border Lord rank expert.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pirate Old Zhong’s words caused the pirate chieftains to suck in a breath of air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Border Lord expert!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What exactly was a Border Lord?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mere Border Lord was able to annihilate their entire pirate group until not even their dregs were left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past when their Dark Ocean Pirates had encountered an annihilation calamity, it was because they had offended a Border Lord rank expert who nearly destroyed their entire crew. In fact, the Dark Ocean Pirates of then were much stronger than now. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is there such a huge figure there?” Big Leader Zhuo Qing creased his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This subordinate doesn’t know. At the end of the day, we really can’t offend that old man. Also, there are a few leaders of New Moon Land who are extremely strong, especially their king. He alone in the independence fight was able to deal with three border commander rank experts by himself.” said Old Zhong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s his name?” asked the big leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu. He is called King Chu in New Moon Land. After he defeated three lower status Border Commanders, he said something very arrogant.” responded Pirate Old Zhong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did he say?” everyone immediately asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s rumored he said this: ‘New Moon Land is Chu Mu’s territory. Without my permission, no one is allowed to enter this territory. This includes Cloud Realm’s Realm Lord, border territory lord, or Divine Sect High Official… you will be put to death!” said Old Zhong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone immediately looked at each other. Even they, this crew of wild pirates, didn’t dare say these kinds of words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Realm Lord, border territory lord, Divine Sect High Official…. This fellow is quite arrogant. He merely defeated three lower status Border Commanders, yet dares say this. He truly doesn’t know how high the heavens are.” Big Leader Zhuo Qing sneered and a flicker of contempt flashed through his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Big Leader Zhuo, if you summon only one of your main pets, you’ll be able to easily defeat everything he has!!” Old Zhong smartly complimented Zhuo Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if he’s onboard, we’ll kill them all!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Xiong also vigorously nodded his head. His uncle, Zhuo Qing, used to be a high official in the navy and was an upper status ocean commander. A lower status commander with one or two high class dominator rank soul pets was on a completely different level than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since we can’t take over their territory, we’ll just eat up their boats. Such a huge piece of meat has floated over here. Why would we not want it?!” said a pirate chieftain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right! With those 30 dominator rank ships, when attacking cities, we’ll come and go even faster. Perhaps even the navy won’t even be able to see our figure fleet past.” said a female pirate chieftain.&nbsp;</span></p>
