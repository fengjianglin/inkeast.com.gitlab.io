 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since there were so many benefits available there, Chu Mu had to go to the Imprint Valley!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, since Yu Suo used this qualification as the bargaining chip to make him fight against Tang Zhuo, he would have to obtain &nbsp;victory no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“See, I’m being so nice to you, you should not torture me anymore,” Evil Good Queen gave a charming smile to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked away. He was very clear that the Evil Good Queen’s words could not be trusted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu would rather interact with Yu Suo in a business-like manner than to continue speaking with this seductive Evil Good Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t think that I can’t tell what you are thinking about. What is it in the Imprint Valley that you are after?” asked Chu Mu bluntly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu believed that anything that the Evil Good Queen did was to achieve her own objective. She would never supplement the diagram of the Imprint Valley for no reason and fight for a qualification for him without any ulterior motives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master knows me well,” Evil Good Queen giggled softly as she took a step closer to Chu Mu, putting her lips next to his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took a step back to create some distance and broke the mood, “You can use your mental voice to tell me if you don’t want others to hear you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Chu Mu not understand Evil Good Queen’s intentions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The garden could clearly be seen from the window in Ye Qingzi’s room. If Ye Qingzi saw the bewitching Evil Good Queen whispering something to him while sticking so close to him, she would definitely get mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen and Yu Suo were a little different in personalities. Ye Qingzi was not concerned about the relationship between Yu Suo and Chu Mu, but that did not mean that she was fine with the relationship between Evil Good Queen and Chu Mu. Sometimes, she would treat Yu Suo and Evil Good Queen as two completely different individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen trying to seduce Chu Mu at this moment was purely causing trouble for Chu Mu. This woman craved disputes. If she could mess up Chu Mu’s relationships, she might &nbsp;feel even better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speak properly, or I will send you back into the Soul Pet Space,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re so boring,” grumbled Evil Good Queen. Seeing Chu Mu suddenly chanting the Soul Pact Incantation, she was afraid and became serious, “There is a powerful creature in the Imprint Valley. However, it’s power has been suppressed for some reason. This creature’s awareness is hazy, so it’s mind is in a weakened state. If you can lure it into the Soul Capture Flower Formation that I had secretly deployed in the Imprint Valley, it will fall under my control. If we can unleash its suppressed power somehow, then I will obtain a powerful Soul Pet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen’s Soul Capture Flower Formation was similar to the human’s Soul Pact. The creature would become her Soul Pet if it succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The success rate of the Soul Capture Flower Formation was higher, but it was based on seducing the mind. The seduced Soul Pet was prone to betrayal. Evil Good Queen had to specially look after it regularly to gain a better control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, I hope that the Master can help me capture this Soul Pet. The Imprint Valley rejects our evil power. I cannot exert my full strength, you probably cannot transform into half devil, but don’t you have many helpers with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do I feel as if you are the master?” s Chu Mu said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this trip to Zhengming Main City, Yu Suo first asked him to obtain the Northern Territory, then she asked him to subdue a Soul Pet in the Imprint Valley. Was this woman not basically ordering him to do various things for her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of these are my requests to Master, Master has the choice to do them or not. Meanwhile, I would never dare to disobey Master’s orders. Even if you were to ask me to offer you my precious body......” Evil Good Queen peeked at Ye Qingzi’s room and immediately changed her words, purposely acting as if she had accidentally spilled a secret, “These requests are all advantageous to you too, Master. Northern Territory can help New Moon Land develop faster, let alone this Imprint Valley. Also, the Soul Pet that I subdued can be controlled by you as well. It also won’t take up your Soul Pact slot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s expression turned dark immediately. Evil Good Queen was definitely doing this on purpose!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough, I will keep an eye out. Do what you are supposed to do, and don’t come to bother me if you don't have anything important,” Chu Mu waved his hand to send her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen smiled as if she had just succeeded in a prank. Before she left, she spoke with a seductive tone, “If all women bar Master from the room, there is still one room that you can come and go to freely...... Even if you don’t wish to step in right now, it’s fine. We still have a long way to go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of fragrance lingered for a long time. The whispered words echoed next to his ear for a while......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the reason why Chu Mu was so reluctant to interact with Evil good Queen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Yu Suo talked back to him or behaved arrogantly, he could just throw her back into the Soul Pet Space without any hesitation. Even if he would not torture her with the Devil Fire like he did in the past, confining her would also make her suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, faced with the Evil Good Queen’s simple flirting and seduction, what could Chu Mu do against it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the room, Ye Qingzi quietly laid on top of the bed. The thin blanket traced out her alluring curves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had heard every single word that the Evil Good Queen had said. Especially the last line had made her extremely uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ye Qingzi did not get angry. Instead, Evil Good Queen’s words caused her to enter into deep thought, &nbsp;serious deep thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the room, Chu Mu took a glance at the window. He knew that Ye Qingzi had not fallen asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi understood Chu Mu well, it was the same vice versa. Ye Qingzi did not leave and continued to stay in the room. It meant that he had not lost her, now what he had to do was to think of a way to open that door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the imposing Floating Mountain Battlefield, countless young participants were admiring the floating rocks that had a long history. Perhaps, for them, they would have no regrets after fighting a round in such a place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battlefield represented the status of the outstanding experts of the Zhengming Continent. Standing at this place symbolized strength. Every powerful individual had an objective to pursue power. It might be a mission to bring prosperity to their families, or an underestimated individual wanting to prove his worth, or the fervent expectations from acquaintances, or simply to gain a favorable impression from his crush......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they stood on this battlefield, their objectives could be achieved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, only eight individuals were qualified to stand on it. And those eight individuals were all famed for their unparalleled strength. Those with different objectives in mind were mostly sitting on the spectator seats pitifully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The qualification to enter the finals that so many young outstanding experts fought over was very precious. Because, to them, even if they were to lose, losing on the Floating Mountain Battlefield was also a glory in itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, none of the young outstanding experts could have imagined a participant being carefreely added in the finals of such a glorious competition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“First battle, Chu Mu vs Guo Shi!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the main referee announced the match, the entire venue raised a commotion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who is Chu Mu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eight participants had already been confirmed. Why would there suddenly be a new name out of nowhere?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s this? Did the organizer mistake the name? Why is there suddenly a person called Chu Mu?” one Border Lord looked confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I remember that the final eight participants should be Tang Zhuo, Xin Xin, Han Erxing, Lu Fenxue, Gao He, Guo Shi, Mu Yunqing and Shang Xian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s up with the organizer? They even made a simple mistake like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Various comments flew all around the venue. However, once they saw an unfamiliar man walking onto the stage with Guo Shi, they realized that it was not the organizer’s mistake, but that they had really added a participant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main referee used mental voice to tell everyone present, “I have an announcement. Participant Gao He forfeits the competition. In order to ensure that the eight participants can be matched evenly, Chu Mu from New Moon Land will be the replacement participant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commotion became rowdier after the announcement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Replacing a participant without a valid reason would definitely break the rules of the competition. Many people voiced their objections immediately!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were countless young outstanding experts working hard to obtain this qualification. They could not obtain the glory themselves, so there was no way that they could watch some unknown guy suddenly showing up as a replacement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Tang, this replacement isn’t suitable,” Mu Tuan from the Border Lord seats was the first to voice his dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhengming Main City was actually divided into two zones. One belonged to the Divine Sect, Demon Beast Palace, Elemental Clan, Xuan Gate Divine Sect and others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the other zone was the Great Zhengming Border ruled by the Mu Family Dynasty. Amongst the Mu Family’s representatives this time, only Mu Yunqing’s performance was decent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not a strange thing. Since the past, disciples from sects valued individual strength, while the Mu Family Dynasty was known for their military strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This decision will not be rescinded. Old Sect Master, Gate Master Han has already agreed to this,” said Tang Ang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang actually belonged to the Mu Family Dynasty, but his surname was not Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You just allowed him to participate without informing anyone...... As you can see, many people are dissatisfied with this decision. How would the Outstanding Expert Competition hold its absolute authority in future like this?” asked Mu Tuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Elder Tang is a little reckless in doing this,” some mid rank Border Lords also frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang expected such a development and bluntly replied, “Relax, I will convince them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saying so, Tang Ang slowly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, please quieten down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang used his mental voice to suppress all the opposing voices in the venue. In an instant, only Tang Ang’s voice echoed within the entire battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“May I ask if everyone remembers who was the champion of the first Outstanding Expert Competition?” Tang Ang swept his gaze across the entire venue. Seeing that nobody was answering, his gaze turned sorrowful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The champion title of the first Outstanding Expert Competition belongs to a genius called Yue Lei from several centuries ago. At the same time, the Outstanding Expert Competition was organized in the turbulent era using his absolute fame. He was the first champion, as well as the founder of this Outstanding Expert Competition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once that was spoken, the entire venue became even more silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Chu Mu from the New Moon Land standing before all of you, is the disciple of Senior Yue Lei. I know this is not sufficient to convince all of you to let him participate......” reaching this point, Tang Ang paused for a moment, then focused on Chu Mu and raised the corner of his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Within the young generation, whoever is not convinced can take your stand and fight against him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, also there’s no need to do this one by one.”</span></p>
