 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu introduced the others while Lan Rao was still in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She still didn’t understand why Ninth Division’s 3rd Ship Legion’s Big Leader Xu Kuang would be so cordial to Chu Mu. Indeed, Xu Kuang was a peak dominator rank expert and he didn’t need to care about a mere realm lord from a realm under the ninth rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang walked in front and brought Chu Mu and the others into the navy castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should have brought Sang Ying to come look. The navy facilities here are all excellent.” Yuan Sui’s attention was on the northern part of the castle’s features.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, but of course. You seem to be very interested in our navy. How about I take you to take a look around.” said Big Leader Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, you can get one of your subordinates to take me around. King Chu still has something to discuss with you.” said Yuan Sui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu?” Xu Kuang looked a bit confusedly at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The title of king wasn’t something that could be casually thrown around. No realm lord had the qualifications to be called a king.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Leader Xu, he is New Moon Land’s King. Did you not know?” said Lan Rao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang knew who Lan Rao was and when he heard her, he finally understood that Chu Mu was New Moon Land’s king. It was no wonder that he was so strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really couldn’t tell that Brother Chu was already a King.” laughed Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they walked up the large stone bridge into the navy legion castle, there were rows of guards lined up that weren’t moving like statues.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xu Kuang walked in, these guards all saluted. They seemed both dignified and trained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were about to enter the entrance, a man wearing a navy uniform walked up and stopped Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Leader Xu Kuang, there are thirty silver dominator rank warships stopped in the harbor. They call themselves New Moon Navy. Ocean Commander Fang, that idiot, thought they were just a small fleet so he let them pass. But from my investigation, the average strength of this navy legion is at the spirit emperor rank. Isn’t it a bit inappropriate to let this group into our Crown City without questioning them?” quickly said the man wearing a navy uniform.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Navy?” Xu Kuang turned to look at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He remembered Lan Rao had just told him Chu Mu was New Moon Land’s king. Could New Moon Navy be his ship's legion?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those are my ships.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang was stunned. He heard not long ago that a group of ships from outside their realm not inferior to the 5th Ship Legion had entered Crown City. He handed this matter over to Tie Bing to handle. He didn’t expect these ships to belong to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to create such a legion, the strength of one person was far from enough. Xu Kuang realized he had truly underestimated Chu Mu’s capabilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang stepped into the navy waiting room where Leader Hai Tie was already waiting. When Hai Tie saw Chu Mu and Chao Lengchuan, a smile appeared on her face, and she stepped forward to greet them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the room, Chu Mu cut straight to the point and said to Big Leader Xu Kuang: “We came here this time because we want to go into the depths of Wupan territory. Our navy was founded not long ago. One reason for coming was to show our friendly intentions, but the other reason was to train. We’re planning on eliminating the Dark Ocean Pirates.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to eliminate the Dark Ocean Pirates? Brother, if you can help me get rid of the pirates, this would greatly help me.” Big Leader Xu Kuang’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys have so many ships and navy members. Isn’t getting rid of these pirates easy for you?” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, I get angry when I talk about this.” Xu Kuang harrumphed and continued: “There are definitely people from our navy being bribed by the pirates. The moment we mobilize our troops, the pirates will hide without a trace. I won’t hide from you that I just dug out a high ranking navy officer called Zhuo Qing. He was actually the chieftain of the Dark Ocean Pirates, colluding from the inside and harming the citizens of Crown City his entire lifetime. My big brother expelled him from the navy, but when he caught him, Zhuo Qing managed to escape. Not long after he escaped, he slaughtered a city as a demonstration towards us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang got somewhat emotional at this point and grabbed the tea cup beside him and drank it in one gulp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next to him, Hai Qie saw that his emotions weren’t stable and she softly continued: “There are still a few moles inside our navy, so it doesn’t matter how we dispatch our troops, they will still be detected by those Pirates. We have no choice but to issue a bounty to suppress the pirates. However, individual soul pet trainers without any organization can only catch a small portion of the pirates. They aren’t able to touch the core of the pirates.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. These pirates definitely had an information network having been in Crown Ocean for so long. They weren’t afraid of outside enemies, only afraid of traitors.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the navy was indeed disciplined and strict, there would still inevitably be a few moles. Especially when these moles could be of higher status, the navy would be even more handcuffed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I came here to collect some information on the pirates. I would presume that you have quite a bit given your interactions over the number of years.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This shouldn’t be a problem. As long as you are able to eliminate the pirates, that will greatly help our Ninth Division Ship Legions. How many navy members do you have and how strong are they?” asked Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have 3000 navy members and the average strength is middle class emperor. We have 100 dominator rank experts and two high class dominator ranks. We will also participate in the pirate elimination.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If that’s all you have, you might suffer a few setbacks when facing the pirates. But since you’re personally taking action, the problems are going to be a lot easier.” Xu Kuang nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang was very certain of Chu Mu’s strength. Indeed, the 3rd Ship Legion had nearly completely fallen on Yellow Springs Path, while Chu Mu possessed a soul pet that could defeat Forgotten River as well as Yellow Springs which had even more terrifying power. This was enough to eliminate the pirates.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Also, we inadvertently discovered the main base of the pirates.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Main base? Where?” immediately asked Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On an island near our New Moon Land.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So they went there to hide… no wonder we weren’t able to find it!” Xu Kuang gritted his teeth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would need New Moon Navy to take action and eliminate the pirates because Wupan navy was being closely watched. The moment they took action, all the pirates would go hide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each Dark Ocean Pirate member’s head is worth 1 xuan, the leader of a small team is worth about 10 xuan, the leader of a big team is worth about 100 xuan and the leaders of the pirates are worth anywhere from 100 to 1000 xuan. When the time comes, I’ll find the corresponding bounty and pay you the amount. The leaders of the pirates are pretty much all famous. As for the chieftain of the pirates, they’re worth anywhere from 1000 xuan to 10,000 xuan. I’ll give you as much as the bounty says. Finally, there’s Zhuo Qing who has a bounty of 30,000 xuan. If you can capture him, besides the bounty, our navy will reward you with an additional 10,000 xuan. Additionally, if you manage to help us eliminate them, I can propose an alliance with your navy to our administration. This way, your New Moon Navy will be able to stop in any port city under the jurisdiction of our Ninth Division. You also won’t be charged an anchoring or entering fee.” Hai Qie immediately told them about the rewards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, what a huge amount.” When Chao Lengchuan finished listening, he smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was no small amount. New Moon Land was in the process of developing. The more capital they acquired, the better. There was no reason not to accept this amount.&nbsp;</span></p>

The earlier we get rid of those dogs the better.” said Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She has grievances with those pirates?” Chu Mu was able to see something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she had heard him talk about eliminating the pirates, Hai Qie’s eyes had looked a bit strange, as if she was impatient.&nbsp;</span></p>

Her two older brothers then joined the navy. Although they killed many Dark Ocean Pirates, they both ultimately died under the blade of those pirates.” said Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t realize Leader Hai’s life was so tragic. It was no wonder she was like that when you told her to come with us.” said Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>

But most people in our navy legion are able to see that her mind is filled with killing the Dark Ocean Pirates. I hope this time you’re able to succeed. &nbsp;This way, she’ll be able to resolve the matter eating away at her mind. At least she won’t have to go by herself every year during monsoon city to the ocean graves and cry.” faintly said Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The ocean greaves you’re talking about are Wan City’s ocean graves?” asked Lan Rao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, you’ve been?” Xu Kuang raised her brows.&nbsp;</span></p>

That place is his home. I’ve probably seen her a few times then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He Cang. He’s an incredible person.” Xu Kuang stroked his beard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is this He Cang?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>

They wantonly slaughtered there. It was an extremely serious morally desecrating slaughter. The number of people killed were countless and they included Hai Qie’s mother and father. He Cang is an expert from Wan City. When he learned his home had been slaughtered, he led a group of experts who were following him to fight against the Dark Ocean Pirates of the past. He crushed the Dark Ocean Pirates… that period of time was when the Dark Ocean Pirates were the most rampant and their total strength was comparable to our NInth Division’s 1st Ship Legion. However, He Cang, relying on his individual strength as well as the group of powerful followers, managed to kill the Pirate Chieftain of that time. He also destroyed countless pirate islands and completely defeated them…”&nbsp;</span></p>
