 <p>“Nine Ghosts Shen, is your Ghost Blood Diagram finished?!” impatiently yelled Xu Lu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xu Lu hurrying Nine Ghosts Shen meant that he was feeling uneasy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even with seven of them there, a few of them had been instakilled. These five people, although strong, if any one of them were killed, the remaining would be slaughtered without any chance to fight back.</p>
 <p>Nine Ghosts Shen returned to his senses and glanced at his five Blood Ghosts. He noticed how they were almost about to finish their incantations and hastily used a mental voice to say: “Just a little bit more. Don’t let it get to me, otherwise everyone will die!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Elemental Sect’s Guo Enlong and Ocean Lord Xue Yingfeng had already ordered their soul pets to attack Chu Mu in order to buy time for Nine Ghosts Shen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ve finished. But it’s moving too fast. My Great Ghost Blood Diagram might not be able to fully seal it as it’s being released. We need to lure it into the center of the formation.” Nine Ghosts Shen used a mental voice to tell the others.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Xu Kuan, use your Light’s Fury as bait.” Xu Lu ordered Xu Kuan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan would always listen to his older brother, Xu Kuan. Even when his life was in danger, he didn’t hesitate. He ordered his Light’s Fury to fly into the center of the Great Ghost Blood Formation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Light’s Fury was an elemental soul pet. Its light type techniques posed no small threat to the dark type Nightmares. If it weren’t for the Light’s Fury earlier, Third White wouldn’t have been suppressed so quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right now, the Light’s Fury had run to a location where it was nearly exposed and invested itself in chanting an incantation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, Xu Lu’s Light Emperor, Guo Enlong’s Unifying Wind Unicorn, and Xue Yingfeng’s Python Tail Blue Lion had intentionally slowed their offensive tempo, exposing the gap to Chu Mu!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu instantly saw the Light’s Fury which was almost completely defenseless. He glanced at the three immortal rank soul pets surrounding him and a cold smile rose on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He took a step forth and his body easily passed by the three immortal rank soul pets, mysteriously appearing in front of the Light’s Fury.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The black and white devil was fast. In fact, Xu Lu was certain that even if they didn’t slow their attacks, it would still be able to easily reach the Light’s Fury.</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan saw that the devil had appeared in front of his Light’s Fury. Although he had prepared his heart for this, he still felt a bitter knot there.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Light Fantasy!” Xu Kuan ordered his Light’s Fury.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The incantation the Light’s Fury had been chanting just now wasn’t to attack the dual evil devil. Instead, while standing in the Great Ghost Blood Formation, it had been chanting a fleeing incantation. The moment the dual evil devil appeared, the Light’s Fury would immediately flee!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Flashes of light erratically appeared and the Light’s Fury seized this to flee in all directions!</p>
 <p>In Chu Mu’s silver eyes, the Light’s Fury’s series of incantations and fleeing movements were incomparably slow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In fact, he had already predicted it would immediately flee. Thus, the moment it began chanting the fleeing incantation, Chu Mu had prepared a dark prison for the Light’s Fury.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Dual Evil Mound!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The flames burning in Chu Mu’s hands fiercely slapped the earth!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After transforming into a black and white dual evil devil, the speed at which Chu Mu released Evil Mound was much faster now. He would normally require a few seconds to prepare the technique in order to fully exhibit its might. But now, the technique could be instantly completed!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An enormous evil mound began hovering over Chu Mu’s head. Different from the previous dark evil mound iterations, the evil mound this time was divided into black and white.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A shadow covered over the Light’s Fury, and the moment it moved, the stunning dual evil mound descended, imprisoning it inside!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Beng!!!!”</p>
 <p>The instant the evil mound descended, devil flames began to sweep out from the evil mound, transforming the barren land into a black and silver devil flame ocean!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The violent devil flames roared in Xu Kuan’s face. Xu Kuan didn’t expect his Light’s Fury to be unable to flee, and as he looked at the enormous evil mound, he was frozen in place.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hurry… hurry and save my Light’s Fury!” Xu Kuan shouted in panic.</p>
 <p>Even the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon, with the tenacious life force of a dragon, had been instantly killed. How many seconds would his Light’s Fury be able to survive under the devilish claws of this dual evil devil?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the Light’s Fury and Chu Mu were simultaneously covered by the evil mound, Xu Kuan felt as if he had descended into unknown darkness. His entire body and even soul was cold!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nine Ghosts Shen didn’t really know what to do. If he were to activate the Great Ghost Blood Formation, the Light’s Fury and black and white evil devil would both be sealed. But it was obvious what kind of end the Light’s Fury would meet if it were stuck with the terrifying devil inside a sealed space!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In front of the dual evil devil, their powerful immortal rank creatures would be rendered into sheep that could be slaughtered at will!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nine Ghosts Shen, what are you just standing there for?! Hurry and activate the Great Ghosts Blood Formation!” roared Xu Lu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Big brother, my Light’s Fury is still inside!” shouted Xu Kuan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Light Emperor, Unifying Wind Unicorn, and Python Tail Blue Lion were the strongest. From their current locations, they would be unable save the Light’s Unicorn in time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nine Ghosts Shen!” Xu Lu ignored Xu Kuan and roared with an ordering tone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even Xu Lu did not hesitate to sacrifice Xu Kuan’s soul pets. How could Nine Ghosts Shen have time for pity? If he missed this opportunity, it would be extremely difficult to seal this dark devil!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pu pu pu~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>The fresh blood path was laid out, passing through the scorched black earth and forming a “厉” pattern.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The blood path rose up into the sky, drawing an enormous ghost blood formation, dripping with blood, above Chu Mu’s dual evil mound.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It had a striking red color, a fierce design, and a violent blood fiend ghost aura!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Departed Spirit Palace Shen Bu’s five strongest blood ghosts appeared on the blood path laid out. They opened their fierce mouths and continuously spat out blood towards the Ghost Blood Diagram in the sky, making the bloody design even more striking!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The thick blood that the five ghosts were spitting out had been gathered by Shen Bu from living bodies when he normally engaged in slaughter. If all of the blood were to be spat out from the five ghosts, it was capable of filling a dried-up river!!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The five ghosts had used up one-third of the fresh blood when they had sealed the Black Nightmare earlier. This one third had taken Shen Bu three years and thousands of lives to collect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But this dual evil devil was even more tyrannically strong than the Black Nightmare. Under the threat of death, NIne Ghosts Shen didn’t dare be stingy with the blood stored within the five ghosts. He had the ghosts spit the remaining two-thirds of blood into the Great Ghost Blood Diagram to ensure the dual evil devil would be thoroughly sealed!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My… my Light… My Light’s Fury…” Xu Kuan stared with wide eyes at the completion of the Great Ghost Blood Formation. He looked like he had lost his soul.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once the Great Ghost Blood Formation finished sealing, Xu Kuan’s Light’s Fury wouldn’t have any chance left of surviving.</p>
 <p>“E!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a miserable hair-raising cry rang out from the Great Ghost Blood Formation and the dual evil mound. It came from the Light’s Fury. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sharp cry of extreme pain made the other four involuntarily tremble. Because they couldn’t see the miserable state the Light’s Fury was in inside the dark evil mound, they felt more scared.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If it had been one of them whose soul pets had acted as bait, they would find it extremely difficult to watch their immortal rank soul pets, that they had painstakingly raised, be ripped apart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Indeed, Xu Kuan had already powerlessly sat on the ground. His face was terrifyingly pale.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Losing his immortal rank Light’s Fury was the same as him being killed!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hmph, it’s just a soul pet. Once we obtain the Messiah Tree Seed, you’ll have as many immortal rank soul pets as you want. Sacrificing a bit is nothing!” Xu Lu glanced at Xu Kuan and berated him for not understanding.</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan looked up with a pained expression at his older brother, Xu Lu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan’s confidence in Xu Lu contained no traces of doubt. Even if he wanted his Light’s Fury to become bait, he wouldn’t hesitate at all.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, when his older brother had ordered Nine Ghosts Shen to activate the Great Ghost Blood Formation, his eyes contained no trace of disturbance. It was a form of ruthlessness that made Xu Kuan even feel terrified.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan really wanted to know if it had been him and his Light’s Fury standing together, imprisoned by the dual evil devil, whether Xu Lu would still not bat an eye and have Nine Ghosts Shen activate the ghost blood seal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite following Xu Lu for so many years, this was the first time Xu Kuan felt how terrifying Xu Lu actually was.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nine Ghosts Shen, how long will your Great Ghost Blood Formation last for? How much of its life force can it consume?” asked Ocean Lord Xu Yingfeng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Now that the dual evil devil had been sealed, this was the best opportunity for the five of them to flee. If they all fled in different directions, the dual evil devil would only be able to chase one of them once it broke through the seal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ocean Lord Xue Yingfeng’s question was to understand whether the seal would give them enough time to flee.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of the spirit dominator rank experts they had brought had been burned to ashes by the flames and three immortal rank soul pets had died. Thus, realistically speaking, not a single one of them would be without lingering fear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I used two-thirds of the sealed blood I spent ten years accumulating. I’m not sure how long it will be able to seal it for…” Nine Ghosts Shen let out a sigh of relief and a mocking smile rose on his face as he continued, “But I’m sure a large amount of its life force will be removed. According to my estimations, it doesn’t matter how long the seal lasts, its strength will be weakened to less than 40 percent of its original power. It could even be lower!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Are you for real?” said Elemental Sect's Guo Enlong.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course. The life force of the Black Nightmare earlier was removed by my Great Ghost Blood Diagram.” said Nine Ghosts Shen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeing was always going to be the last resort. Nobody could guarantee they wouldn’t become the target of pursuit. Moreover, they had suffered horrible losses this time. If they didn’t obtain the Messiah Tree Seed, they wouldn’t be able to explain it to their superiors. Most importantly, they had caused a massive scene. Thus, the righteous factions with Divine Sect at the head would definitely punish them. Without the protection of their superiors, they would die!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nine Ghosts Shen’s five ghosts seal is famous everywhere. There won’t be any mistakes. However, we shouldn’t lower our guard. Heal up your soul pets and prepare at any moment to slaughter the dual evil devil once the seal disappears!” Xu Lu had already witnessed Nine Ghost’s Shen’s five ghosts seal in the past, so he was very confident in Nine Ghosts Shen. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the end, the greed of these five people had defeated the fear they had towards the dual evil devil.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once they killed the dual evil devil, they would be able to obtain the Messiah Tree Seed. Such an enormous profit and an enormous amount of power was in front of them. Why would they be willing to turn and leave and surrender it?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, none of them knew whether their choice would allow them to soar into the air and arrogantly laugh at the world, or whether their greed would be burned with them as they were forever buried here alongside the other invaders.&nbsp;</p>
