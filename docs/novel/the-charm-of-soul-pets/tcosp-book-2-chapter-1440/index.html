 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re in a bad mood?” Evil Good Flower Queen asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the existence of a soul pact, Evil Good Queen could feel Chu Mu’s emotions. The anger was boiling forth, pushing him towards insanity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen glanced below here. There was quite a bit of ash and bloody corpses. She also saw the scene of Chu Mu killing Gu Xisha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Evil Good Flower Queen’s first time seeing Chu Mu become half devil in a while. The black white devil flames indeed were a strong visual shock. It was as if a devil god from another dimension had descended upon this world, one that didn’t fit in but was nevertheless madly arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t reply to Evil Good Queen. However, Evil Good Queen simply went through their soul pact and read through Chu Mu’s memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen checked incredibly quickly. However, before Chu Mu could resist or get angry, she already got what she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s why.” Evil Good Queen retracted her alluring smile and pointed at Sect Master Du, “I didn’t tell you before, but the reason Imprint Valley collapsed was because of him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu glanced at Evil Good Queen to wait for her to continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow’s habit is collecting the blood essence of powerful organisms with high blood lineages and then injecting this blood essence into another species to create the perfect soul pet. There are quite a few powerful and strong lineage organisms in Imprint Valley, so he started destroying the spatial structure long ago….” Evil Good Queen said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen entered Zhengming Main City, Imprint Valley had already been wasted for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t deteriorating for no reason. Sect Master Du was forcefully destroying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen entered Imprint Valley many times and noticed this long ago. However, she at first didn’t know who was destroying Imprint Valley. Or rather, she didn’t know who stole the initiative from her to do something with the Imprint valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sect Master Du heard Evil Good Queen’s words. Most half humans were no different from humans. In fact, Sect Master Du knew clearly that half humans were usually humans, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that they lived similar lives as humans, but he didn’t expect it to know of his plans of destroying IMprint valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sect Master Du stared at Evil Good Queen and carefully gazed at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Flower Queen able to appear here in such a short time meant that it was definitely in Zhengming Main City. Sect Master Du tried to guess from this woman’s aura and characteristics just who it could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sadly, Sect master Du scoured his memories but still couldn’t find anyone even close to similar to this evil beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really know quite a bit.” Sect Master Du smiled. “However, you should know that my interest for you two far exceeds the Imprint Valley organisms. Bringing you two out, is it just my luck?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sect Master Du had a very righteous appearance with a sturdy nose and thick brows. When he laughs, it also emanates a sense of justice. If someone saw his current zeal, who would expect that Sect Master Du, a person at the tip of the human world, had such a greedy side?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Human leaders were no longer wavered by money or power. Their power was also at a peak. No one would believe that a Divine Sect Sub Sect Master would create a plot to destroy a world just to collect more high blood lineages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he did far more than that. The sacred blood of the Messiah Tree was hidden in his basement as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only time the righteous Divine Sect chose to comply was when they decided not to hunt down the criminals in Quiet Forest. This was one because it related many leader rank experts, but also because the Vice Sect Master Du Xian was also a participant. As Vice Sect Master, the only person able to judge him was himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xian never thought those actions were against Divine Sect. In fact, he always thought he was doing the best he could. The human realm needs an Undying rank expert. They needed the highest belief to unify the scattered human race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect wasn’t a belief of humanity; it was only a judgment. Du Xian has been an arbiter for hundreds of years. Evil people who have died by his hands were in the tens of thousands. He had also stopped countless calamities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was tired. He was tired of this constant struggle, tired of trying to stop the endless criminals and evil-doers, tired of these humans who easily fell down a faulty path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to become a unifying faith, just as how the Five Great Undying Legends were like gods within their species. Only at a rank like that can he use his power to create commandments for humanity. Only then can the continuation of humans be well structured. He would also become the sole leader and bring humanity through an unprecedented golden age!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His thoughts were insane, but he had a chance of success because he was already one of the leaders of humanity. He was one of the four sect masters of Divine Sect, and he had the horn of the Empyrean Dragon that represented divine rights. He had the blood of the father of the world, Messiah Tree. He had half of the Hidden Pupil Royalty’s support. He also had countless high ranking organisms within Imprint Valley as his pawns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xian knew that many people were suspicious when he had destroyed Imprint Valley. Even some inner members of Divine Sect had this suspicion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, how could they guess that the destruction of Imprint Valley was just one part of his plan? Even if someone found out, who could stop him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you two are willing to be loyal to me, everything you want, I can give you.” Du Xian pointed to Chu Mu and Evil Good Queen and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans could never step into Undying rank, but how about special lineage half-humans?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xian felt that Half Humans could likely be a breakthrough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen looked at Du Xian with interest. She knew what Du Xian was thinking about because Evil Good Queen saw the same ambition and zeal in his eyes as her own heart. This man didn’t want to just be the highest arbiter of Divine Sect. He wanted to rule the human race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry, but I am loyal to someone else already.” Evil Good Queen’s voice suddenly became soft and seductive, her beautiful eyes flashing with a mysterious glint. One couldn’t tell if she was telling the truth or lying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who? Who are you loyal to?” Du Xian was slightly sensitive. Knowing that these two half humans already were loyal to someone, he immediately roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen extended a thin finger at Chu Mu and said, “Can’t you tell that I’m just a small flower slave that he can control however he wants?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xuan’s face twitched. This Flower Queen was trying to mock him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Du Xian’s eyes fell on Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black and white, the devil man with two colored flames indeed had the power to match its unwordly pride. Even in all species, he was a king that no one could match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xian retracted his anger. He didn’t care at all about telling his wild ambitions to these two half-humans…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu also gazed at Du Xian, his anger welling up even stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the criminal of Quiet Forest. This anger already caused Chu Mu to be infuriated with this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only having seen the cruelty of Quiet Forest, having seen Ning Maner’s heart-wrenching cries, witnessed countless protectors giving up their lives in protection, only then could one truly understand just how heartless and unforgivable the criminals of Quiet Forest were!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Imprint Valley too. Chu Mu always thought that Imprint Valley fell because the world couldn’t handle its own energy. When he saw the Seven Sin Fox Light King hugging and waiting for death, Chu Mu could only choose to leave silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Skies fell, all organisms died. Chu Mu has killed countless lives in his time, but even he couldn’t help quell the tidal waves going through his heart when he saw entire species disappear into a black hole!!</span></p>
