 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu continued to rest with his eyes closed. They only looked alike; he wouldn’t have any thoughts towards her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao saw that he wasn’t talking, but was happy about this. She hated having to interact with these people. If it weren’t for the fact they were here for an important affair, she would have fiercely taught those young masters who wanted to take advantage of her a lesson.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, Xiao Huan, where are the two guests from just now?” suddenly, Xiao Xiao discovered something and hastily asked a question to the girl who was attending to Chu Mu earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, they went downstairs. I think they’ve already left.” said the girl called Xiao Huan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?! Didn’t I tell you to watch over them?!” Xiao Xiao’s voice suddenly turned strict.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Huan jumped in fright and gaped with her mouth open for a long while before saying: “I… I forgot.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You couldn’t even do something so small. Do you know where they went?!” angrily and hurriedly said Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I… I don’t know.” said Xiao Huan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… you… you really piss me off. What on earth do you have on your mind? Is it filled up with mush?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao rolled her eyes. She had just left for a short while and had told Xiao Huan to look over these two extremely suspicious men. Yet, Xiao Huan had let them slip away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had spent a huge amount of effort in order to find their trail. But now they had slipped back into the sea of people; how would she be able to find them now?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao’s chest was heaving while Chu Mu was watching with wide eyes. It wasn’t that Chu Mu was curious about these two men. Instead, Xiao Xiao’s voice was too loud. Chu Mu had just been thinking that her temperament was very similar to Ye Qingzi’s mild temperament. Indeed, when he was closing his eyes to rest, his mind was filled with Ye Qingzi’s soft-as-water-ness. But this woman then proceeded to begin rebuking someone else, completely destroying Chu Mu’s reflection, and his initial sense of this woman called Xiao Xiao. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How was this woman simple and elegant? Her temper was too explosive! Just now she had seemed natural and relaxed, but the moment she heard those two men had left, she instantly exploded into a fit of angry criticism.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was fine. Chu Mu was certain that this woman’s temperament and personality were completely different than Ye Qingzi. Ye Qingzi was the sort of person that even when mad, wouldn’t angrily yell. Instead, she would get scarily cold…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know where they went.” Chu Mu spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You know? Where did they go? Hurry and tell me!” hastily said Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu forced a smile and shook his head. It turned out that woman’s refined appearance just now had been an act.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu was curious why Xiao Xiao was so interested in those two men. From her present appearance and expression, she probably didn’t know those two men; instead, it was like she had lost the prey she was hunting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are in Guang Feng Back Alley. When they left just now I heard them mention this.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it wasn’t because she looked a bit like Ye Qingzi, Chu Mu couldn’t have been bothered to pay attention to her matters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, oh. Thank you. Please take your time trying the tea. I have something so I must leave first.” hurriedly said Xiao Xiao. She then urgently left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu helplessly watched this hurried woman and forced a smile as he shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A while after Xiao Xiao had left, the woman called Xiao Huan finally took over her spot and came up to pour tea for Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Huan wasn’t good at coveresing. But as she sat there at a loss next to Chu Mu, she would occasionally examine Chu Mu who was resting with his eyes closed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unknown amount of time later, the appraisal master came back. He walked up to Chu Mu with a face full of smiles and politely bowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man had to have extremely high status in order to be so wealthy in resources. It was thus very normal for him to bow to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve finished our appraisal. Inside your spatial ring there’s a total of…” the appraisal master was about to tell him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu waved his hand and interrupted him: “I know how many items there are inside. Just tell me their price.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh… oh, ok.” the appraisal master had never seen such a frank person before, especially in the face of such a huge sum of resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The price we’ll give you for all of the resources in your spatial ring is 70 thousand xuan.” politely said the appraisal master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“70 thousand xuan?” Chu Mu faintly creased his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li had estimated the value of the items was around 80 thousand. But when he got to the auction hall, the price was an entire 10 thousand xuan lower. Indeed, although the speed of exchange here was fast, it was too shady. 10 thousand xuan could purchase a normal quality seventh rank xuan item.If his luck was good, that was a high class dominator rank!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh… I haven’t finished talking yet. Considering the fact you’re selling such a huge amount of xuan items at once, and are willing to sell it all to our Luan City, we’ll raise the price of these xuan items. This is our auction’s respect towards a mighty soul pet trainer like you. Therefore, we’ll sell it for 75 thousand xuan. Are you willing to accept this price?” the appraisal master reacted very quickly and practically spoke this the moment Chu Mu creased his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, their Luan City’s exchange price was 70 thousand xuan because they had to obtain profits. Moreover, they would aggressively seek profits. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in order to not offend experts, they would never make the prices too unreasonable. Therefore, this man started with 70 thousand to test the waters. If the other party was dissatisfied, he would immediately say the rest to ease the atmosphere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, 75 thousand xuan is about the right price. If you sell it in the exchange, you’ll inevitably take a loss since they also need to find a suitable purchaser.” Old Li’s voice drifted out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu felt pained from losing 5000 xuan for no reason. However, it was also his fault of preferring to save time…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had previously not wanted to sell the xuan items he collected for this reason. If he sold them elsewhere, even if he received the price from an auction, it wouldn’t necessarily be the best price. The best value he could receive was from using it himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. He would just have to sell it for 75 thousand. As for how much of a profit the auction could make through auctioning these items, that was their matter. Not all of these xuan items were pure strengthening xuan items. Many of them were materials and crystals that supplemented strength. These items may even go months before being sold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Huan, send this master back to where he lives.” after they finished their exchange, the appraisal master immediately faintly smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? Yes…” Xiao Huan was stunned and for a moment didn’t know what to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they exited the auction, Xiao Huan followed behind Chu Mu. Chu Mu was silently bewildered. It was fine for her just to send him outside the exchange. Was there really a need to send him back to where he lived?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then, Old Li suddenly craftily laughed and said: “Young master, this girl seems to be an extra benefit from the exchange. Although you lost 5000 xuan, you got a woman. Hehe, truly tactful. Send him back to where he lives…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s face immediately darkened. It was no wonder the appraisal master threw him a profound smile when he left. He was giving him a hidden meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">75 thousand xuan on top of a pure woman for a night. Even if Chu Mu felt he took a loss in terms of the price, 5000 xuan was definitely a price many female soul pet trainers under the low class dominator rank were willing to sell their body for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, although this lady Xiao Huan was good looking, she seemed a bit ordinary. If it were Xiao Xiao, Chu Mu would perhaps think longer about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did the lady called Xiao Xiao want you to watch those two men?” Chu Mu was suddenly curious about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I… I don’t know either. Big Sister Xiao Xiao wanted me to watch them the moment they started exchanging. I think Big Sister Xiao is peeved at them for something.” said Xiao&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Peeved at them? Why would you say that?” asked Chu Mu. From what Chu Mu saw, he didn’t think the lady called Xiao Xiao knew those two men.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because I heard those two men say once that they wanted to lure Big Sister Xiao out and play with her.” said Xiao Huan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Huan’s words stunned Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coming from a man’s mouth, wasn’t playing with her a bit vile?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That can’t be right!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu suddenly thought of a serious problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Xiao Xiao had followed these two men in secret, then from what Xiao Huan had said, those two men could likely have already detected her. Their going to Guang Feng Back Alley could be to intentionally lure XIao Xiao out. And perhaps those men had said all that when they walked by him for Xiao Huan to here and so that Xiao Huan could pass it on to Xiao Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lady Xiao Huan had been a bit muddleheaded and hadn’t heard what they said. This should have allowed Xiao Xiao to avoid this danger, but he ended up saying to much and telling the lady called Xiao Xiao that they went to Guang Feng Back Alley…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is Xiao Guang Back Alley?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a gem tower on the northern end of Gem Street to the eastern side of the central district of the city. It will be easy to see it from there.” responded Xiao Huan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you go back. I have something else I need to do.” Chu Mu chanted an incantation and immediately summoned Night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? You want me to go back?” said Xiao Huan with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before she had finished speaking, Chu Mu had already flew off in a certain direction on Night. He left Xiao Huan standing stunned in the crowd of people. It was a long time before she came back to her senses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Huan had just spent most of the time just now thinking what she would do once she arrived at this handsome young master’s residence. If he dragged her into his room to do some embarrassing things, would she reject him or…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as she was wrestling with this problem in her head, Chu Mu shot off on Night leaving behind a beautiful image from the back, dispelling these disorderly thoughts in her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the night, even the sky was part of Night’s path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under its feet the city was ablaze with lights. Night was like a brilliantly black shooting star streaking across the city sky. It was moving extremely fast and those patrolling guards that prohibiting aerial travel weren’t able to discover Night’s existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was flying straight to Guang Feng Back Alley.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a woman who looked like his wife ended up sending herself into the mouths of two wolves because of what he happened to coincidentally say, if anything happened after, it would prevent that man from sleeping an entire night!&nbsp;</span></p>
