 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shyly opening her eyes, Princess Jin Rou found that Chu Mu’s face was extremely close to her. At this distance, Princess Jin Rou could already see the reflection of herself in Chu Mu’s pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though she couldn’t feel anything, it was the first time Chu Mu was this close to her. Her mind went blank, and her heart was thrown into chaos. All her courage and pride disappeared, leaving only a frightened little deer left. She didn’t even know where to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a moment, she recovered from her panic, but couldn’t help but feel sad for her ghostly body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn’t even touch him, yet she was already like this. If she could touch his lips, what would it feel like?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least Chu Mu was experienced in such matters. However, Princess Jin Rou was still pure and untainted. She had never had any experiences of intimate contact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will find the Limbo Flower.” Chu Mu repeated himself. However, compared to the past, Chu Mu’s words were much more firm this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“En.” Princess Jin Rou nodded heavily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Territory Conference happened once every ten years. However, what they discussed was something Liu Binglan didn’t know about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan wanted to get more news from other territories but sadly, New Moon Land had never communicated with anyone who truly had the qualifications to attend this conference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu told Liu Binglan not to worry too much about it and just go. After all, New Moon Ground had gathered many dominator rank experts already. Adding on the almost immortal rank Bai Yu, who was even more diligent than the workaholic Chu Mu, New Moon Land’s position was a far cry from what it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What, Jinrou isn’t going with us?” Liu Binglan quickly found that the team going to Zhengming Continent didn’t include Princess Jin Rou and asked questioningly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She and Uncle Bai Yu went to the sky forest to look for clues of the Limbo Flower and to also see the Heaven Boundary Monument there.” Chu Mu explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I thought you made her angry.” Liu BInglan laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan’s eyes never missed a detail. She noticed that, in recent times, Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou had been together for longer, and clearly were conveying different emotions in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t care about other peoples’ personal matters, but with Chu Mu, she was incredibly observant. Any small change couldn’t escape Liu Binglan’s eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Liu Binglan has been thinking these past few nights. With Chu Mu’s personality, he would definitely bring it up to Ye Qingzi. How would she comfort Ye Qingzi when the time came?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu noticed Liu Binglan’s expression was strange. After her beating around the bush for a while, Chu Mu was rolling his eyes in exasperation. Could his mother not be this inquisitive about his personal matters and just remain the cold beauty she was?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, there were eight people going to Zhenming Main City: Liu Binglan, Chao Lengchuan, Ye Wansheng, Ning Maner, Shen Mo, Pang Yue, and a middle-aged man that Liu Binglan called “Yu Bo”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Bo’s identity was a mystery, but he was extremely powerful- so powerful that even Chu Mu couldn’t get a real estimate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Bo appearing in New Moon Ground was indeed strange. He probably was a soul pet trainer that wanted to live privately. Hearing that New Moon Land was an independent place and was relatively far away, he chose it as his resting ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Yu Bo didn’t expect to meet an old friend of his here, Cloud Gate Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Yu Bo and the Cloud Gate Elder’s age were an unknown number. Yet, after they met in a heartwarming fashion, they talked about their past with centuries as the basic unit of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being able to find a close friend while retiring was a rare event. Thus, Yu Bo decided to take root in Wanxiang City and occasionally played chess and drank tea with Cloud Gate Elder, having the time of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Gate Elder had already decided to stay in New Moon land. Yu Bo, as a retiree, also didn’t do anything. After he saw Liu Binglan and saw her special purple pupils, he recommended himself as the Sacred Guard Dlder for Female Supreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Gate Elder was very surprised that Yu Bo was willing to become a Sacred Guard Elder. Liu Binglan didn’t know Yu Bo’s background, but since he was Cloud Gate Elder’s old friend, he was naturally trustworthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Binglan asked the Cloud Gate Elder of Yu Bo’s strength and background, Cloud Gate Elder shook his head, “You have to know that, ever since I lost to one person, I’ve sworn to protect Cloud Gate. I don’t even know how many years it has been. Little Yu is an expert with extreme potential that I met before I lost. At the time, he was merely slightly weaker than me. After this many years, even I don’t know how high he has managed to climb. Even if he lost some strength due to age and decided to retire, he still is far superior to any nameless folk in Zhenming Continent. If he goes with you to Zhenming Main City, your safety will be guaranteed. It’s likely that many famous and powerful people in Zhenming Continent are generations younger than him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu BInglan knew that Cloud Gate Elder never lied, so she continued to call this friend Yu Bo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such an experienced expert along with them, she indeed could worry less.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, everyone was naturally curious about this mysterious retired Yu Bo. Ye Wansheng especially beat around the bush the entire way. Using his identity as Cloud Gate Elder’s disciple, he threw his manners away during his questioning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, Yu Bo was a calm person that kept his composure no matter how Ye Wansheng monkeyed around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yu Bo, is it that there’s some arch-nemesis of yours in Zhenming Main City, and you’re coming out of retirement to end this grudge? Otherwise, why are you coming out with us young people? No one here will spend time slowly drinking tea with you.” Ye Wansheng asked without giving up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve read too many revenge novels haven’t you? Can I not just come out to get some fresh air? Who said retired people can’t come out to explore occasionally?” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know, you must have heard of my master’s story. This time, you’re coming out to exact revenge upon the man who defeated my master!” Ye Wansheng said with a feigned revelation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“......” Yu Bo was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to say that Ye Wansheng’s imagination truly was colorful, yet he was also getting closer to the truth! Of course, Ye Wansheng wasn't completely correct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Originally, your master told me to inform you only when you reach Zhenming City. However, since you’re so impatient, I’ll tell you first. This time, I wanted to serve my responsibility as a Sacred Guard; I can’t just sit around and eat and live for nothing. Second, I also wanted to help Old Yue with some of his past matters,” Yu Bo slowly explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, what did I say!” Ye Wansheng saw that he guessed right and immediately laughed, gloating to Prince Chao and Shen Mo, “I said I could guess it- you guys owe me a meal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan and Shen Mo’s mouths twitched. If they weren’t this bored on the journey, who would want to bet against him? A few days ago, they bet on how “big” Pang Yue was, yet after they all gave their estimates, no one dared to go and validate their guesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Bo coughed. He had heard Old Yue say that his disciple was very unreliable, but he was finally experiencing it himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kid, don’t get too excited. The person to go forth and deal with Old Yue’s past matters isn’t me. I’m just acting as a guardian and recommendation. You’re the one that has to do it.” Yu Bo continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me? What does this have to do with me? You want me to go fight the person that defeated my master? What a joke, all you ageless monsters have stepped into immortal rank hundreds of years ago. Why would you hold a grudge with someone who hasn’t even lived a hundred years? Ye Wansheng said in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng wasn’t wrong. Cloud Gate Elder had guarded Cloud Gate for countless hundred years. The stories said that Cloud Gate Elder lost to some Border Lord expert, and had to guard Cloud Gate. This means that Cloud Gate Elder was already an immortal rank expert at the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, after this many years later, even if they got completely stuck and became old, it still wasn’t someone he could handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course we’re not telling you to compete against him. You won’t even be able to withstand two of his fingers’ strength. Old Yue heard he has a disciple as well around your age. After all, everyone is this old and may die any day. Old Yue wanted to get this regret over with, and tell you to go compete against that man’s disciple.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I….” Ye Wansheng wanted to curse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That old man wasn’t reliable either! He threw Ye Wansheng right in front of his nemesis. How was he still angry about this after this many centuries? He had to learn to forgive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yu Bo, is that person’s disciple strong?” Ye Wansheng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pretty powerful, or else he wouldn’t be that man’s greatest disciple.” Yu Bo said seemingly carelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What rank is he?” Ye Wansheng continued asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That…… When I first got to New Moon Land, he was probably between perfect dominator rank and pseudo immortal rank. I don’t know if he has broken through by now.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng’s face went black and said, “Go back and tell that old man I’m no longer his disciple anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Too late. Since Old Yue told me to do it, I’ll be responsible for this until the end. You’ll go and fight whether you’re willing or not.” Yu Bo was still his calm self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re telling me to go straight into my death!” Ye Wansheng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng’s strongest Empress Heavenly Thunder Snake was only a top tier dominator rank, still a small distance from the perfect dominator rank. Yet, the other person was at perfect dominator and the pseudo immortal rank since a few years ago. How could he possibly win?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anyways, one of you young ones have to fight for Old Yue, no matter the outcome.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Yu Bo said that, everyone’s gaze fell onto Chu Mu, including Liu Binglan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew Chu Mu had stepped into immortal rank already!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Gate Elder had helped everyone guard New Moon Land. His efforts were great, so he naturally deserved their help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only person able to handle this matter was Chu Mu, since he was the strongest of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Chu Mu was helpless, but he knew he couldn’t avoid this.</span></p>
