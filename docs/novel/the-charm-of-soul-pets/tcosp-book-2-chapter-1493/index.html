 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yellow Springs stared with its round and watery eyes. It seemed like it had never seen a human before, as it inquisitively examined Chu Mu’s legs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was probably wondering how legs like these were able to swim in the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yellow Springs discovered that Chu Mu had used some energy to isolate himself from the water. It slowly extended its claw to touch Chu Mu’s spatial barrier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial barrier was what Chu Mu used to repel the water, making his actions more free.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu watched the small Yellow Springs curiously extend its claws over and a smile rose on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked very cute. Why did the mermaid princess describe the small Yellow Springs as reprehensible?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Mu was wondering, he suddenly discovered that the small Yellow Spring’s fin claw abruptly exploded forth. A cold light flashed by as a sharp force swept by!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The claw’s ripping force was extremely powerful, ripping open Chu Mu’s spatial barrier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was at the bottom of the sea where the water pressure was very strong. Once the spatial barrier was ripped open, the water pierced Chu Mu’s body like sharp swords.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was still admiring the small Yellow Springs. He never expected it to suddenly attack! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shua!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Water burst through the opening, ripping open a wound on Chu Mu’s chest!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood rolled down his chest. He looked like he had been stabbed by a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother!!” Ning Maner turned pale from fright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess was also stunned. She hastily ordered the Ocean Iguana Demon guards to protect Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ni~~~~ Ni~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small Yellow Springs flapped its fins. It seemed very cheerful as its nimble body quickly swam through the water. It swam in a circle and began to energetically stir up the ocean water!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rapid stirring formed the water into a whirlpool that grew increasingly rapid. The Ocean Iguana Demons wanted to stop it, but they were struck by the rapid moving water. They were unable to do anything to the Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess saw that Chu Mu was injured and hastily stretched out her hand and placed it on his chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a bloody wound on Chu Mu’s chest, but no blood flowed out. When the mermaid princess’s fair hand was placed on top, Chu Mu immediately felt warmth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Alongside a prickling feeling, Chu Mu felt his flesh grow and slowly, the pain also disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked down and discovered that the mermaid princess’s palm was shining with a controlling light. Her head was down as she quietly chanted a song-like incantation…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unwittingly, the wound was healed. Chu Mu looked a bit surprisingly at the mermaid princess and said: “Is this the healing method of your Mermaid species?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. We are adept in healing and mental abilities.” said the mermaid princess. She glanced at the wanton and unrestrained small Yellow Springs and said apologetically, “It has always done whatever it wishes. It has powerful and outstanding strength. There aren’t many amongst the Ocean species that can keep it under control.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter. It’s nothing more than a somewhat excessively naughty child.” Chu Mu didn’t care.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it was just naughty, that would be fine…” the mermaid princess forced a smile and shook her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, this fellow is very strange. It isn’t even paying attention to me.” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner innately had the ability to grow intimate with most creatures. However, the Yellow Springs had only given Ning Maner a glance. Clearly, her immortal aura wasn’t the tiniest bit enticing to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was bad news to Chu Mu. He initially wanted Ning Maner to use her natural ability to grow close with the small Yellow Springs. Then, he would slowly trick the small Yellow Springs which wasn’t very mature. Who expected that the small Yellow Springs would ignore Ning Maner? This was an extremely rare occurrence since she often attracted all soul pets!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you communicate with it?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, but it’s ignoring me.” angrily said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also the first time Ning Maner had encountered such a strange soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess swam up to the small Yellow Springs and used a voice as if she was singing a lullaby to communicate with the small Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small Yellow Springs was the master of creating trouble. Every so often it would cause destruction and trick the Ocean Iguana Demons. It wouldn’t listen to what the mermaid princes said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess truly didn’t know what to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you keep being like this, my father will lock you up even longer.” the mermaid princess said to Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t understand the Ocean species’ language. Ning Maner helped him translate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ni~~~ Ni~~~~~~” the small Yellow Springs let out a cry. Ning Maner said that it didn’t care.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess actually wanted nothing more than to send away this pestilence. Eastern Ocean was already messy enough. If this fellow were to one day go insane…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s leave first. It’s temper is very strange. Normally I’m able to communicate with it. Something abnormal is happening…” the mermaid princess helpless shook her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four Ocean Iguana Demons the mermaid princess had brought had been thoroughly bullied. But the Yellow Springs didn’t seem to think that was much fun. Its eyes would glance at Chu Mu every so often, as it wanted to cause trouble for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this fellow was very cautious. It ostensibly knew that Chu Mu’s strength was higher than these Ocean Iguana Demons. Besides the initial sneak attack, it didn’t dare swim near Chu Mu. It was afraid that he would retaliate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could also see that this Yellow Springs was a troublesome fellow. If he couldn’t even communicate with it, there was no way he would be able to convince it to become his soul pet. He also couldn’t use strength to solve the problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, Chu Mu didn’t think his strength could solve this problem. This place was the deep sea and Chu Mu’s strength was severely limited. On the other hand, the Yellow Springs could move as it pleased her. From the strength it just exhibited, he wouldn’t be able to subdue it. Instead, there was a chance he could be subdued.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus he could only take time considering how to guide it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the trench barrier was closed up again, the small Yellow Springs didn’t seem to like being alone. After the mermaid princess and Chu Mu left, it angrily smashed into the barrier, wanting to break free of this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you have any ideas?” the mermaid princess asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lock it up for a bit for now.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The time we’ve kept it locked up is too long. When it gets out, it will be even more angry.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s fine. Your Eastern Ocean has already locked it up, and it will always be angry and hateful over that. It doesn’t matter if you keep it locked up longer. I can see that it really likes to play around. However, its playing is a bit excessive.” said Chu Mu. “Keep it locked up for a bit and no matter how much it throws a tantrum, ignore it. Treat it as if it will be imprisoned here.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” the mermaid princess felt a bit embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the entire Ocean species, who dared imprison this small ancestor!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I also agree with what young master said. It’s like a human child. The more you spoil it, the more this fosters its temper. The small Yellow Springs innately probably just wants to have fun. I’m not sure what caused its playing and mischievousness to immensely expand. Adding on the fact that it innately has shocking destructive power, this has led to it being used to being feared by others. The more your Ocean species fears it, the more you don’t dare adopt tougher attitudes towards it and the more terrible it becomes. Perhaps by the time its intelligence is mature and it is stronger, a second Ancient Flood Dragon Person will be born.” said Old Li. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are…” the mermaid princess saw Old Li and opened her mouth in slight shock, “Aren’t you the Demon species’ wise man?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe.” Old Li let out a dry laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the envoy of a large, prosperous species as well, Old Li didn’t have the face to say he had been expelled…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, my intentions were the same. It needs to be controlled and constrained. Otherwise, when it turns destruction and ruin into its own form of entertainment, when it matures, its desire for invasion and slaughter will become extremely terrifying,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yellow Springs was also a creature with intelligence. Every creature had their own individual personality and tendencies. Since the Ocean species was a civilized ocean nation, the manifestation of the Ancient Flood Dragon Person, which was the evil of Eternal Ocean that would scare others at its mere mention, definitely had a cause from when it was young. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who could guarantee that the child of Ancient Flood Dragon person wasn’t like the small Yellow Springs where it was allowed to run amok and was excessively spoiled?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu raised soul pets, he was very strict. He also paid attention to the soul pet’s natural disposition while raising it. For example, the Little Hidden Dragon initially was too reliant on others. Thus, Chu Mu had ruthlessly thrown it into a group of monsters to fight and let it temper itself through wounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the small Yellow Springs was normally like this, Chu Mu had to correct it first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Chu Mu was certain the Yellow Springs was his soul pet. Since he was certain, he had to take take care of it regardless if he had signed the soul pact or not.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, we’ll do as you say. I’ll tell my father first. I hope your method will be useful.” the mermaid princess let out a faint smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess had been looking for someone willing to take care of this matter. Thus, she would help Chu Mu as best as she could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, from his memories, the mermaid princess had learned that Chu MU was an extremely outstanding soul pet trainer. Perhaps this human really would be able to control this undisciplined and out of control small Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m curious about something. It’s so young, so why does it have such powerful strength?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that it accidentally ate some special cultivation immortal item and its speed of growth is several times faster than other Yellow Springs.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then is it innate disposition related to what it accidentally ate?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… I’m not too sure either.” the mermaid princess naturally didn’t know this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered that Ye Qingzi had said that some excessively strong immortal items would stimulate a soul pet’s mind. This was comparable to Chu Mu’s devil transformation. When he transformed into a devil, his soul and consciousness suffered extremely painful devil flame burning. Under these circumstances, he was unable to think and could only ceaselessly vent the desire for violent and slaughter in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the small Yellow Spring’s strangeness was related to what it accidentally ate.&nbsp;</span></p>
