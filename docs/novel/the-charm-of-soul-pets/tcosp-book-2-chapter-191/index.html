 <p><strong>Chapter 191: Escape, Danger</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lang clenched his blood-filled teeth. His eyes were nearly spewing flames. As a young generation expert whose fame was widespread, he never would’ve thought that he would be backstabbed by the people of the Elemental Sect, yet now, he could only watch as his soul pets were ganged up upon…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A scream sounded out and &nbsp;the woman soul pet trainer Feng Ya finally couldn’t protect herself in the surrounded attacks. Her abdomen was pierced by the Purple Lightning Devil, and her body immediately fell in a pool of blood…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feng Ya!!” Yu Lang’s entire face bulged with veins. Watching his own woman die horribly under the opponent’s soul pets- he was already on the verge of going mad already!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how hard Yu Lang struggled, Feng Ya still couldn’t escape this disaster. After she fell in her pool of blood, the Evil Flame Demon’s evil flame immediately landed on her and quickly burned her body into dust…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lang felt his heart torn apart as he watched. The anger that threatened to explode from his body all gathered within his bloodshot eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Yu Lang’s eyes burst, sending blood out from his eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, his body was shrouded by some special energy. This energy abruptly slammed into the Ice Winged Tiger and sent the seventh phase Ice Winged Tiger flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quick, attack him!” Qing Li didn’t expect Yu Lang to have such a self-destructing soul technique, and he quickly roared at the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xi!!!!!!!!” The monarch ranked golden bug type soul pet emitted a radiance and charged out of the surroundings, immediately running towards its owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lang had lost both his eyes, and he couldn’t tell directions, but feeling his soul pet near, he immediately jumped onto the bug monarch’s body!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Houhou!!!!” The Thunder Sword Winged Lion also knew that its owner was in danger, so it used its body to block the joint attack of the multiple elemental world soul pets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purple lion jumped high up, but it was instantly engulfed by different colored energy. With a massive boom, the eighth phase Thunder Sword Winged Tiger was blown to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lying on the golden bug monarch, Yu Lang’s face immediately paled, and his bloody eyes again let out two lines of blood tears…...</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side of the mountain, Chu Mu sat not far from the entrance and, as he was silently meditating, he quickly noticed that there were signs of wobbling from deep in the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Chu Mu looked deep into the cave and asked while revealing confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it may be that they met some blocking soul pets and have had a battle. This hole has many branches, so there has to be some that weren’t completely cleaned out.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu only nodded out of courtesy, clearly not believing in Zeng Linshan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You guys sit here and rest for a bit. I’ll head in to see. Maybe they walked in the wrong direction.” Zeng Linshan continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En” Chu Mu still nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys just wait here, be very careful not to walk around randomly. If you walk the wrong direction, it won’t be good.” Zeng Linshan specially added before walking into the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Zeng Linshan slowly disappear into the cave, Chu Mu’s face clearly shifted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Ye Qingzi saw that Chu Mu’s eyes were already showing coldness and asked softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The third possibility happened.” Chu Mu said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi didn’t know what the third possibility was when Chu Mu mentioned it before, so she only looked questioningly at Chu Mu to wait for him to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The five Elemental Sect people have a plot. Looking at the situation, they very likely want to deal with Soul Palace’s Yu Lang and Feng Ya!” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi immediately showed surprise, and she especially looked into the deep cave. Ye Qingzi considered the first two situations, but indeed didn’t think that the five Elemental Sect people would try to dispose of Yu Lang and Feng Ya.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lang and Feng Ya were invited to this Heavenly Crystal Mountain, so presumably the Soul Palace knew they went training with Elemental Sect people. If they had some accident, Soul Palace would definitely think of Elemental Sect as the first reason, so Elemental Sect people shouldn’t have attacked them this brashly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless, this was all premeditated, or Elemental Sect’s people have already designed a seemingly accidental death for Yu Lang and Feng Ya that couldn’t possibly make Soul Palace put their sights on them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then now we….?” Looking at the current situation, Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi were equally in danger, because Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi were foreign. To hide the truth, if the Elemental Sect really wanted to kill Yu Lang and Feng Ya, then after they deal with them, they had to come over and kill the two who knew the truth to prevent the news from leaking!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re currently at the half mountain point. If we fly straight down, we would definitely get chased by a large group of soul pets. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder that Qing Li looked at us weirdly when he saw us. It turns out we were disrupting his plan. Then what do we do now? Zhang Qing and Qing Li are both very powerful, and we won’t be their match in a straight up fight.” Ye Qingzi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, though we can’t be 100% sure, we’d rather believe so than not. We can only walk upwards now and have a to-and-fro tussle with them.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi trusted Chu Mu’s judgement, and she didn’t hesitate for long before jumping onto her Dream Beast to follow Chu Mu along the rather safe steep mountain pass and started climbing.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeng Linshan, you did well. When we go back I will definitely give you a large prize!” Qing Li laughed and patted Zeng Linshan on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeng Linshan opened his mouth wide, looking very satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeng Linshan’s luck was very good. When he left Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi, he summoned his own soul pet because he guessed he would need to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after going deep, he immediately saw the heavily wounded Yu Lang and his monarch rank bug type soul pet. His three soul pets all simultaneously blocked off the bug type monarch’s escape route.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lang originally had a chance at escaping, but Zeng Linshan’s appearance lost him his last hope. When the other four people caught up, Yu Lang’s monarch rank soul pet was also killed, and he ultimately died under the claws of Ice Winged Tiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, eighth level bug type monarch soul crystal!” When Zhang Qin told his own soul pet to rip up Yu Lang’s bug type soul pet, he immediately found treasure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eighth level bug type monarch rank soul crystal was worth 30 million gold in value. Being able to kill Yu Lang and Feng Ya’s soul pets, the value of the soul crystals they gained was not a small sum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Li directly took from Yu Lang his spatial ring and started to look through to see if there was anything of value in there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, this guy. There’s nothing but some medicine for wilderness battles and some very inexpensive stuff. Seems like the real things of value he all keeps in Soul Palace.” Qing Li spat on the ground and said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All the soul equipment was self destructed by him. It really makes me want to desecrate his body some more!” Zhang Qian kicked the bloody corpse of Yu Lang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing good left, stop looking. There’s other stuff to do.” Qing Li waved his hands to stop them from searching the bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeng Linshan, where are the two people?” Qing Li asked with a baleful look. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi’s appearance indeed was beyond Qing Li’s expectation. Fortunately, he changed his plans according to the situatio,n and sent them away so that he wouldn’t lose this opportunity to kill Yu Lang and Feng Ya.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lang was the son of Soul palace seventh Palace master. His position within Soul Palace was very high, so normally no one dared to even touch him. If he didn’t take care of after events, his Elemental Sect would definitely not be removed of blame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re still waiting stupidly outside.” Zeng Linshan laughed. This time Zeng Linshan truly did a great service. All they needed to do now was to get rid of the two people, and he would be heavily rewarded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, good.” Qing Li nodded satisfactorily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qing Li, that Chu Mu is the subordinate of Soul Palace young master. If they kill him, will we drag out the Soul Palace young master? Young masters aren’t something we can mess with.” Zhang Qing said in a lower voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re already at this step. If we don’t kill him, we all will die. We can’t care about that much anymore. Just continue as planned, and deal with them as we deal with Feng Ya and Yu Lang.” A viciousness flashed through Qing Li’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s all we can do.” Zhang Qing nodded. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and smiled, “That girl was the fellow’s sister and is someone young master wants. If we take her alive, maybe young master will be even happier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes yes yes, capture her alive. That woman’s body shape is spectacular. The entire way I was thinking that, if we get rid of Yu Lang and Feng Ya, maybe we could……” Zeng Linshan nodded very vigorously, his eyes full of lust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pa!!!!!” Suddenly, a slap fell on Zeng Linshan’s face, dragging him away from his daydream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Useless trash, how dare you think of a woman that young master wants!” Qing Li raged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t dare, I don’t dare……” Zeng Linshan immediately put his head down and didn’t dare to say much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, Qing Li and Zhang Qing was also very interested in the pretty women. Especially since they were already on the verge of killing, they had thought of leaving Feng Ya alive for a bit and play with her before killing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Qing Li and Zhang Qing were both ruthless people. They knew that such thoughts may ruin the greater picture, so they decisively killed Feng Ya without giving her the chance to summon her soul pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Ye Qingzi, Qing Li and Zhang Qin definitely needed to follow young master’s orders and capture her alive and bring her to Li City. Even if he had evil desires, he had to suppress them…...</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shameful thing, where are they?!” Qing Li heavily slappe Zeng Linshan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeng Linshan looked at the empty cave entrance and held his bloodied mouth corner and said in fear and trepidation, “I told them not to walk around randomly. They might be moving around nearby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can it be that they’ve noticed?” Zhang Qin looked around nearby and didn’t find Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, they could only have walked down this path. No matter if they went downhill or other paths, there would definitely be soul pet clans that resided in the way. Let’s all go and chase forward!” Qing Li said coldly!</span></p>
