The ninth rank defense of these tenth phase commanders couldn’t even withstand one blow in front of Zhan Ye, and the Destructive Ray’s strength easily blew apart their shells, exploding on their flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hou!!!!!” Zhan Ye flew forward. His speed had already surpassed Mo Xie’s, and the scratches that came on like a storm from several Thousand Legged Centipedes were unable to injure Zhan Ye’s skin as it easily passed through the obstruction of several Thousand Legged Centipedes. Its claws respectively swept across two of the Thousand Legged Centipedes that had been injured by the Destructive Ray!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sharp claws swept ten meters, and the two Thousand Legged Centipedes were respectively split into four pieces from the location they ulcerated. Quickly, they fell amongst the other corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After killing these two Thousand Legged Centipedes, Zhan Ye’s claws savagely ripped apart one of the Thousand Legged Centipede’s body and rapidly picked out its soul core before consuming it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After chewing through the soul core, Zhan Ye was quickly met by the besiegement of Thousand Legged Centipedes and was pounded back into the corpse pile by them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was difficult now for the Thousand Legged Centipedes to break apart Zhan Ye’s defense. Not only did they merely leave a few light scratches on its ink armor, but they couldn’t even actually injure it. Before long, the light scratches would be healed by the self-healing ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rock barrier space was limited and the size of these Thousand Legged Centipedes was over ten meters while there were over a hundred of these tenth phase commanders as Zhan Ye’s opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, the area behind the rock barrier could only hold a few of these tenth phase commanders as they moved and attacked. If there were too many, they would trap their comrades. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If seventeen Thousand Legged Centipedes simultaneously launched attacks at Zhan Ye, perhaps they would deal heavy damage to it. However, the incomparably sturdy rock barrier provided a natural protection to Zhan Ye, and it didn’t allow that many opponents to occupy this area at once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as the fight was still within the range Zhan Ye’s abilities could handle, Zhan Ye’s strength would slowly increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thousand Legged Centipedes from the edge of the abyss to the inner parts of the abyss happened to be segregated from weak to strong. Further adding on the limited number of Thousand Legged Centipedes that could be within the rock barrier, this was equivalent to continuously feeding Zhan Ye’s abnormal abilities, Broken Limb Rebirth and Brave Stinging Heart, which allowed its strength continuously increase!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no technique could be perfect. Broken Limb rebirth was a technique that allowed for rapid self-healing from heavy wounds while also recovering life force, but physical strength and endurance wouldn’t fully recover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhan Ye’s explosive fighting strength and energy couldn’t appear just out of the blue. In fact, its physical strength had already reached its limit, and every time it used a technique, it required several soul crystals containing large amounts of energy as support.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two soul crystals would appear for every four Thousand Legged Centipedes. However, even if they were ninth rank soul crystals, they couldn’t keep up with Zhan Ye’s continuous exhaustion of its physical strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time after Zhan Ye killed on Thousand Legged Centipede, it wouldn’t hesitate to consume a soul core and use it to maintain its physical strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, Zhan Ye had already consumed numerous soul crystals from killing, and these soul crystals were essentially the true reason why Zhan Ye was able to find the energy to continue fighting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, when a corpse pile of over a hundred manifested behind the rock barrier, Zhan Ye’s body strength went over its limit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhan Ye had already overdrafted its physical strength, and being able to continue to this point was entirely reliant on the soul crystals that occasionally appeared. These soul crystals were equivalent to using stimulants on its body as they unceasingly stimulated all of the energy in its body while also allowing Zhan Ye to use techniques. However, Zhan Ye couldn’t continue forever because of soul crystals… &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the top of the enormous mountain and in the expansive blue heavens, the extremely pale faced Pan Zheng rode on his soul pet. His gaze was staring down at the enormous mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next to Pan Zheng was Ling He whose face was also dark. Ling He had lost a tenth phase soul pet which was also his Ardent Sun Rhinoceros that he had spent so much on. Such a blow to a person who had already stepped onto the apex of the younger generation was extremely heavy. At the very least, the current Ling He no longer had the qualifications to content with Soul Alliance’s Si Tian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master brought Shen Yicheng and left. I’m not quite sure what use master still has with a trash like him.” said Pan Zheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pan Zheng had lost two main pets and to a soul pet trainer, this was a fatal injury. However, he would still continue to devote himself to his female master because if he obtained his female master’s appreciation, it wouldn’t be difficult to obtain a powerful monarch rank soul pet. Moreover, it could very well be a high class monarch!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The undulations of any soul pet’s strength was extremely large and reaching a trough wasn’t anything huge to any soul pet trainer that reaching for great heights. In only one or two years, the soul would recover and they could continue searching for new soul pets and raise them up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul pet trainers grew increasingly proficient at training soul pets and after they knew how to raise one, it would be easier for them to raise a young soul pet to the ninth or tenth phase than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling He had lost a middle class monarch, but he had the same mindset as Pan Zheng. After the plan ended this time, he would obtain a treasured high class monarch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a two level difference between the middle class monarch and high class monarch. Moreover, to most soul pet trainers, this was an extremely difficult barrier to overcome, especially if it was a soul pet with a low species rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ardent Sun Rhinoceros was a middle class commander, and even though its aptitude was high, due to its innate species, it was unable to break through to the high class monarch rank even after Ling He had bought it soul items to help numerous times. It was during these moments that a true high class monarch meant a lot more because there was a chance it could evolve to the peak monarch or even emperor rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pan Zheng was continuously berating the half-dead Shen Yicheng, because he didn’t understand why the female master was bringing Shen Yicheng to the end of the bewildering world to successfully finish the realm breakthrough while leaving the two of them to intercept and kill Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling He just listened to Pan Zheng’s trash talk, but didn’t say a word. In truth, he was sneering in his heart.</span></p>

In the subsequent realm breakthroughs his value would be next to nothing. This fellow ostensibly had yet to realize he would be discarded- just like Shen Yicheng.&nbsp;</span></p>

Zhan Ye knew that an even stronger Thousand Legged Centipede had appeared and it was extremely large. The rock barrier which it had originally believed would inhibit their movements would probably be destroyed soon.</span></p>

What Zhan Ye needed the most was precisely the most sincere conviction and respect.&nbsp;</span></p>
