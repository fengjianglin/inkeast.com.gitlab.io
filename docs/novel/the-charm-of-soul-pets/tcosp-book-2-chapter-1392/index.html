 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial gate to the Imprint Valley was within a valley in the mountain range of the Divine Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The valley was long and narrow. There were many plant type creatures growing along the way. They would open up the way when people walked near it, appearing to be scared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plants in the valley would slowly part as Chu Mu, Xia Yin, Lin Mengling and the rest entered. However, after they walked past them, the plants would return to their original position. If not for someone leading the way for them, it would be very difficult to find such a special path in the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial gate was at the end of the valley. It was a majestic cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many patterns drawn on the surface of the cliff, carrying an ancient metaphorical meaning. In any case, Chu Mu could not comprehend them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person guiding the three of them was none other than Divine Sect’s Magistrate Xiao, Xiao Xueang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang was not a very talkative person, he had always been a stern person. After arriving at the cliff, he walked forward on his own and began chanting an incomprehensible incantation while touching the cliff with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancient characters and the tiny diagrams on the cliff gradually began to glow. It felt as if the cliff paintings had come to life and began dancing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the glow was at its brightest point, a narrow spatial crack appeared on the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial crack was very deep, and the end could not be seen. It was connected to a mysterious and unknown world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Chu Mu had seen an isolated space outside of New Moon Land. He began pondering over whether this Imprint Valley was the second or the third layer within the bottom three layers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enter, this is a sacred cultivation ground, as well as a burial ground. Don’t risk your lives easily for profit. That will only lock you inside forever,” advised Xiao Xueang seriously to the three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three nodded. Xia Yin walked at the forefront. His gaze showed that he had long been anticipating about entering this Imprint Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu followed after him. It was not the first time that he had stepped into an isolated space, so he was not overly cautious towards an unknown dimension like Lin Mengling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, this Imprint Valley belongs to the third layer of the earth amongst the lower three layers. There are plenty of resources inside, but that also means that the creatures inside are very powerful,” reminded Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp Old Li could immediately sense the immense potential after Chu Mu had just stepped into that space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third layer......” Chu Mu was deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power that he possessed was related to the lower three layer space. With his current ability, he could directly tear open a second layer space and did not need to go through a spatial gate to enter an isolated space like the Holy Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he could not directly enter a third layer space like that. After all, the spatial turbulence around the third layer space was way too violent, enough to rip apart Chu Mu’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li had once described the structure of the dimensions to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were around five layers of dimensions. The centermost layer was the world where the humans and soul pets lived in. This world did not have any form of spatial storm or spatial turbulence. There was sunlight, land, ocean, plants and living creatures there. It was the most complete world with life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, it would be the upper and lower first layer dimension next, they were called the second layer of the sky and the second layer of the earth respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the region with spatial turbulence and spatial storm where living creatures could not survive was considered a sea of death, while the region where living creatures could survive was considered an island, then the second layer of sky or earth were like barren sea's of death, with a few islands spread out on the sea without any pattern to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those islands were the isolated spaces that people would mention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was rather familiar with the second layer of earth. Nightmare Holy Region, seven Holy Regions, Soul Pet Palace Holy Region, Immortal City, Sealed Tower......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were all isolated spaces that belonged to the second layer of sky or earth. Furthermore, Chu Mu could travel within the spatial turbulence of the second layer, so in theory he could freely walk from the Nightmare Holy Region to one of the seven Holy Regions if the direction was correct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the third layer of sky or earth, Chu Mu had actually visited it before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Land actually had a gate that connected to a certain isolated space in the third layer of earth. It was the Dormant World in Immortal City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A world covered in pure white, an isolated space within an isolated space. The space that had sealed Bai Yu for twenty years was in the third layer of earth. However, that was a really small desolate island in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imprint Valley was in the third layer of earth. The trio had to first reach the second layer of earth before entering the Imprint Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial passage was pitch black. Chu Mu and Xia Yin walked at the front and did not feel any form of discomfort. Lin Mengling followed the two of them from a slight distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does Miss Lin Mengling also have something that you are afraid of?” teased Xia Yin as he turned back and saw Lin Mengling acting so cautiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just feel a slight discomfort,” snorted Lin Mengling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The air within the spatial passage is fairly thin and contains dark elements. Adjust your breathing slightly and avoid taking in the dark elements , that will make you feel more comfortable,” reminded Chu Mu as he saw Lin Mengling’s pale face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling did feel a little stuffy and was a little panicked, so she did as Chu Mu suggested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The discomfort gradually disappeared and Lin Mengling had recovered a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Mengling’s skin was originally as white as snow, so she still looked pale even after recovering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you,” Lin Mengling felt much better and thanked Chu Mu. However, she was wondering how Chu Mu knew about all that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu seems to be well versed regarding Other type creatures?” Xia Yin grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I have an Other type soul pet,” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they continued walking forward, a light dot finally appeared at the end of the dark spatial passage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light dot seemed to be really close, but they still had to walk a long distance to reach it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ray of sunlight shone down from above and the scene before their eyes had immediately brightened up. It felt as if they had just walked out from a dark cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? The Imprint Valley is actually such a beautiful place. I had thought that it would be a desolate land without any light,” Lin Mengling’s eyes sparkled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A green plain, a clear lake that reflected the blue sky, a mountain range that was connected by gentle mountains. There was no impurity, it was clean and refreshing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing too many beautiful and majestic sceneries, Lin Mengling felt that she was liberated from her oppressed mood after seeing such a simple scenery. She was just like a little girl who had discovered something new, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin and Chu Mu had gone to various places and had also seen various sceneries. Although this plain scenery did look refreshing, there was no need to get so excited about it, was there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So the cold and impartial Magistrate Lin was actually a countryside girl in her heart, how cute,” teased Xia Yin again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling realized that her behavior did not match her identity. She hurriedly put on a solemn expression and coldly replied, “I just like this place! Can’t I?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, people say that noble ladies like country bumpkins, this seems to be true after all. Brother Chu and I both came from the countryside. The sceneries we have at our places would definitely suit the taste of our beautiful lady Lin. Please visit us if you have the time and bring some fame to our humble places. Don’t you think so too, brother Chu?” said Xia Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“True, there are plenty of such clean sceneries there,” Chu Mu nodded. If Lin Mengling really preferred such sceneries, then Xiang Rong City should be to her liking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling was the cherished pearl of Divine Sect. Everyone was desperately trying to appeal to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu would not purposely try to appeal to Lin Mengling, but maintaining a friendly relationship was also important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ulterior motives,” Lin Mengling directly ignored Chu Mu and Xia Yin. She walked ahead first towards the direction of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Xia Yin were not really interested in this place. So, while Lin Mengling was enjoying the scenery, the two of them were looking for the spatial gate towards the third layer of earth following Xiao Xueang’s instruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, they found the spatial gate and called for Lin Mengling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Lin Mengling knew the incantation. Chu Mu and Xia Yin could not open the gate. They definitely could not enter Imprint Valley without going through the spatial gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling did not linger around too much and opened the spatial gate that connected to the Imprint Valley after chanting the incantation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The refreshing scenery at the second layer of earth had brightened up Lin Mengling’s mood. However, after actually entering the Imprint Valley, she started frowning deeply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky was shrouded with dense dark clouds that it almost reached the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The barren land did not have any plants at all. The brown and black rocks were spread out raggedly. Various strange trenches crossed one another. Rocky mountains were erected haphazardly. Deep and dark valleys......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Imprint Valley, completely the opposite of the beautiful scenery from a moment ago. It was also the exact horrible image that Lin Mengling had in mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin shrugged his shoulders and was about to tease Lin Mengling, but stopped in his tracks after he saw Lin Mengling glaring at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stood on the spot and glanced around, trying to find some familiarities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed to have seen this cold and hard barren land as well as the mysterious pressure somewhere before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had travelled to many places. Endless ocean, vast forests, boundless glaciers......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was his first time to the Imprint Valley, yet he somehow felt a little familiar towards this place. Could it be a portion of the memory from the Heaven Boundary Monument?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That memory did not contain such a barren image though. Perhaps it could be said that he only possessed a small portion of the entire memory, some of the memories were still buried deep within his soul and were not awakened yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwu~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie cried on Chu Mu’s shoulder, it was not known whether it liked or disliked this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu rubbed its fluffy ears and smiled, “There are plenty of powerful creatures here, you won’t get bored.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Mo Xie nodded eagerly to his words and kept swinging its nine tails.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An enormous pair of wings appeared in front of the three of them from the dense clouds. The powerful flapping sounds entered their ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a huge silhouette, and it had a powerful aura while it flew past them near the bottom of the clouds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It only flew past them without taking a glance at the three of them and gradually disappeared into the distant clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That...... That’s......” Xia Yin watched the departing silhouette absentmindedly, his eyes filled with astonishment.</span></p>
