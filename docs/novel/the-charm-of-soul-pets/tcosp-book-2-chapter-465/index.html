This leader of the killers was presently trying to break through the second remembrance to the third remembrance.&nbsp;</span></p>

They had laid down killing traps in the jungle, and there were few who could pass through the jungle, let alone make their way to the center of this camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, this leader of the killers was seated without worry or stress. He was concentrated and had entered a state of silent cultivation.</span></p>

He subconsciously harrumphed: “Didn’t I tell you not to disturb me?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leader of the killers opened his eyes to see who the person who disturbed him was. Immediately, his expression changed and he hastily stood up. He knelt in front of the man who entered and fearfully said: “My lord, this subordinate didn’t know it was you who had come. Please forgive me… please forgive me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the situation like?” the man indifferently swept his eyes over the leader of the killers and asked a question.&nbsp;</span></p>

It’s probably due to the appearance of some hidden expert in the second grade. Old Nine’s situation hasn’t been reported yet, but he should have succeeded.” responded the leader of the killers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Before I came here, I already saw that those three people died in Chu Chen’s hands. Could it be that Chu Chen can be considered a hidden expert?” said the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Chen? This subordinate didn’t realize that I had sent people to kill him.” the leader of the killers slightly raised his head, but didn’t dare look at the man’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He was once Prison Island’s King and his ability to survive in the wilderness is much stronger than you group of trash. Perhaps he’s hiding nearby, and will come and take your worthless life at any moment!” the man’s eyes turned vicious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This subordinate was careless. This subordinate was careless.” the leader of the killers hastily said, “My lord, don’t worry. As long as he appears, I’ll definitely catch him. Senior Shen has already given this task to us!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has Senior Hao given you any other instructions recently?” asked the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Other instructions?” the leader of the killers thought carefully before responding, “No. We listen to your commands and are ordained to Senior Shen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did your master specially request for you to do anything?” the man continued to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This subordinate has never seen master before, but knows she’s in the seventh realm. My lord, why did you appear here? Isn’t your realm breakthrough mission…” the leader of the killer’s tone turned strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment his words came out, the man’s eyes underwent extreme change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lue!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a sharp cold light swept past, and the edge of a blade streaked across the the leader of the killer’s neck, tearing open his artery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, blood began to spurt out, splashing over the tent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leader of the killers eyes opened wide. As he was asking that question, he had truthfully already raised his guard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had still reacted too slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his life quickly slipped away, he stared at the man in front. In his vision that was gradually blurring, he found that this man’s face and temperament was slowly changing, as he transformed into another person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu released his soul remembrance and controlled the stench of blood, preventing it from spreading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He coldly stood next to the leader of the killer’s corpse. In fact, the leader of the killer being in a concentrated state of silent cultivation had presented Chu Mu the opportunity to create a dream realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering the dream realm, the leader of the killer had unawaringly taken Chu Mu to be their master. Chu Mu had taken advantage of this, and attempted to play along.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu knew that every killer had undergone strict training, and that their vigilance was extremely heightened. Consequently, Chu Mu had been very careful as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Chu Mu could see that this leader of the killers responded very carefully. He had pretty much given Chu Mu no information that he could use; that is, until his last sentence where he mentioned that his lord was in the seventh realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was certain this group of killers listened to direct orders from Shen Yicheng, which meant that Shen Yicheng was definitely in this seventh realm. Moreover, it was very likely him that had murdered the competition authorities, having these killers head to the finish first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the leader of the killer’s words, aside from Shen Yicheng, there was another person who was referred to as a lord. This person was absolutely crucial, and very likely had direct relation to the defector young woman who was controlling everything behind the scenes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu could feel that he was already touching the influence of the defector young woman and was approaching, step by step, the plot she had laid down in the Battle of the Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu could not let the defector young woman do as she pleased. No matter what traps she had set up in the seventh realm, Chu Mu had to find them out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, I feel that there’s a rather suspicious person…” at this point, Old Li’s voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Zhang.” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you feel that he’s suspicious? At least when we were travelling together, that fellow didn’t reveal anything suspicious about himself.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu rarely formed teams with others. Even if he did form a team, he would always have extremely high vigilance against them. Therefore, when Princess Jin Rou had mentioned she wanted to slowly accept other team members, Chu Mu had expressed his staunch opposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu would have rathered face a large group of enemies before having to watch the every step of the so called “teammates” next to him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a feeling. Firstly, his aura hiding ability is extremely strong. Although he said that he often trained in the wild, it’s actually very likely it’s an ability from being a killer. Secondly, the expression he showed when he saw you dragging the corpses, it was as if his body had gone cold before he showed an expression of shock. Finally, just as you were leaving and I was lying on the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s body, I carefully examined him and found that within his complicated expression was a slight trace of happiness.” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think that he has another target? Or in other words, is he also a killer? I’ve seen these kinds of tricks many times before, but I feel that there really is no need for him do something like this.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s not necessarily true. For example, and I’m only giving an example, what if he was there for Princess Jin Rou?” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There for her? There’s no logic behind that. Also, Princess Jin Rou has heard of him before. One of her guards rescued him. Wait...No, that’s not right. What if they wanted to control Princess Jin Rou earlier, and had sent someone to lay this elaborate scheme even before.” Chu Mu quickly realized that something was wrong. &nbsp;</span></p>

Liu Zhang definitely knows that you’ve already entered the killers’ camp and, in a little, if the formation of the killers changes, then that pretty much proves that he reported this to them.” said Old Li.</span></p>

This was because once the killers’ formation had changed, it meant that they had all changed their target to him.&nbsp;</span></p>

He wanted to leave the extremely dangerous killers’ camp as fast as possible.</span></p>

It was when the leader of the killers mentioned Old Nine that I abruptly thought of this possibility.” said Old Li.</span></p>

These soul pets were all targeting him, evidently because they discovered him!</span></p>

When he had entered the leader of the killers’ tent, he hadn’t disturbed any killer and he had cleaned up afterwards very cleanly. Even if these killers had spotted an intruder, it was impossible for them to change their formation that quickly. The only explanation was that the killers had already prepared to catch a turtle in a jar!!&nbsp;</span></p>

This scheme was something Chu Mu was familiar with, but he never expected to be caught in it.&nbsp;</span></p>

The problem was that Princess Jin Rou was too unaccustomed to the wilderness and even if she was careful, she would probably accidentally fall into the trap set by Liu Zhang and these killers!&nbsp;</span></p>

After Chu Mu’s body passed by, most of the trees on either side of him collapsed. If he had been even slightly slower, him and the Night Thunder Dream Beast would have been decapitated at the waist! &nbsp;</span></p>

She ripped apart a resplendent fire arc in the dark air with her royal flame claws, shredding the green eyed demon blocking Chu Mu’s path in front into pieces!!&nbsp;</span></p>
