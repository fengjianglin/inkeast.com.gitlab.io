The noise was like rolling thunder. Truly a scene!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The noise persisted for a long time, and the referees had to wait for the wave of sound to slowly die down before announcing the outcome of the beast fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honor challenge was the difficulty of a round exceptionally amplified, especially the fourth wave of this challenge. This was a soul pet that second grade members would be hard pressed to kill. All this was to obtain a higher ranking through persisting for a longer period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From thirty minutes into this challenging beast fight, he managed to narrowly avert heart-wrenching danger and climb back up to his feat from pools of blood time and time again until he finished this extremely dangerous honor challenge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This required not only bravery and willpower, but also a conviction to fight that even made those older members spectating sigh!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the referee announced the outcome of the competition!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, tens of thousands of eyes were on Chu Mu. They watched this brave beastfighter create a miracle, wondering what he would do next. Would he walk towards them or return in honor back to his rest place…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, everyone discovered that this admirable young man carrying wounds, yet somehow gigantic in stature, walk towards the Soul Palace seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t head to the rest area. Instead, he walked in front of a beautiful woman at the confusion of everyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingzi, I’ll have to trouble you again to heal my soul pets.” Chu Mu cracked a smile and his pair of black pupils stared at Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this carefree man stood in front of her, Ye Qingzi didn’t know what to say for a minute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t bother remaining on the beast fighting stage that the tens of thousands of people were currently looking at, nor did he use the opportunity to prove something to them. Instead, he walked straight to her and said something simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s actions caused her heartbeat to speed up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that Chu Mu wouldn’t immediately think of honor after the end of fights. Instead, he would always think of his soul pets that had fought a bloody and difficult battle for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, from his eyes, Ye Qingzi could read another emotion. Even if he didn’t say anything, she understood that his eyes were telling her that he could obtain the first realm’s honor and thus could obtain the ninth realm’s ultimate honor. He would obtain the hidden will for her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi’s eyes were a bit moist. When she thought of the heartbreaking pain from the Dream Reflection shattering at the last moment, and then looked at the determined eyes of the man in front of her, an intense and unstoppable feeling suddenly arose in her heart. She felt a bit dazzled as she stared in his eyes. There was something else at work that caused her eyes to turn away and she couldn’t stare at Chu Mu like this anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingzi, what’s the matter?” Chu Mu saw that Ye Qingzi was staring at him, but wasn’t talking. He could feel something in her eyes, but didn’t know what it was, so he asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t quite understand what women thought about in their hearts. Seeing Ye Qingzi like this, he was completely oblivious. Finally, Chu Mu could only shake his head and his cold face showed a rare cute expression as he said: “If it’s not convenient to heal, I’ll heal them myself…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wansheng who was standing next to her heard Chu Mu’s words before exaggeratedly stamping his feet, beating his chest and shouting: “Idiot, take advantage of this ice melting and quickly hug her. Do you think that an opportunity like this will always come along?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was stunned, and didn’t know what to do after Ye Wansheng scolded him. He really did want to give Ye Qingzi a hug, but he still had blood on his body and felt it wasn’t appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, since Ye Wansheng had said so, Chu Mu made the prompt decision to do so. Such an opportunity was truly rare so he may as well give her a hug.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi came back to her senses and glared at Ye Wansheng who was telling others to do mischievous things. She quickly wiped her hand over the corner of her eye and in a warm and elegant voice, laughed and said: “Give me your soul…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi got half way before the scent of a man, mixed with blood, hit her head on. Immediately after, she was embraced by the wide arms of a man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t care right now if Ye Qingzi was clear-headed and very straightforwardly gave her a hug!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he only wrapped his arms around her shoulders and it looked like the hug one would give to an old friend, to Ye Qingzi who always had an aura that repelled others a thousand miles away, this was more ambiguous. It was an action that also made her embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu who had just finished his battle would be the focal point of tens of thousands of people. Hugging her like this would undoubtedly give those people that enjoyed joining in on the fun the perfect reason to cheer even more!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, a wave of heckles, no less softer than their clapping reverberated around the Beast Fighting Arena as the beast fighter ultimately embraced the beauty!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly, let me go…” Ye Qingzi’s face was completely flushed red. Her beautiful and charming face carried bashfulness, fluster and a bit of impatience. She was so embarrassed she wished she could throw this fellow back into the Beast Fighting Arena. There were tens of thousands of eyes here. Ye Qingzi would have rather done this not long ago in the small black forest. She didn’t want to be so tightly hugged like this in front of this many people. In any case, she was a girl and no matter how calm she normally was, she felt ashamed and unable to show her face here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside her, Ye Wansheng raised his thumb and seemed to be taking delight in the disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Heng and Zhao Cheng were planning on congratulating Chu Mu, but when they saw this scene, they very tactfully stood to the side. They looked on in much amusement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan was about to stand up from her seat, but quickly discarded that idea. Instead, she used her pair of beautiful and spirited eyes to watch Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away. The corners of Princess Jin Rou’s mouth, under her veil, curved so that her mouth formed an arc. This subtle expression didn’t reveal the thoughts in her heart though.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even further away in the stands, Shen Yicheng’s face was unsightly. He waved his sleeves and turned around with a gloomy face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more a woman was unobtainable, the more a man with ambitions would want her. Personally witnessing Ye Qingzi fall into another man’s embrace, especially one who he had a blood vendetta against, made Shen Yicheng feel like his innards were going to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t allow others to see him lose his temper and calm. This would make him seem lacking in maturity, so he left the Beast Fighting Arena full of grievances.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Taking out all of his strength in the first realm… truly ignorant. I’ll soon make you understand how stupid you are. I’ll let you have this moment of pride for now!!” after he left, he muttered to himself in only a voice he could hear!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You still aren’t letting me go…” Finally, Ye Qingzi could no longer stand the scorching gazes of so many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was inappropriate for her to push Chu Mu away so she adorably stomped her small feet on the top of Chu Mu’s feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu felt pain, and thus released her soft and flexible body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jerk…” Ye Qingzi glared at Chu Mu with her face flushed in embarrassment. She looked very attractive and charming, and it made Chu Mu’s mind blank. After scolding him, Ye Qingzi didn’t dare stay on the scene any longer under the gaze of tens of thousands of people. Her face was red as she ran out of the Beast Fighting Arena. She seemed flustered and didn’t want to see others. &nbsp;</span></p>

You’ve got guts! A word of advice from a friend, Qingzi is even more scary than a tenth phase pseudo monarch when she’s upset. Chu Chen, you’re on your own here…” Ye Wansheng had a good laugh and patted Chu Mu’s shoulder. After speaking, the instigator broke into a stride and walked in the direction Ye Qingzi had left.</span></p>

He looked as if he hadn’t done anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

If there was no one present, or they had already left the Beast Fighting Arena, it didn’t matter if she hugged him. At most she would be embarrassed, but she would be willing in her heart.</span></p>

Messing around in front of tens of thousands of eyes, thinking of all those gazes, Chu Mu felt her body heat up and her pale white skin was even a bit pink…&nbsp;</span></p>

He thought that Ye Qingzi was mad he went up and hugged her. He completely neglected the situation problem, so even if he confessed he was rather impulsive, it would be of no avail. He could only scramble for things to talk about with as the ice-cold beauty healed his soul pets.</span></p>

There were also myriad people filled with confidence who had been even more battered and bruised by the first realm; only by expending all their fighting strength could they barely succeed in breaking through the realm. There were even many people who had tragically suffered losses or deaths while challenging the first realm’s honor.&nbsp;</span></p>
