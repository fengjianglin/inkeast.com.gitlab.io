 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Boundary Monument was still a distance away from Lin City. When Chu Mu embarked, he had Night run at its fastest speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took about a day before Chu Mu saw a huge expanse of land filled with overgrown wildlife.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for some reason, there wasn’t an inch of grass around Heaven Boundary Monument. Frigid wind and yellow sand danced around it together, preventing people from seeing where they were going clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The orange yellow sky was very high up. As the afternoon came, the sun hung on the horizon, casting long shadows. It was like a timedial that pointed to some time in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sand and long shadows, Night’s sleek body swiftly moved forwards. Its speed continued to grow faster and in an instant, it arrived under the Heaven Boundary Monument.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Boundary Monument was ground and tall. If one were to look up, it would be impossible to see the top.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless ancient words and vestiges of a watery moon were carved on the Heaven Boundary Monument. When one seriously stared at them, he would feel like a legendary scene of the past had appeared in his mind - one that was both deeply moving and soul resonating. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jumping off of Night’s back ,Chu Mu walked up to the Heaven Boundary Monument. He looked up and stared at the ancient stone monument.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, the Heaven Boundary Monument looked like an elder of time in Chu Mu’s eyes. This elder had many stories of the past and would always use profound words to convey them to people who understood him; yet, he would never tell them the full story.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Chu Mu had forgotten the Heaven Boundary Monument, it had used the Monument Tears to silently watch him. Then, when he had lost his consciousness, it had slowly told him of the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu would have this feeling at every Heaven Boundary Monument, including the one he was looking at now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked up and silently stared as he stood there, unmoving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hu hu hu hu~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow sand was drifting through the air. A drift of thin sand flew over, blowing against Chu Mu’s clothes and hair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The afternoon sun began to sink, eventually appearing behind Chu Mu, lengthening his shadow as well as the Heaven Boundary Monument’s shadow. Gradually, the human and monument shadows began to match up…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The time dial seemed to stop in this instant. The sand, earth and overlapping human and monument shadows all stopped. Another dimension of time and space unfurled itself like a scroll on the mirage-like earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world suddenly became silent besides the blowing sand besides one’s ear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu opened his eyes, he saw the Heaven Boundary Monument lonely towering on the boundless earth. Everything around it was empty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when Chu Mu’s mind was pulled towards a voice filled with magic power, Chu Mu suddenly realized he was standing in another dimension of time and space and was watching a scene from the past!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t feel surprised from the time and space change. His heart was very calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space around him began to illusorily warp. Sand still continued to fly through the air and the Heaven Boundary Monument remained standing by itself. However, in this new dimension of time and space, a great number of powerful figures had appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chasing was greatly exhausting. But, we ultimately caught up.” a voice emerged somewhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was able to see a Poison Teeth Beast. Its teeth were fully bared and took the shocking shape of arcs. These teeth resembled imposing horns filled with poison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red and black poisonous markings covered its entire body, making it look like a terrifying and malevolent poisonous bug lying on the ground. From time to time, it would twitch its body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground under its feet had been corroded. The power of this Poison Teeth Beast was far more than the four Chu Mu had encountered in the past. In fact, Chu Mu felt that even if he summoned all his soul pets, he probably wouldn’t even be its opponent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an immortal rank Poison Teeth Beast!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the back of the Poison Teeth Beast was a man standing on top of a black cloth. The man’s cheek bones were very protruding and his bulging eyes could clearly make others feel his insatiable greed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The words just now had come from this man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was currently standing where Chu Mu was. Chu Mu knew that he didn’t belong to this time and space and subconsciously looked behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">50 different species soul pets formed a defensive formation around the Heaven Boundary Monument. Each soul pet’s eyes was extremely resolute. They were staring at the enemies around them while also protecting something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Mu looked over, in the faint image, he was able to see a small and dainty girl. &nbsp;The girl was being held by a strong lion man in its arms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had never seen this lion man creature. It possessed a powerful humanoid body resemblant of the giant species. However, its head was that of a mighty lion. It had the intimidating aura of a king.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was very certain it was one of Ning Maner’s protectors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were wounds already on many locations of the lion man’s body. These wounds weren’t fresh. From the scarring and ulcering, they had probably been there for a long time already. However, they had reached their current state due to poison, dark corrosion, festering and not treating them for a while now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, the lion man had been fighting for a long time!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lion man’s eyes were an azure yellow color. Its arms were very thick and full of strength. They were something many powerful giant species members were incapable of comparing to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, these arms filled with destructive power were currently wrapped around the girl’s frail body. The girl timidly stuck herself to the lion man and her spirited eyes were filled with fear and unease.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Will we die?” the girl looked up and softly asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lion man’s expression was resolute and steadfast. It knelt down, but when its cold and emotionless eyes turned to look at the girl, they turned soft and warm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Image after image continued to appear around them. After surveying the scene around the Heaven Boundary Monument, Chu Mu discovered that it wasn’t only the black cloth man that had come to surround the creatures that had escaped from Quiet Forest. When he looked across, the surroundings were packed with people. There was no path of retreat for these 50 soul pets!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of enemies was ten times the number of these soul pets!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The over 1000 soul pets occupied the empty land around the Heaven Boundary Monument. On top of some of these soul pets were soul pet trainers. The eyes of these soul pet trainers were currently filled with excitement and greed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had chased all the way from the distant Quiet Forest in order to steal the Messiah Tree’s seed. Now that the Messiah Tree’s seed was in front of them, they only needed to get rid of these 50 obstructing soul pets and they would then possess strength that would allow them to look down on the rest of the world!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You know what to do. Go. For every Quiet Forest protector you kill, I will give you a great reward.” the black cloth man laughed. His two cheekbones seemed like they were going to pop out of his skin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thousand human and soul pets let out zealous roars. The scene of them charging forth couldn’t help but make Chu Mu suck in a breath of air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything Chu Mu was seeing was illusory. But the overbearing aura caused a wave of violent sand to crash at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor rank, dominator rank, immortal rank. Demons with naturally superior in speed, beasts with overbearing strength, fire types with stunning destruction power, lightning elementals. All of these powerful soul pets flew past Chu Mu, making it a war-like conflict. They were unstoppable and all wanted to kill!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deafening roar and the shaking earth caused Chu Mu’s consciousness to slightly slacken. With over 1000 humans and soul pets, how strong did the other side have to be in order to stop them?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On all sides there were soul pets approaching, but Quiet Forest’s creatures remained standing there, staring at the whipped up sandstorm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hou hou!!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lion man lifted his head and gave a roar, ordering his 50 underlings next to him to use their lives to meet the attack!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow sand covered Chu Mu’s surroundings, blocking his vision. He was only able to see in the final instant, the girl close her eyes and quiveringly hide in the lion man’s embrace. She refused to look on.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shouts, yells, roars and miserable cries…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sand grew thicker and thicker. Every so often it was possible to see a powerful figure jump into the beast group. Every so often it was possible to see some powerful figure fall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a big body collapsed right next to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fresh blood slowly flowed to Chu Mu’s feet, forming small streams of blood. The scalding blood expressed the unresigned nature of the creatures facing death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a dominator rank Ash Beast. Chu Mu remembered that it was standing to the front left of the lion man. It was probably a capable general of the lion man leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had fallen deep into the enemy army. Despite its powerful strength and shocking aura, it was ultimately unable to stop the besiegement from over 100 dominator rank creatures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were so many wounds on its body it was difficult to count. Chu Mu was presently standing in front of where the Ash Beast had fallen. Its head wasn’t even three meters away from Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within these three meters, sand would continuously fly up through the area. The illusory Ash Beast raised its head as if it could see Chu Mu in the other space time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It raised its head and looked right at Chu Mu. It just looked. But from its eyes, Chu Mu could read a lot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s heart had been touched, and Chu Mu truly found it hard to forget the Ash Beast’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its unwillingness; it was unwilling to have fallen like this. Its vexation; vexed why it was so weak. Its pleading; pleading to the unknown to come and save it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was just an illusory scene, it seemed so real!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s emotions fluctuated along with the battle’s intensity. In fact, he felt as if all this was happening right now. He wanted to summon his soul pet and transform into a devil to slaughter all of these people with insatiable greed. Not a single one should be left alive!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the past could never be changed. Despite the intense emotions and anger in his heart, Chu Mu could only silently watch. He could only watch as the tragedy unfolded before his eyes. Watch as the protectors fell one after another. And watch as the girl’s tears continuously flowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu closed his eyes. He suddenly remembered something Old Li had once told him: Every person would have something worth using their life to defend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing this scene, Chu Mu realized Old Li wasn’t necessarily referring to humans. In fact, he was including soul pets. There would be something for them to use their lives to protect. Even after they had fallen, they would regret the insignificance of their strength…&nbsp;</span></p>
