No matter which faction’s young expert it was, including the Soul Palace Young Masters, they all wished that they could see her legendary beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, Princess Jin Rou was the focal point of all the males in the hall. Regardless of where she went, it was possible to see numerous devoted and enamoured guardians.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Princess Jin Rou had already noticed Chu Mu. At the beginning, she didn’t know it was Chu Mu, but after remembering that in Wogu City, Chu Mu had taken the fake name of Chu Chen, and carefully checking, she confirmed that this changed face person was Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Chu Mu didn’t come up and greet her, Princess Jin Rou naturally wouldn’t run over there for so reason. Thus, after looking at him a few times and remembering his appearance, she continued to courteously cope with these restless young men.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Mu, it’s Shen Yicheng.” Ye Qingzi lightly pushed Chu Mu’s arm as she spoke to him in a soft voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Yicheng’s appearance caused Ye Qingzi to involuntarily quiver. She was clearly a bit afraid of this man still, especially encountering him at this location.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can hold onto me.” Chu Mu told her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi blinked her eyes and soon after understood his meaning. She, somewhat embarrassedly, stretched out her slender arm and grabbed onto Chu Mu’s arm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Yicheng walked over to Chu Mu, alone. His expression was normal. Perhaps to him, he and Chu Mu were already at irreconcilable positions, but at such an occasion, he would never allow others to feel that he was akin to someone who had lost his cool and was seeking a to carry out a vendetta by intentionally running over to the person who had harmed him to needlessly start an argument. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can’t reach the eighth realm, I’ll be very sad.” Shen Yicheng glanced at Ye Qingzi before speaking to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You soul has been restored?” Chu Mu looked at Shen Yicheng with interest and spoke to him in a provocative tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to worry about that.” calmly said Shen Yicheng. After speaking, Shen Yicheng’s gaze fell on Ye Qingzi again. With a mocking tone, he said: “Qingzi, are you relying on a faction or relying on a man? If it’s the latter, at least pick a man who is truly worth relying on.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to worry about that.” Ye Qingzi aptly used the words Shen Yicheng had just spoken to reply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trace of anger flashed across Shen Yicheng’s eyes. After coldly sneering, he turned around and walked somewhere else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An anger had already been ignited in Shen Yicheng’s heart. He had originally been amongst the strongest in the second grade and at such an occasion be sought after by numerous young generation members in attempts to get to know and curry favors with him; he would also be looked at by countless beautiful women throwing hints at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after that matter had occured, his reputation had plummeted. This could be clearly felt from the attitude the people around him were giving him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Yicheng was a person who could swallow his anger and would absolutely not lose his mind over this completely different treatment he was receiving. However, the feeling of being looked down upon by the people who used to curry favors with him was truly extremely aggravating. Thus, Shen Yicheng silently swore that in the Battle of the Realm, he would definitely make every person present today, who was deliberately mocking and looking down on him, regret this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu merely symbolically walked around the hall a few times before leaving with Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi didn’t like these sorts of occasions, because neither of them had participated in these social activities before while growing up. Instead, all their passion was focused on their own matters. To them, to be able to achieve success through different means and make friends with everyone was very hard. They were only willing to interact with people who they already knew.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s walk in the forest?” Chu Mu turned his head and asked a question to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Shen Yicheng left, Ye Qingzi had continued walking forward purely out of her subconscious mind. When Chu Mu asked her this question, she suddenly realized that she was out of it and stealthily relaxed her hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi nodded her head and followed beside Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They stepped on the soft leaves as they wandered around the slightly dusky forest. The two of them, neither of which enjoyed talking much, walked forward in silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Neither of them felt the silence was awkward either. They were both used to this feeling as if the two of them had been lovers for a long time already. Each was accustomed to the other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you struggle so hard to escape only to return here just to vie for the second grade’s honor?” after awhile, Chu Mu broke the silence by asking Ye Qingzi a question as he looked her in the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi’s eyes were very beautiful and Chu Mu enjoyed gazing into them. They emanated intelligence, tranquility and always contained a lustre of wisdom that could see the intrinsic character of something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reward of the second grade’s ultimate honor is a spirit item. This spirit item can instantly raise the the fighting strength rank of any soul pet regardless of its attribute. In truth, however, a trace of my teacher’s surviving thoughts was integrated inside this spirit item. It happens to be my teacher’s dying words as well as…” at this point, Ye Qingzi paused and didn’t continue speaking. Chu Mu looked at Ye Qingzi and from her expression, he could feel that the reason why she didn’t continue wasn’t because she didn’t trust him, but because it was her own secret not to be divulged….&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Mu, my brother and I will help you obtain the second grade’s honor. All of the other items will belong to you; we only want that item. Is that alright?” Ye Qingzi lowered her head and spoke in an very soft voice to Chu MU.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have continuously helped me control my soul temperature. My life is essentially in the palm of your hands and yours to command. How can I not agree to your request?” Chu Mu cracked a smirked and freely laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shameless.” Ye Qingzi looked at Chu Mu who was smirking. A slight blush rose on her cheeks and her beautiful eyes revealed a charming expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi inadvertently displayed a beautiful and flirtatious expression, causing his heart to beat a bit faster. He felt like there was a voice in his body telling him to use his arm and wrap it around this beautiful women who made one’s heart beat faster. It then told him to lean in closer to her face, before pressing his lips against her ice cold yet burning hot lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This voice carried a unique charm causing him to lose control of his own body. Yet, at the same time, there was another voice that unceasingly told him that if he did this, she would perhaps not reciprocate or feel it wasn’t right, or even tell him that he was rushing things… &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was clear about what sort of person he wanted, and didn’t enjoy forcing the issue on anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu glanced once more over at Ye Qingzi, and found that her head was tilted slightly down. She was clearly brooding over something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s obtain the spirit item for her first before speaking of this matter.” Chu Mu intelligently retracted his half raised arm, and continued to wander with Ye Qingzi in this small forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi really was brooding over something, but she had also noticed Chu Mu’s half raised arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi possessed the temperament to keep people far away from her and could resist all external things. She would thus deter all men who liked her and were vain for her. &nbsp;</span></p>

It was just as Shen Yicheng had said before: she couldn’t love a man in such a short period of time because with her temperament, it would inevitably be the case that she use time to test the person who she truly wanted.</span></p>

In any case, there were many people who were striving for the third grade honor, so putting a second grade expert as the first realm guardian was not giving others any chance to compete for the honor. &nbsp;</span></p>

Once the appraisal ranks were composed, they would form the Tianxia Ranking and would be published in the most conspicuous place in Tianxia Hall. Those who ranked the best, would receive rewards. &nbsp;</span></p>
