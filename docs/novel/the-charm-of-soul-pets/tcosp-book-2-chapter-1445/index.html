 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang and Sect Master Xiao were both the two great leaders of Divine Sect. It was not that their strength had surpassed that of Vice Sect Master Du Xian, but they were definitely not inferior to him in any way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Tang Ang was similarly a leader rank character. In addition to Xuan Gate Immortal School’s old sect master, Du Xian had requested five leader rank experts to gather here this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t this a little exaggerated?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Han Yan thought so in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of creatures that would require the leader rank individuals to make a move themselves are extremely limited. How can there be a creature that would actually require five leader rank experts to cooperate?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Yan had his own thoughts on this matter, but he still followed the intention of Vice Sect Master Du Xian regardless, personally going to invite Xiao Xueang and Sect Master Xiao. Meanwhile, he sent his subordinates to go and invite the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Han Yan left, Vice Sect Master Du Xian’s expression turned grim instantly. He could sense that the other side of the spatial passage was rapidly exploding. Even the Crowned Sun Lord did not possess such crazy tyrannical strength. Just what kind of creature was being forced to show up from the Imprint Valley this time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deploy the formation!” ordered Du Xian immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of ten phalanxes present, consisting of a total ten thousand Divine Sect experts. Three phalanxes began chanting an incantation simultaneously and summoned out their standard Curse Demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Curse Demon was an outstanding race known for its sealing ability amongst the demon type. After three thousand Dominator rank Curse Demons were summoned at the same time, countless pairs of deep blue eyes dotted the entire chaotic mountain, as if dazzling glitters had suddenly bloomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the Curse Demons began chanting simultaneously. Blue light rays shot into the sky. The sky transformed into a canvas and allowed those blue paint brushes to draw a huge diagram on it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light rays continuously criss crossed each other and a majestic blue barrier shrouded in the sky of the back mountains. The sharp lines and the light pillars were like threads and cages made for imprisonment, giving off an overwhelming pressure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vice Sect Master, why are you deploying such a large formation? Is another creature on the level of that Crowned Sun Lord going to show up?” asked Qin Guang as he raised his head to watch the grand formation that was created by three thousand Curse Demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xian did not answer him. While his expression was still grim, he was also very excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Xian could sense that there was a never encountered before powerful creature. It was clearly stronger than the Crowned Sun Lord, stronger than almost all the creatures that Du Xian had encountered before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could obtain that creature, then nobody would be qualified enough to compete for the position of the Divine Sect’s Great Sect Master with him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was definitely going to be an unexpected yet exciting harvest. However, Du Xian also knew that this creature which could explode the spatial passage was extremely strong. He had to prepare the best defense against it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam! Bam! Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space began trembling violently, some shards of the broken space swarmed out from the passage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody dared to stand close to the spatial passage anymore They backed off to the surroundings in a hurry and stood outside the dark blue barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three thousand Curse Demon barrier had started shaking. Those serious-looking Divine Sect guards and the Discipline Palace members were holding their breath and staring intently at the spatial passage without blinking an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The damage that the Crowned Sun Lord had caused had already left a deep impression within them. Now, an even stronger soul pet was going to be appearing before them, there was no way they could calm down knowing that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack crack crack~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like cracks forming on the surface of a glacier, the surface of the spatial passage began cracking. Everyone knew that the soul pet was approaching!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huhuhuhuhu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark wind currents surged out crazily from the spatial passage, chilling cold gusts of wind blew past everyone’s face. A soul-chilling coldness spread throughout their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was dawn, the rising sun was showering the land with its light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for some reason, the light was gradually dimming. The land was returning to darkness. When they raised their heads, they could see that the red rising sun slowly getting covered by darkness, gradually waning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So...... Solar Eclipse!” Qin Guang raised his head and stared at the sky in complete shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moon Tide, Solar Eclipse, they were naturally the most significant interchanging laws in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moon Tide represented the revival of all creations. Once Moon Tide takes place, the entire soul pet world would be in a state of a rapid population boom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Solar Eclipse represented the devastation and withering of all life. After Solar Eclipse takes place, plagues would spread rapidly and disasters would sweep the entire land. During the darkest periods, it might even be possible for all the races to go extinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans could deduce the pattern of the sun and the moon. They could accurately predict when the Solar Eclipse would occur. However, when the real Solar Eclipse suddenly occurs, when the bright day completely falls into darkness, nobody could endure the fear of the unknown!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, nobody could have expected that the Solar Eclipse would occur because of the arrival of a creature!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the entire city fell into panic due to the endless darkness, the space at the back mountain of Divine Sect trembled violently!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the spatial gate exploded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An enormous black figure descended from it like a demon lord. Everyone at the scene did not dare to look away, but nobody could tell what the creature that had appeared was exactly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eyes that seemed to embody the deep dark night contained within them cruelty, rage and disdain similar to a ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the natural aura of a lord and the dark tyranny that it was born with!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its aura alone controlled the rising sun and devoured the light bit by bit. This tyrannical darkness turned the bright sun into a black plate allowing the darkness of death, fear and apocalypse to shroud the entire land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The city had turned pitch black. Everyone in the back mountain of Divine Sect seemed to have lost their sense of sight. They could not see a trace of light within the dense darkness, let alone getting a glimpse of the outline of that creature!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t panic, maintain the barrier!” shouted Du Xian at everyone with his mental voice at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness and the unknown were the easiest factors when it came to breaking a person’s mind. Although Du Xian reminded all the Divine Sect members using a loud voice, even he himself was stupefied despite being a human leader!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of creature is this? How can it control the sun and change light into darkness at will?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Sect Master Du Xian did not know that it was not only Zhengming Main City that had fallen into darkness, but rather countless cities on Zhengming Continent had also experienced the same thing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a palace supported by chains on the Divine Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Mountain was constantly being bathed in holy radiance. However, once that creature descended, the holy radiance had completely disappeared. Only feeble light dots could be seen within the darkness now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Sect Magistrate stood on the roof of the Divine Sect Palace alone. He wore a long white coat. When the dark wind blew over, his coat fluttered freely in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He raised his head and gazed quietly at the darkness befalling this land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this fated, or simply a coincidence?” A woman’s voice muttered, soft and pleasing just like a tune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang looked to the side and stared at the woman in purple attire who had appeared unknowingly. Her actions were always unfathomable, even Xiao Xueang could not sense her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps both. Since the Solar Eclipse has arrived earlier, The Magistrate Palace is naturally prepared to fight,” replied Xiao Xueang with a stern tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You truly regard the world as your responsibility. Disaster and plague will spread throughout the entire Zhengming Continent and Wupan Continent. No matter how powerful the Divine Sect is, just how many can you quell in the end?” said that woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Until it all settles down,” said Xiao Xueang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you trying to bear the consequences of the evil deeds done by others?” asked the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You Hidden Pupil Royalty don't want to bear the burden, so us Divine Sect will naturally be the one to bear it,” replied Xiao Xueang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But the Divine Sect is also conducting an evil deed. Isn’t this Imprint Valley disaster conspirated by someone in the first place? If not for him destroying the Imprint Valley, how would the Solar Eclipse occur ahead of time?” said the purple-clothed woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueand did not answer. Divine Sect was not his alone. Divine Sect inherited the most noble will and possessed the most authoritative position. He believed that every person who entered the Divine Sect possessed a heart that was aligned to Divine Sect. However, human hearts would easily become twisted eventually. Du Xian was a respected powerful individual in the past. He had saved countless lives, but in the end he was unable to overcome the fear of death. Under the threat to his lifespan, he chose to fall into deprivation himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a mini Solar Eclipse,” said the woman solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know,” Xiao Xueang nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mini Solar Eclipse was the sign indicating that the Solar Eclipse would be arriving soon. Just like smaller waves sweeping onto the shore before the arrival of a large wave, once the small Solar Eclipse occurred, it meant that the real Solar Eclipse would be arriving very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Solar Eclipse was a natural law, it was unshakable. However, a mini Solar Eclipse could manifest due to the birth or descent of some creatures. What kind of creature could trigger a mini Solar Eclipse?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps, nobody could truly see the full appearance of that creature within this darkness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful, it’s really strong. Even after being sealed for ten thousand years, it still possesses a bloodline that is one of the most battle hardened ones,” warned the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang nodded. This was a disaster that was caused by others, but as the highest Magistrate of Divine Sect, he had to make a move. Otherwise, once the Divine Sect was flattened, Zhengming Main City would also be doomed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps because of possessing a natural born tenacious fighting spirit, Xiao Xueang did not feel fear when he was facing a darkness creature which could trigger a Solar Eclipse, instead he could only feel that his blood was madly boiling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the number one fighter of Divine Sect, Xiao Xueang could not remember just how many years it had been since he had last used his full strength in a fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman could not understand why Xiao Xueang would take responsibility for the entire Divine Sect or clean up the mess of others. Actually, Xiao Xueang didn't really mind using that as an excuse to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not a hideous and evil person, he did not become depraved due to that desire. However, he was also not filled with a stubborn sense of justice, the only true stubbornness he possessed was his constantly burning fighting spirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And to allow his fighting spirit to feel satisfied, the best method was to extinguish any and all conflicts under the name of Divine Sect!</span></p>
