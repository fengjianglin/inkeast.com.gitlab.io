 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Change names? There’s no need, right? Just continue calling it New Moon Land. It’s the most fitting since our territory is the shape of a new moon.” Chu Mu shook his head, and refused the senior elder’s senseless suggestions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, Chu Mu had the greatest contributions towards New Moon Land, and was New Moon Land’s undisputed king. The senior elders wanted to change New Moon Land to Chu Land in order to show reverence to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu felt no need for this. Although his surname was pleasant to look at and pleasant on the ears, New Moon Land was indeed more fitting for this territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of these major political affairs, Chu Mu didn’t have any interest in participating in them. He left them for Liu Binglan, Nightmare Emperor Jiang, Senior Elder Shen, and Senior Elder Pang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan wanted to utilize New Moon Land’s recent independence to spread its fame to various large realms and plant the flags of the palaces in other people’s territories.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that New Moon Land was a private territory, it was under the protection of Divine Sect. it was also overseen by experts, so it was a safe territory. However, New Moon Land could not remain sealed off from the outside world like the past. It had to continue developing. In order to do so, they needed to step outside of this territory to learn, interact, and trade with others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, I’ve walked through a large part of the Holy Regions, and the resources inside are much larger than I remember. There are even a few places I dare not enter.” Liu BInglan looked at the somewhat listless Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew that Chu Mu wasn’t particularly interested in these affairs, but since this concerned New Moon Land’s future development, Chu Mu had to participate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s a good thing.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a territory wanted to become prosperous, it was inextricably tied to a high rank bewildering world. If the Holy Regions held by Three Great Palaces were all high ranking bewildering worlds, then Three Great Palaces was essentially in control of a massive treasure house.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, as the strength of New Moon Land’s people increased, those lands of treasure that had yet to be encountered by humans would inevitably be dug out. This would increase New Moon Land’s strength as a whole again, creating a positive cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the most important thing was that New Moon Land had to have a strengthing interim period.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan indicated that the Holy Regions had distinct rank levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, those that wanted to probe these territories had to be at least of the dominator rank. However, due to the lack of dominator rank experts in New Moon Land, it would be difficult to find those that surpassed the low class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The low class dominator rank was a rank threshold that precluded New Moon Land’s people from exploring the depths of the Holy Regions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they could enable more people to cross this threshold, thus having more people to enter the depths of the Holy Regions, these depths in the Holy Regions would become a genuine hidden treasure. The experts that went to explore would have a very high chance of obtaining xuan items since in the past several thousand years, the depths of the Holy Regions had never been explored.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As far as everyone knew, this was a virgin land that was bound to have plentiful resources. This was the best catalyst for developing the entire territory!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, experts needed to clear the way for the Holy Regions, and the only people with this strength were Chu Mu, Mu Qingyi, Prince Chao, Ye Qingzi and Liu Binglan - this new generation of experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, aside from Liu Binglan, all of the others had unconfined and unrestrained hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mother-in-law, the Holy Regions are too big, and there are so many Holy Regions. There are only a few of us dominator ranks. Exploring them one at a time isn’t very practical. I feel that it would be more optimal for us to open our doors to experts from outside the realm instead of being unable to obtain the enormous hidden treasures at all…” Ye Qingzi saw that everyone was brooding over this as she promptly spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Opening our doors to outsiders? How is this possible? If they take the objects away, what will we do? In the recent period of time, I’ve been looking for books from beyond our territory to compare. I’ve discovered that their bewildering worlds with “plentiful resources” isn’t even one tenth of our Holy Regions. How can their bewildering world be considered rich? If it weren’t for us lacking experts…” Senior Elder Xiao was the first to refuse this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan was a bit baffled by Ye Qingzi’s words, but she didn’t immediately refute her. Instead, she looked at her, wanting her to continue explaining.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll give an example. We currently have nine dragon caves full of treasures. With our strength, it is impossible for us to get rid of the dragons guarding the caves, leaving us with only the small resources at the edges of the dragon cave. Instead of preventing anyone from obtaining the treasures inside the dragon cave, it’s better to allow foreign experts to come and help us get rid of the dragon cave’s guarding dragon. Then, we can share the treasures inside. Although we won’t obtain all of the resources, at least we will have a portion of the resources. These resources can be used to nurture our own experts… if we do this, we will be able to break the impasse we’re at…” said Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone came to a sudden realization after Ye Qingzi’s explanation. They felt this was feasible, but a few people still creased their brows because they didn’t want to share the treasure with everyone. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi saw that there were a few old people who weren’t particularly willing and faintly smiled, continuing: “If you think about it from another perspective, it should be easier to accept. We can view this as employing a few experts to explore the Holy Regions and have them explore the Holy Regions for us. We’ll be giving them rather high wages, but the ultimately profiteers will still be us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holy Region only had one exit, and when Chu Mu entered the Holy Regions back then, he hadn’t even been permitted to bring in spatial rings of soul capture rings. Moreover, once he exited the Holy Regions, he had to be searched. This would prevent the problem of selfish hoarding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, we can try this method.” nodded Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Ye Qingzi had said, defending property until one’s death was not as optimal as opening it up and sharing it with everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Also, we can also use this opportunity to recruit experts to join our palaces. For those that join our faction, we can for example lower the taxes on them. I’m sure that a few soul pet trainers pursuing the soul pet path will be willing to join us.” said Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few of the senior elders nodded their heads, feeling that this could create a positive cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, us folks are truly growing more stubborn and closed-minded. Thankfully, Soul Teacher Ye was here to wake us up…” laughed Senior Elder Pang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s method was accepted. In the forthcoming period of time, LIu Binglan would send a few people outside of their territory to establish palaces and lure experts with intentions of exploring the Holy Regions…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If experts were frequently coming through New Moon Land, this would naturally drive the composite strength of New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there was an even more important point. The Devil Souls had been residing now in Nightmare Holy Region for a long period of time now, and with Chu Mu and the other’s current relations with the Devil Soul species, they could have a few emperor Devil Souls sign soul pacts with experts that emerged from New Moon Land. This way, they could breakthrough the species restriction impasse. In 20 or 30 years, many dominator rank experts would probably emerge in New Moon Land!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu truly had no interest in the matter of development, and couldn’t suggest any good ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he returned to his palace courtyard, Chu Mu looked at the adjacent Ye Qingzi and couldn’t help but crack a silly smile and say: “I really didn’t know that you’re able to see things from a macro perspective. How about I abdicate from my position, and you become the Queen? Let’s have our Queen Ye lead New Moon Land on a prosperous path.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This was actually the plan of your slave…” said Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi often needed Yu Suo’s nurturing when concocting medicines, and would occasionally strike up a conversation with her. This queen that genuinely wanted to rule New Moon Land was very far-sighted. She had already made preparations for many of the current problems and matters New Moon Land encountered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just as I said. How could you think of these things?” Chu Mu suddenly understood and nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was Yu Suo’s plan, then it wasn’t strange. This woman probably actually did want to develop New Moon Land, using it as her cornerstone for expanding into even vaster territories.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi glared at Chu Mu and unhappily said: “So you’re saying I’m too dumb to come up with this suggestion?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh… yes!” Chu Mu cracked a toothy smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man still dared nod his head!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi bared her teeth and, like a small wild cat brandishing its fangs and claws, wanted to teach Chu Mu, this bastard, a lesson.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had just wanted to tease her, but Ye Qingzi had dragged him into the tiger’s den!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu gave a laugh and counterattacked in time, managing to pin her down first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ye Qingzi was pinned down by Chu Mu, she knew what he wanted to do. Her eyes showed a trace of bashfulness, but she bit her small red lip, and looked like she would firmly resist because of what Chu Mu had just said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t care, however, and taking advantage of the fact no one was around, would warm up first with Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu planted his wolf mouth on Ye Qingzi’s lips, but Ye Qingzi pursed her small mouth, not giving Chu Mu the chance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was still standing up against his actions!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that didn’t really matter. Ye Qingzi’s attractive parts weren’t limited to her soft lips and small tongue. Chu Mu began to kiss Ye Qingzi’s chin and white neck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s face instantly flushed red. This was still the courtyard, and if they kept fooling around and were seen by a servant, she would feel so embarrassed she would feel like dying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s fighting back was of no use. She begrudgingly gave a final request to at least go back to their room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had almost been half a year Chu Mu had spent training. Added on the matters after the territorial independence, it had been a while since he had gotten intimate with Ye Qingzi. Thus, this time lasted a long while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the aroma of love faded, Ye Qingzi’s beautiful face was flushed red and she asked Chu Mu a very adorable question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu gave a pensive thought before ultimately answering: “Either a boy or girl is good.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The problem of having a child wasn’t easy to talk about. He had been with Ye Qingzi for many years now, and had had many experiences in the bedroom. Ye Qingzi also didn’t try to not have a child. Thus, they should have had good news by now, but nothing had happened so far.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Chu Mu remember that Old Li seemed to have once said that higher ranked humans had restrictive reproductive abilities. Their chances of success were relatively low.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, it really wasn’t that significant that the chances of success were low. All they had to do was do it more frequently, and the problem would be solved! There were some things Chu Mu enjoyed and never got tired of.</span></p>
