 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s arrogant tone had caused Chu Mu to feel immense displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Does he not see the Martial Cloud Dragon that is just beside me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon was already way stronger than his golden snake dragon. Even if it had the assistance from his other soul pets, he would only be fighting on equal terms against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the meantime, Chu Mu would have also finished off his five subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the people from Snake Dragon Faction were indeed stronger than Hexfire, the low class Immortal rank White Devil was easily enough to take them all out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ao~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon proudly stepped up and used its enormous body to stand in between Chu Mu and the golden snake dragon. This stance clearly declared to Zeng Long that he had to defeat it first before taking on Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long was a very arrogant person, but the Martial Cloud Dragon was still a creature that he had to be wary of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Air currents that were on par with tornadoes kept getting blown out from the Martial Cloud Dragon’s nose. Rows of sharp dragon teeth also peeped out from its huge mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Zeng Long could say anything arrogant to raise their morale, the Martial Cloud Dragon had already gone forward and swung a strike with its claw on him to slap him right back into reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long didn't dare to clash head on with the Martial Cloud Dragon. He stepped back in irritation and glanced at his five subordinates, then shouted, “Finish off that brat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enforcer She was holding a grudge towards Chu Mu from the bottom of her heart and wanted to lynch him to death on the spot. However, after seeing Guang Ping getting easily taken out by that Black Nightmare in a mere few seconds, she harbored some fear against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Surround him!” Enforcer She did not step up herself and instead ordered the other four.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining four Snake Dragon Faction members were Zeng Long’s subordinates. So, Enforcer She did not really have any right to order them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four looked at Enforcer She in disdain, clearly unsatisfied with that woman ordering them around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they did not plan to slack off as Eminence Zeng Long had already issued the order. They had to execute the order given to them as soon as possible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All four of them rode on their snake dragons. Snake dragons of different properties and colors were rapidly flying around Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hissss~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snake dragons spat out their blood red forked tongues. Their large eyes were locked onto Chu Mu’s soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them clearly knew the power of White Devil and so they focused their attention on it, yet they were hesitant to make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the ground, Zhan Ye was not as patient as them. Its Brave Stinging Heart and Ancient Power Awakening would gradually fade away if it were to wait any longer. So it must fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye chose a six-winged snake dragon as its opponent and pounced towards it first!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six-winged snake dragon coiled around in the air and was over a hundred times larger than Zhan Ye. When it saw Zhan Ye pouncing towards its direction, it purposely lured Zhan Ye further up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six-winged snake dragon with wing property would gain plenty of advantage in a fight in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye simply stepped into the air and ignored the little tricks that the enemy used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grrrr!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye roared and shot its Dark Destruction Ray towards the six-winged snake dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large size of the six-winged snake dragon meant that it would not be agile enough to doge it. The Dark Destruction Ray blasted flat onto its body and knocked it far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going to swallow your soul pet whole!” cursed the soul pet trainer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, the six-winged snake dragon stabilized itself and opened its huge mouth wide in an attempt to swallow Zhan Ye whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The armor on Zhan Ye's body showed some changes. Instantly, sharp spikes sprouted over its entire body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six-winged snake dragon’s bite force was truly astonishing. It could easily crush most other armored creatures. However, when it bit down on the spike-armored Zhan Ye, its mouth ended up bleeding profusely and it cried out in pain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye was not going to give the six-winged snake dragon any chance to swallow it whole. After it punctured the mouth of the six-winged snake dragon, it immediately escaped the range of its bite. It hopped over onto the long back of the six-winged snake dragon, its claws dug rather deep into the scales of its body, tearing a gruesome bloody cut on its back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six-winged snake dragon twisted its body violently and tried to fling Zhan Ye off its body. It suddenly did a big sweep after Zhan Ye had lost balance, its tail heavily whipping on Zhan Ye’s body, denting a large chunk of Zhan Ye’s armor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye crashed into a mountain rubble. It climbed out of the rubble immediately and looked at its dented armor, but did not really mind it. This level of injury was nothing to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six-winged snake dragon was not really a weakling, it should be one level higher than a normal pseudo Immortal. Zhan Ye loved to face enemies that were stronger than itself, only in that way could it raise its strength even faster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu only took a glance at Zhan Ye who was filled with fighting spirit. He did not really need to worry about Zhan Ye too much. Even if there was one more snake dragon, they might not be able to triumph over Zhan Ye which could still continue raising its fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of the remaining four people, the woman with a snake tattoo on her face should be the strongest. He could tell that the Toxic Snake Dragon that was full of toxin on its entire body that she rode should be at low class Immortal rank. It was also her who had trapped the Martial Cloud Dragon in the Coiling Dragon Snake Formation with the cooperation of her subordinates before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“White Devil, you take on her Toxic Snake Dragon,” ordered Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Devil made a crescent smile. After receiving Chu Mu’s order, the arrogant White Devil simply ignored the other snake dragons and flew directly towards the Toxic Snake Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, White Devil triggered black Devil Fire and had it spread out all over on the black ground. The black Devil Fire that spread out looked like it was &nbsp;providing White Devil with an advantage similar to a domain. In this Devil Fire domain, Enforcer She’s Toxic Snake Dragon would be constantly suffering the burns from the Devil Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enforcer She did not back off this time though. Despite hearing about the fearsomeness of Black Nightmare before, she did not believe that she could not match this Black Nightmare which had forcefully boosted its strength using some unknown method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu noticed that Enforcer She was attempting to fight against White Devil alone and revealed a cunning smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That woman seems to have forgotten that this place was the Imprint Valley. The dark element and the instability of space allowed White Devil which had the Other main property and a dark sub property to gain an absolute environmental advantage here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Devil’s fighting method was particularly savage. It honestly did not seem to know the concept of defense. Facing the enormous Toxic Snake Dragon, White Devil kept recklessly unleashing technique after technique, not giving the Toxic Snake Dragon even a single moment to relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after the battle started, Enforcer She had noticed that the environment favored that Black Nightmare and it would be stronger here than her Toxic Snake Dragon. Furthermore, the toxin from her Toxic Snake Dragon would not really work on creatures like White Devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enforcer She chanted an incantation. She had more than one Immortal rank soul pet with her. Soon, a Seven-Headed Blood Snake appeared in front of her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its body was blood red in color. Blood was constantly seeping out of its skin and it dripped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven heads caused this Blood Snake to look even more menacing. Their necks twisted and entangled with one another, making it seem as if seven different snakes were entangled together and had fused their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven-Headed Blood Snake was similarly an Immortal rank creature. Its aura seemed to also be stronger than a normal pseudo Immortal rank creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Seven-Headed Blood Snake showed up from the diagram, its seven heads immediately spat out snake fluid at the same time and they sprayed it onto White Devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Devil tried to ignore it at first, but after noticing that the snake fluid was able to extinguish the Devil Fire on its body, it realized that this snake fluid was extremely dangerous. It hurriedly used spatial power to create a layer of protection around its body to ward off the snake fluid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Night, go help White Devil,” ordered Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night had preserved most of its fighting strength in the last battle. After seeing that Enforcer She had summoned another soul pet, he naturally was not going to let White Devil take on two enemies by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nie!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When White Devil saw Night appearing in its battlefield, it cried out in dissatisfaction, as if it was determined to take on two enemies by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Devil was very arrogant. It did not want Night to participate in its fight. Its black and silver interchanging body bravely stood tall in between the Toxic Snake Dragon and Seven-Headed Blood Snake, with black and silver energy rapidly interchanging in its palms!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Never mind, let it handle this on its own. Night, you take on the rest,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night nodded and immediately ignored the reckless White Devil. It casually strolled down from the sky and stood right in front of an Earth Snake Dragon which had a dragon body but with a long snake neck and a snake head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night chose it as its opponent because it was the strongest amongst the remaining three snake dragons. After going through a rich experience in the Demonic Burial Mound, the battle maniac factor within Night was completely stimulated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two snake dragons remaining now,” Princess Jin Rou took a glance at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Mo Xie had not joined in the battle now. Mo Xie had fought a rather tough battle against the Burning Nine-Headed Bird before and had not recovered yet from that. It would be difficult for it to take on two enemies by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo Xie, exhaust their stamina first, then let Ghost King take them on,” ordered Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie nodded in reply. Purple flames instantly enveloped its entire body. It transformed into Hades Fox Noble as it ran towards the enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was too difficult for Mo Xie to take on two enemies by itself in its current condition. So, it cleverly chose to conduct guerilla warfare instead. It kept leaping in between the two clumsy snake dragons, rarely clashing against them in a bout of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Mo Xie had exhausted the enemies to some extent, Chu Mu decisively recalled Mo Xie and summoned Ghost King next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monarch Ghost Transformation, attack!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ghost King manifested, the curved sword in its hand was instantly enveloped by a thick layer of ghost fire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its huge sword looked like a mountain. Once Ghost King’s gigantic body stood tall in front of the two snake dragons, the two snake dragons immediately looked a lot smaller.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One swing of the sword, and the two snake dragons which had attempted to attack Chu Mu were instantly swept away like rubbish, heavily crashing into the ground!</span></p>
