 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The late afternoon bright sunlight shone upon an immortal realm-like Divine Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Mountain was as serene as it normally was. Between the palaces, buildings, and halls drifted a holy aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuan Immortal Building was the place where Divine Sect’s Xuan and Immortal teachers would cultivate and concoct things. Normally, a thick medicinal scent could be smelled around the building, and beside the building were medicinal gardens and flower forests that emitted a delightful fragrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An azure flight of stairs faced the circular entrance. The circular entrance was lightly pushed open, and a slim and graceful but also sexually charming woman slowly walked out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sunlight washed over her body. It was as if it had been a long time since she had felt this kind of warmth as a smile rose on her face. She gave a light stretch on the azure stone staircase, exuding both grace and indolence. It was a gorgeous scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuan Teacher Ye, has your closed-door ended?” a patrolling Divine Sect male disciple’s eyes lit up after he saw the woman, and he took the initiative to greet her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you still calling her Xuan Teacher Xuan? You should be calling Immortal Teacher Xuan!” another senior disciple glared at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that was out of habit. Sorry.” embarrassedly said that male disciple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immortal Teacher Xuan is our Divine Sect’s youngest immortal teacher. We really can’t find many inner female disciples in Divine Sect who are as young, beautiful, and outstanding as you.” said the senior disciple with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi family smiled. Her smile was both gentle and warm, and showed no arrogance or gratification.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the young disciple saw Ye Qingzi’s reserved smile, he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. There really were too few female disciples in Divine Sect that were as strong, warm, kind, and with such a noble status. Of all the other inner female disciples of Divine Sect, which one didn’t have pride that reached the sky? These female disciples would rarely look at them let alone smile at the patrolling disciples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no wonder that there were so many members of Divine Sect chasing after Young Lady Ye these past few years. Where else could you find such an elegant, reserved and outstanding woman?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immortal Teacher Xuan, would you like us to notify Magistrate Xiao and the old sect master?” asked the senior disciple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone in Divine Sect knew that Young Lady Ye was the divine doctor that had saved the old Sect Master. The old Sect Master and Magistrate Xiao were extremely thankful for this and even if Young Lady Ye wasn’t herself a Divine Sect member, all of the members were extremely respectful to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No there’s no need to. It’s been too long since I’ve had any exercise. I’ll go for a walk.” Ye Qingzi declined the good intentions of these disciples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she leisurely walked down the azure stairs and breathed in the outside fresh air, Ye Qingzi felt much more refreshed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the past long while, Ye Qingzi had been in closed-door cultivation. This cultivation not only nurtured her own soul, but also had to do with her Immortal item concoctions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The repeated failures and wastage of expensive resources had brought her immense pressure during this closed-door cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she had ultimately succeeded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She concocted two Immortal items. Although the resources expended and wasted materials far surpassed the value of the Immortal items, as long as she was able to reach this stage, this meant that she could use the built-up experience to be even more proficient at refining Immortal items. Thus, her success rate would continuously increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first Immortal item Ye Qingzi concocted was a grass type Immortal item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t hesitate to use this grass type Immortal item to strengthen her Ardent Yang Pupil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s luck wasn’t bad. Although the quality of the grass type Immortal item wasn’t particularly high, she was able to strengthen her Ardent Yang Pupil to the immortal rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ardent Yang Pupil was Ye Qingzi’s refining cauldron. and an immortal rank Ardent Yang Pupil would greatly increase her refinement success rate. Ye Qingzi now had confidence to use Xuan items to refine Immortal items!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second Immortal item was an Immortal Ghost Stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ye Qingzi was choosing which Immortal item to refine, the attribute materials she had were wind, ice, main demon with secondary ghost, wood, and main rock with secondary ghost…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These attributes were refined according to the attributes of Chu Mu’s soul pets, because Ye Qingzi kept thinking about him. She wanted to refine an Immortal item that would allow one of his soul pets to enter the Immortal rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of these attributes that Ye Qingzi attempted to refine, only the rock main ghost secondary Immortal Ghost Stone was successfully refined. Ye Qingzi was very satisfied with this result because when Chu Mu arrived, she could give it to him and strengthen the Ghost King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When he gets the Immortal Ghost Rock, he’ll definitely be very excited.” as Ye Qingzi walked through the flower forest, and was quietly happy to herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi knew that Chu Mu’s cultivation speed was extremely fast. But she had to consider that there was ultimately an exceedingly difficult barrier to reach the Immortal rank, and adding on the fact Chu Mu had so many soul pets to strengthen, Chu Mu would still need a lot of help. Ye Qingzi had been away from Chu Mu these days, but was still doing whatever she could for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder what expression he’ll have.” Ye Qingzi muttered as she spoke. Chu Mu’s face appeared in her mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man always had a stoic expression, and was always acting callous. But there were times when he would mischievously laugh and act more improper than anyone she knew.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she walked along, Ye Qingzi already arrived in the depths of flower forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally when she was tired of refining, she would come here since this place had the same scenery as Xiangrong City when she was with Chu Mu back then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She remembered the petals floating through the air, and a flowery fragrance filling the gardens. That was also the time when Chu Mu had proposed to her when she was completely unprepared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many times when Ye Qingzi would be complaining to herself why she wasn’t able to remain patient and just easily agreed to what this man wanted. But everytime she thought of that scene, she would feel very sweet in her heart and she couldn’t help but smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this flower forest wasn’t as exquisite as Xiangrong City’s flower garden, the design was very similar. Every time she walked here, Ye Qingzi would reminisce.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Lady Ye, I knew you would be here. I heard that your closed-door cultivation ended today, so I came here to congratulate you.” a man strode forward and walked towards Ye Qingzi with an impressive aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi faintly creased her brows. She didn’t like other people disturbing her during this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man slowly walked forwards holding a bouquet of blossoming sun-like bright red flowers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sure that Young Lady Ye must have broken through your bottleneck. This bouquet of flowers has no other intention behind them other than to congratulate Young Lady Ye for becoming our Divine Sect’s youngest and most beautiful Immortal teacher.” earnestly said Han Erxing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi stood there but didn’t receive the flowers. She calmly said: “Thank you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing was Gate Master Han’s first son. Ye Qingzi didn’t have very good feelings towards Gate Master Han because he had colluded with the chief disciple of Xuan Gate to harm her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was without evidence, and ultimately couldn’t accuse them of anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had anger towards Gate Master Han, and didn’t have any good intentions towards his son either. His son would always come and bother her whether he had something to do or not; this made Ye Qingzi hate Han Erxing even more. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Han Erxing displayed a lot of patience and continued to hold the bouquet of flowers. He followed beside Ye Qingzi, and kept finding various topics of conversation to engage Ye Qingzi in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Han Erxing only had a good opinion towards Ye Qingzi. He liked women that were knowledgeable, beautiful, and elegant like her. But when he heard this morning from an older teacher that Ye Qingzi had broken through and successfully strengthened an Immortal rank Ardent Yang Pupil, this meant that aside from becoming an immortal rank expert, she was also an Immortal teacher!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Divine Sect was a sacred place where experts numbered as many as clouds, an Immortal rank expert’s status would still be incredibly high, let alone an Immortal teacher that could create Immortal rank experts!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing felt extremely regretful after learning about this information. Why didn’t he pay more attention earlier and take her as his own?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were able to marry an Immortal teacher as his wife, adding on his own strength, why would he have to worry in the future if he would possess authority over Divine Sect?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Han Erxing decided that no matter what, he had to take this young female Immortal teacher as his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to walk alone.” Ye Qingzi didn’t let this man stay beside her too long and frankly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing knew that he couldn’t be impatient with these women who had very indifferent hearts. Very wisely, he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi saw Han Erxing leave, and felt a bit unhappy inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi didn’t like wading in mud and water. Han Erxing’s goal was very obvious, and she had to think of a method to stop him from bothering her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, and Chu Mu still hasn’t come!” Ye Qingzi quickly felt a trace of unhappiness towards Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why hadn’t Chu Mu appeared for so long?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a huge number of narcissistic men in this world that would flaunt themselves in front of her. For instance, Han Erxing, who had rather high status. But Ye Qingzi found it awkward to ignore face and just tell them to scram.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had only walked a few more steps when she saw another man holding a bouquet of blossoming splendid flowers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bouquet of flowers was covering the man’s face and Ye Qingzi didn’t know who he was. As she saw him walk towards her, her brows creased again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man walked closer and closer while Ye Qingzi remained in place. For some reason, she felt that this man was extremely familiar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was sturdy, tall, and had a temperament that resembled the man who she was familiar to her bones with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, she realized something wasn’t right. As she watched the familiar figure who she often thought of fondly walking closer, her body looked like it was struck by lightning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I picked them up from Xiangrong City.” Chu Mu, wearing a smile, placed a bouquet of flowers that he had preserved for a long time in front of Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The longer they were separated, the more Chu Mu’s head was filled with Ye Qingzi’s figure. He would always think of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And when he actually saw her, Chu Mu would suddenly realize Ye Qingzi was even more beautiful and moving than he remembered. She was like a flower that quietly blossomed with her own beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you crying?” Chu Mu saw glittering tears in Ye Qingzi’s eyes, and hastily hugged her delicate and soft body into his arms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just a bouquet of flowers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But only Ye Qingzi knew that when Chu Mu, who wasn’t good with his words and didn’t know how to please people, appeared in front of her when she was thinking of him most and gave her a bouquet of flowers, this was a romantic gesture that overcame all their hardships.&nbsp;</span></p>
