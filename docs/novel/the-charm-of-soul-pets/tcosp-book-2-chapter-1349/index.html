 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding a quiet building, the two Border Lords brought a lot more people with them than before. Some of them were subordinates, while others were trusted aides and younger generation members that they wanted to train.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were still at the foot of the building, a woman that came with Border Lord Li Moyu said in a small voice to the man beside her, “Huang Yufei, who’s that one alongside Female Supreme and the two Border Lords?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know. I’ve never seen him before. Maybe its a younger generation person Female Supreme Liu brought, just like us.” Border Lord Huang Zefeng’s second son Huang Yufei said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great, we can bring him along to the Outstanding Experts Competition in a few days.” The woman said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You seem to be interested in him? Can it be that our princess Li Qingqing is finally enamored?” Huang Yufei laughed covertly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go away, I was just curious.” Li Qingqing immediately straightened her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two talked, Border Lord Li Moyu called them from the building to tell them to go up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them were from the younger generation. The older generations’ discussions rarely required them to be there. Telling them to go up was a certain form of recognition. The two of them were immediately happy and quickly walked up to the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qinging had great manners. When she went up, she told the servant girls to step down and personally helped the four of them make tea. Huang Yufei sat there dumbly, occasionally sneaking a peek at Liu Binglan as well as Chu Mu, who sat beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve heard of this slightly. However, I didn’t expect Territory Institution would split such benefits between every territory owner.” Liu Binglan nodded and finally understood the contents of this conference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Newly expanded territories are always full of resources. If all the territories clamored and fought for it, it wouldn’t be a pretty sight. Instead, we can use this method to peacefully and fairly split it. This is Territory Institute’s responsibility.” Li Moyu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, I have some questions. How was the north side expanded into? Wasn’t there a large soul pet dynasty there?” Chu Mu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Territory Conference was started due to new territory in the north end of Zhengming Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past year, a territory suddenly had a world-shaking fight that lasted a long time. The fighting caused the north side territory to rain blood for three consecutive months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t clear who started this terrifying killing, but the end result was that the territory belonging to the soul pet world was taken over by Zhengming Continent’s Border Army, which they quickly built defensive measures around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this summer, this territory would be permanently categorized as human territory. It would become a new large territory in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, before this territory was created, how would the resources within it be split?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the excessive slaughtering, it was already an ownerless land. The treasures that countless people used to seek was now there for anyone to take. No one wouldn’t feel attracted to this wealth, let alone give it to anyone else. Any faction with power in Zhengming Continent wouldn’t give this chance up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, New Moon Land was more or less uninterested in such matters, and wouldn’t participate. However, how would Territory Institute know they were uninterested? Now that New Moon Land wasn’t any inferior to many famous independent lands, it wasn’t polite to not invite them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such good benefits, people would laugh at New Moon Land if they didn’t come for a split. One had to know that the treasures in that territory could bolster an entire territory by themselves. Of course, more people would also question why a nameless small place like New Moon Land could also come for a share.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“North territory killing?” Chu Mu heard rumors along the way, but still wasn’t sure of what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know the situation well either, nor of any of the inner workings. I only know a lot of people died during this slaughter. It was an utterly malicious killing event….. Word is that a reaper that kills everyone on sight was born.” Li Moyu slightly lowered his voice when he spoke about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of a reaper, I heard from Yupan Continent that something happened in Quiet Forest again. A crazy devil used cruel techniques to kill seven immortal rank experts and hundreds of dominator rank experts. This is truly shocking news!” Huang Zefeng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“En, Zhengming Continent has a reaper, Wupan continent has a crazy devil. However, comparing the severity of the issue, Zhengming Continent definitely has it much worse. So many people died…… Ai, let’s not say too much. Zhengming is determined to push the news down and seal everyone’s mouths. We can speak about it occasionally, but the young ones have looser mouths. It’d be bad if we were convicted because of it.” Li Moyu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he said that, he specially glared at Huang Yufei and Li Qingqing to tell them not to say anything. They always ran off to their friends to show off whenever they heard about any interesting news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei and Li Qingqing were actually about to do just that. However, with the stare, their happy thoughts were all dismissed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingqing stared at Chu Mu and was somewhat jealous. Why did the two elders not glare at that fellow, and only glared at them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From what I see, the benefits of this time will be determined by the Outstanding Experts Competition.” Huang Zefeng brought the topic back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Outstanding Experts Competition?” Chu Mu showed his confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you not even know about the Outstanding Experts Competition?” Li Qingqing immediately took over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded sincerely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside him, Liu Binglan lightly explained, “It’s Zhengming Continent’s most authoritative younger generation competition. We told Mu Qingyi to compete for us. She was eliminated as she was entering the last round. In a few days there will be the Outstanding Experts Competition’s final battle. Those that stayed until the end represent the strongest factions of Zhengming Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What does this have to do with the territory in the north?” Chu Mu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Such a large piece of cake, how can we split it fairly without getting everyone angry? The best way is to tell all factions to send their best younger generation members to compete. The higher their rank, the more they get. The younger generation represents the next era’s strength. This is the most trustworthy indicator. Your New Moon Land Mu Qingyi entered the second to last match, and could almost reach the final battle. This means that your benefits will surpass us old territories by a lot now.” Li Moyu laughed helplessly as he explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ai, we can only blame our younger generation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he got there, Border Lord Huang Zefeng’s gaze suddenly fell on Chu Mu, and his expression shifted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Land’s young generation representative was Mu Qingyi, which to a certain extent meant Mu QIngyi was their strongest younger generation expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first, many people didn’t expect New Moon Land to even pass the initial bracket. Yet, Mu Qingyi had made it all the way to the second last battle, nearly eliminating an elemental sect disciple. This caused quite the ruckus in Zhengming Main City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, everyone subconsciously thought Mu Qingyi was the strongest of New Moon Land’s younger generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, today, they saw New Moon Land’s King, Chu Mu. This Chu Mu clearly was very young still. Being able to be the King meant that he was definitely stronger than Mu Qingyi. If he joined, wouldn’t that mean he would reach the last round?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their old territories’ representatives at most would reach the fourth level of the competition. Reaching the third level was already a great honor to their territory. Yet, how did New Moon Land have this many young experts? One Mu Qingyi had already surprised all of Zhengming Main City. Yet, the strongest young expert in New Moon Land wasn’t even Mu Qingyi. It was their King Chu, who didn’t even know what the Outstanding Experts Competition was.</span></p>
