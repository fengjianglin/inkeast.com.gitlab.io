 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The underwater battle was also very intense. As the battle progressed, the ice at the ocean surface was constantly getting shattered by those powerful water type techniques!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless pieces of ice floated above the ocean. Those finned ocean monsters with about one third killed by Chu Mu could finally enter water. They swam through the gaps between pieces of ice. Each time they flew up to the sky from the ocean, they would sweep up a terrifying wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those waves and water pillars tumbled into the sky and became lethal weapons under the control of those finned ocean monsters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Water type might not really be offensive. However, no creature could endure the constant impact from water energy. The skin would tear under such impact, the bones would creak, the stamina would be depleted again and again. Eventually, that creature would no longer be able to stand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had little experience fighting against water type creatures. What he could do now was to try not to let those finned ocean monsters enter the water. Their fighting strength after going underwater would be fifty percent stronger than in the air. This fifty percent was a significant increase to an army of a thousand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning did not stop its freezing technique. Once the ice was broken on the ocean surface, it would immediately freeze again. Ice flakes filled the sky above this rampaging ocean......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep underwater, mermaid princess led her Ocean Iguana Demon army and dominated in this deep sea battlefield. The claws of Ocean Iguana Demons tore apart the bodies of those evil ocean monsters. Blood flowed out from those ocean monsters and dyed the deep sea red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess remained at the center of the battlefield. She raised her face and spat out arcane-filled syllables between her dark purple lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once those syllables were transmitted into the ears of Ocean Iguana Demons, their scales would be strengthened and their wills hardened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when those syllables were transmitted to Calamity Ocean Demon’s ocean monster army, they felt a sudden powerlessness and could not exert their strength, as if they were hypnotized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ally was strengthened while the enemy was weakened. The Ocean Iguana Demon army became even more courageous. Those ocean monsters gradually became corpses and sank to the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“General Hai, I leave the rest to you here. I will take a look at the ocean surface,” said mermaid princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were over two thousand finned ocean monsters above the ocean. Their average strength was much stronger than the ocean monster army underwater. Mermaid princess was worried about Chu Mu not being able to handle so many alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess rode on a dark current to rise up to the ocean surface with two Ocean Iguana Demon guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ocean surface was still covered in ice. However, due to the intense battle, the ice split into countless pieces. The ocean water was exposed in various places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everywhere on the frozen ocean was dyed in blood and littered with finned ocean demon corpses. When mermaid princess arrived at the ocean surface while riding the tide, she was astonished to find out those two thousand finned ocean demons only had around five hundred still living. It seemed that the battle was also about to reach an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mister Chu,” Mermaid princess saw Chu Mu standing on a sharp ice mound far away and called out to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Ocean Iguana Demon guards behind mermaid princess immediately joined the frey to finish off the last five hundred finned ocean demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess rode on the sweeping tide and arrived in front of Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How’s underwater?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Underwater was the true territory of the Ocean Species. The underwater battle would naturally be even more intense than ocean surface. Chu Mu could already see blood dying up to the ocean surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are already doing the final clean up. Our response this time is rather quick. Calamity Ocean Demon probably did not gather enough forces to guard this island,” said mermaid princess. Then, she took a glance at the frozen battlefield and praised Chu Mu, “You and your soul pets are really strong. You killed them in such a short time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re only better at land combat......” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the ice surface was broken just now, those finned ocean monsters were able to swap freely between underwater and sky. This brought quite some trouble to Chu Mu and his soul pets suffered injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, once those finned ocean monsters dove underwater, Chu Mu had no method of killing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he was toyed with by those finned ocean monsters, he was even more determined to resolve the problem of being unable to swim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shashasha~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon completed its mission first. It flapped its wings and flew towards Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Little Hidden Dragon shrank its body, it became chubby. It seemed that it had filled its stomach in this battle. Its fat claw was stroking its belly comfortably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu inspected Little Hidden Dragon and noticed its blue color hue showing some changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the amount of souls Little Hidden Dragon devoured reached the stage for evolution, its would keep exuding this blue color hue until it completely digested the souls and evolved. Then, the blue hue would slowly disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Little Hidden Dragon was at the stage of digestion and evolution. It was clear to see that Little Hidden Dragon’s rank raised again and it was advancing towards low class Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spectral Dragon’s rank was already low class Immortal.In addition to Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s dual main property pseudo Immortal rank, this stacking of power was enough to make Little Hidden Dragon’s strength approach middle class Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no wonder Little Hidden Dragon flew around happily in front of Chu Mu after devouring the souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon completing this evolution, its strength would be almost on par with middle Class Immortal rank. It would surpass Night which was already in the lead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon’s talent and properties should be really decent amongst Chu Mu’s soul pets. In addition to its sick evolution method, it should be the one taking lead normally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, this little fellow was really spoiled and lazy. It rarely had a chance to take the lead amongst Chu Mu’s soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, by relying on its tyrannical soul devouring ability, it was finally able to take the lead for once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t get arrogant,” Chu Mu flicked this little fellow’s head with his finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst all his soul pets, Little Hidden Dragon was the laziest. Although Mo Xie would sleep all the time, it would become energetic once there was a battle. Currently, it was true that Little Hidden Dragon’s strength surpassed Night, but the other soul pets were much more hardworking than it. Once there was an opportunity, they would catch up really soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning for example, once it received Ning Maner’s nurturing after this battle, it would more or less reach low class Immortal rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu still had a middle class ice Immortal Item. After Ning was nurtured for a while longer and experienced more battles, Chu Mu would sue this ice Immortal Item to strengthen Ning. Ning’s strength would immediately surpass Little Hidden Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon scratched its head.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seriously, I finally managed to take the lead for once, can’t I show off a little?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mermaid princess was next to them. Seeing Little Hidden Dragon’s cute interaction, she let out some giggles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could tell that this human had an amiable relationship with his soul pets. Previously, mermaid princess heard that human’s soul pact was a type of slavery. Now that she witnessed such a scene, she knew that it was not always the case. Some humans never treated soul pact as a form of slavery, at least not the human before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Calamity Ocean Demon sent a force to attack our White Island, then the forces around Valley Ocean Trench would be lessened. Before coming here, I have sent an Ocean Species expert to Valley Ocean Trench. He should be able to bring back the Life Providence Grass Mr. Chu wants,” said mermaid princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was just troubled about this matter, but mermaid princess actually helped him resolve this problem. So he also felt grateful, “Thank you very much, princess.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have also helped our East Ocean. Oh right, I also have a name. You can call me Lan Qie,” said mermaid princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded and spoke, “I have a navy of about ten thousand men. They are all soul pet trainers. I will deploy them to this East Ocean region. They will assist you in subjugating Calamity Ocean Demon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy’s core thousand men were much stronger than the ocean monsters around White Island in terms of average strength. It should not be a problem for them to handle the elites of Calamity Ocean Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether Calamity Ocean Demon could be subjugated or not was also related to the survival of New Moon Land. Chu Mu naturally had to put in this effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the battle itself would be training for New Moon Navy. If they could foster an intimate relationship with the Ocean Species, the navy’s soul pet resources could also be obtained from the Ocean Species. Some open-minded Ocean Species might not mind signing a soul pact with humans. After all, this would increase the strength of both parties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That would be wonderful. I will let my younger sister communicate with your Navy leader,” Mermaid princess Lan Qie showed a beautiful smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There would surely be a difference in language between the Ocean Species and humans. So the Ocean Species would naturally send their agent, the mermaid, to communicate. Chu Mu wondered how surprised and excited New Moon Navy would be when they saw a living mermaid appearing before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You humans are good at analyzing the strength and weakness of various races. You also know how to make use of these strengths and weaknesses. You humans are more expertized in tactical knowledge than us Ocean Species. With your help, we are more confident in fighting Calamity Ocean Demon,” said Lan Qie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, analysis is a necessary study for us soul pet trainers. The growth, property, battle, strengthening of soul pets......” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This made me more curious about your human world. After this war against Calamity Ocean Demon settled, I hope I can visit your city......” said Lan Qie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Welcome,” Chu Mu nodded. His eyes accidentally glanced at those perfectly-shaped breasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ugh, though it’s welcoming. I have to tell this princess to wear some clothes. Otherwise, countless people will get a nosebleed after you reach the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the side, Ning Maner puffed up her cheeks when she saw Chu Mu and mermaid princess chatting joyfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They’re just a little bigger, what’s there to ogle about? Mine are also not small, I’m just wrapping them in dudou out of modesty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be what that mermaid princess said is actually true? Should I display my charm and beauty? If not, why is big brother so attracted to that naked princess? But it’s too embarrassing,” mumbled Ning Maner in her mind.</span></p>
