 <p>Resentment energy transformed into power, and raised White Nightmare another rank. The wounds of extinguished flames slowly were covered over again by the rampant flames nearby.</p>
 <p>Nightmare Ancestor no longer dared to fight from long distance. This was because its techniques also couldn’t cause lethal harm to white nightmare anymore, instead only wasting its meager stamina.</p>
 <p>Nightmare Ancestor casted devil phantom that caused its old body to drag out in the darkness with a string of afterimages. It swiftly yet unpredictably approached white nightmare!</p>
 <p>Devil phantom had very powerful dodging capabilities. Nightmare Ancestor didn’t hurry to attack White Nightmare, but instead constantly tried to lure white nightmare into attacking while avoiding them with its dominator rank dodging abilities to find a chance to land a decisive blow!</p>
 <p>White Nightmare’s surroundings were dancing with countless devil flame dragons, imposing and aggressive. When they moved around, it send rolling flames around to the surroundings. White Nightmare stood within it, mad and wild, completely disregarding Nightmare Ancestor’s methods and remaining in his own path!!</p>
 <p>“Huhuhuhu!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Devil flames morphed into a devil’s maw and suddenly bit down, devouring the swaying Nightmare Ancestor.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the nearby flames all dived towards it, as the maw threatened to devour everything!</p>
 <p>“White Nightmare, it’s behind you!” Chu Mu furrowed his brows and quickly warned White Nightmare.</p>
 <p>The devil flame maw had a spatial restriction within it. Once the opponent was swallowed, it was hard to struggle free, forcing the opponent to suffer in the devil flames.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Chu Mu didn’t expect that Nightmare Ancestor’s control over other type was also very adept. It could find a flaw in this technique instantly, and created a fake image to absorb White Nightmare’s firepower while it floated behind White Nightmare.</p>
 <p>Sadly, the Nightmare Ancestor didn’t know that Chu Mu and White Nightmare together made a half devil even more powerful than Nightmare Ancestor. Though White Nightmare couldn’t see through its tricks, Chu Mu could easily!</p>
 <p>White Nightmare smelled Nightmare Ancestor’s dark scent and suddenly stopped its technique. Its body burned with devil flames and swiftly disintegrated!</p>
 <p>“Sila!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>A devil claw extended from the darkness, ripping open a spatial gap where White Nightmare just was. If this claw fell on White Nightmare, it would definitely have left a massive wound!</p>
 <p>“Hu~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>A glob of pale silver flame silently started burning behind Nightmare Ancestor. The devil flames slowly constructed White Nightmare’s face full of anger and resentment. This face slowly was taken over by a cruel yet pleased smile!</p>
 <p>White Nightmare didn’t cast any technique, instead slowly moving its body towards Nightmare Ancestor. It extended a devil flame arm and started merging into Nightmare Ancestor’s body!</p>
 <p>Nightmare Ancestor was about to switch a position after its attack missed, but the old monster wasn’t nearly as nimble as it was at its peak. Tired from fighting, its actions were slower than normal.</p>
 <p>“Nie!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The Nightmare Ancestor suddenly let out a frightened call, because it felt that the young White Nightmare had started the devour technique on it!!</p>
 <p>Same species devouring!!</p>
 <p>White Nightmare had grabbed onto the White Nightmare Ancestor. Before the Nightmare Ancestor that was completely weakened, it forcefully casted this technique. This was equivalent to directly devouring the thousand year old monster alive!!!</p>
 <p>“Devour…...devour type White Nightmare, a royal member of nightmares!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing this frightening scene, old hermit yelled out!</p>
 <p>Emperor nightmare jiang, shen qiu, and old hermit’s soul pet were all royal White Nightmares with special abilities, but they knew that the strongest and scariest species ability wasn’t the ones their three noble White Nightmares had. It was the ability to devour other White Nightmares!!</p>
 <p>Devouring the same species to strengthen itself, becoming stronger the more powerful the White Nightmare devoured was!</p>
 <p>Thus, the old hermit didn’t even want to continue thinking about what would happen after it devoured the thousand year dominator rank Nightmare Ancestor.</p>
 <p>But one thing was for sure: devouring the Nightmare Ancestor directly was definitely even more beneficial than getting an inheritance!!</p>
 <p>“It really is devouring the Nightmare Ancestor??” Shen Qiu was watching it with his own eyes, yet he was still in disbelief!</p>
 <p>Over the past thousand years, Nightmare Ancestor had devoured countless same species. In fact, its offsprings in the past hundred years were all rendered into food to extend its life. It was a parasite through and through, completely devouring all life of its species…..</p>
 <p>Yet, now there was a young White Nightmare that started a devour on it, who had devoured countless other nightmares!</p>
 <p>“Nie!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Nightmare Ancestor let out a pained and angry cry. This cry was bleak and shocking. One could see its face becoming twisted as its facial features were burned through by devil flames!</p>
 <p>Nightmare Ancestor’s devil flames constantly changed color, sometimes becoming the old silver flames, sometimes raging with silver White Nightmare flames.</p>
 <p>Its burnt face was slowly being reconstructed with an appearance closer to Chu Mu’s. This was a sign that Nightmare Ancestor was getting devoured.</p>
 <p>However, both the silver devil flames that were popping up and the changing face of Chu Mu’s signified that Nightmare Ancestor was still struggling, and the state was very unsteady. Many times, there were even moments when the Nightmare Ancestor was completely overtaken by the White Nightmare. However, one angry call from Nightmare Ancestor caused all of this to vanished. This devoured body reappeared with Nightmare Ancestor’s old characteristics.</p>
 <p>At this moment, White Nightmare and Nightmare Ancestor’s soul were on the same body now and couldn’t be split apart anymore. This was completely a battle between the souls, a direct combat!</p>
 <p>In normal situations, Chu Mu would make White Nightmare heavily wound the opponent before they cast devour. This caused it to easily devour the opponent without being devoured in return.</p>
 <p>This time Nightmare Ancestor was just lacking in stamina but didn't truly get heavily wounded, yet White Nightmare still initiated the devour to eat the ancestor alive. This was an extremely dangerous move.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, as the Nightmare Ancestor let out painful cries, it started smiling nastily!</p>
 <p>Emperor rank devouring a dominator rank soul was like throwing an egg against a rock. At first, Nightmare Ancestor had part of it devoured but it quickly adjusted and, using its more adept experience with devouring souls, the old monster started turning the situation around, slowly eating White Nightmare and expelling it from its body!</p>
 <p>Maybe with continued struggling, Nightmare Ancestor would finally give up due to its weak life force and stamina. However, its soul is dominator rank. White Nightmare would ultimately become the food of this ancestor in this situation before that could happen!</p>
 <p>“Nienienienie~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Slowly, Nightmare Ancestor already took back over the body, changing gmost of the devil flames to the old pale white. Even its face was returning back to original. This caused Nightmare Ancestor to let out a pleased laugh!</p>
 <p>With such a young life, after the successful devour, Nightmare Ancestor could live ten more years!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu saw Nightmare Ancestor let out a pleased laugh and smiled.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu knew that White Nightmare’s aggravated devour was slightly headstrong, but since it already casted it, Chu Mu naturally would help White Nightmare complete this. Only in this way could it sate White Nightmare’s anger and resentment!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu casted an incantation and suddenly was engulfed in silver devil flames, almost instantly disappearing.</p>
 <p>Nightmare emperor jiang’s attention fell completely on the devouring White Nightmare, so no one noticed Chu Mu’s movement. They only saw the Nightmare Ancestor suddenly burst with a sprout of extremely bright silver. Soon after, a body similar to Chu Mu’s merged into the battle of souls.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu wasn’t completely a human anymore. His real life form was half devil. The half devil body was, in reality, the body chu Mu was in as a human. White Nightmare was actually just a subsidiary soul of Chu Mu now.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu could let the subsidiary soul White Nightmare fight alone, but under this situation, Chu Mu couldn't cast many techniques without being stacked with White Nightmare. It was like having a powerful body without a good weapon.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu didn’t let his weapon come back into his hands, simply using his own soul to dive into the fight of souls.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu’s soul was the main vessel for the half devil’s power, he had a far stronger soul than White Nightmare, not any weaker than Nightmare Ancestor’s.</p>
 <p>As long as Chu Mu stood there, Nightmare Ancestor would face the difficulty of trying to devour a dominator rank soul of a half devil!</p>
 <p>Thus, once Chu Mu joined, the Nightmare Ancestor could no longer laugh. Instead, its face was replaced with fear and shock, because it never expected a dominator rank soul to appear now!!</p>
 <p>If the Nightmare Ancestor could devour a dominator rank soul, its life span would definitely increase by a lot, possibly even returning it back to its former glory.</p>
 <p>However, if the old Nightmare Ancestor dared to bite Chu Mu’s soul, the only thing that would happen is its teeth would all shatter.</p>
 <p>“Think about how resentful you are, and rip its soul apart piece by piece to devour it!” Chu Mu said to White Nightmare said.</p>
 <p>“Nie!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>White Nightmare let out a crazy laughter.</p>
 <p>White Nightmare was so angry now that it could rip Nightmare Ancestor into countless pieces, stick them back together, and rip them apart again multiple times, and it still wouldn't completely sate it!</p>
 <p>On the other side, Nightmare Ancestor could no longer be pleased. Once Chu Mu’s soul appeared, the old thing was desolate. Feeling White Nightmare’s resentment and anticipating getting eaten alive, its soul was already shivering!</p>
