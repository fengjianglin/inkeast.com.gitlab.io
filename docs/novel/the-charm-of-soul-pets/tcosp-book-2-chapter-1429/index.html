 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You lots, don’t do anything reckless now!” Zeng Long turned around, and yelled towards Enforcer She and his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enforcer She and his subordinates naturally did not dare to make any form of movement. The huge black hole above them and the two spatial cracks were rapidly connecting. The direction it was spreading was not towards them though.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were to unleash any techniques and destabilize the space around them, then that black hole and the cracks might turn around towards them. They would not dare to conduct such suicidal acts no matter how dumb they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hole was still expanding further. The path that was leading towards the Light Valley had already been completely devoured. Only the path that was leading towards the Divine Sect’s entrance was barely safe for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The longer they stayed here, the more dangerous it would be for them. Chu Mu would not want to be buried here, but he also could not leave this place as there was a group of people flying towards him from that very safe direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked afar and realized that the person leading them looked familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the person approached closer to him, Chu Mu immediately frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t that the middle-aged man who was walking along with Gate Master Han? Based on the attire of those people behind him, they should be Divine Sect members. They’re either Han Yan’s subordinates or that Sect Master Du’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far away, Qin Guang also narrowed his eyes and examined Chu Mu who was standing next to the Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was honestly surprised. He had entered the Imprint Valley this time in order to obtain the Seven Sins Fox’s Monument Tear. He knew that the seal would be removed when this Imprint Valley enters a state of collapse. However, he had never expected that the Seven Sins Fox’s Monument Tear would be in Chu Mu’s hands......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was truly perfect. He just had to kill Chu Mu and then he could accomplish both his goals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, Qin Guang’s gaze turned to Zeng Long who rode on a golden snake dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long was rather famous in the Immortal rank community. That ugly dragon tattoo-filled face made it rather difficult not to remember him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s rather quick, hopefully it hasn't fallen into his hands yet,” mumbled Qin Guang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect and Demon Beast Palace were quite friendly to each other. If the item fell into Zeng Long’s hands, then Qin Guang would end up harming the relationship between the two factions if he tried to snatch it from Zeng Long forcefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, if it had really ended up in Zeng Long’s hands, then Qin Guang would definitely rob it from him. Compared to the value of the Monument Tears, that fake friendship was nothing. Qin Guang believed that if the situation was reversed, then Zeng Long would definitely do the same thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang did not bring many people with him, there were only four others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These four Divine Sect members were not exactly weak. Their attire made Chu Mu recall the Divine Sect guard who protected Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord Qin, perfect timing!” Zeng Long’s eyes brightened after he saw Qin Guang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Sect had plenty of Soul Devices. They could easily generate a net made of energy through energy transfer. It would easily be able to bind powerful enemies without the need to fight them. Zeng Long believed that Qin Guang must have brought such kind of Soul Devices with him. Otherwise, it would be very difficult to take on that powerful Seven Sins Fox.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eminence Zeng was probably hoping that I would come a little later,” said Qin Guang with a meaningful look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not at all......” Zeng Long truly meant what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hole above everyone was gradually getting closer and closer. Zeng Long no longer dared to use any techniques or it might end up luring the black hole closer to him. After all, the power of an Immortal rank could easily destroy space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did want to shatter the space around Chu Mu and the Martial Cloud Dragon, but if Chu Mu fell into the spatial black hole, then that Monument Tear would also be gone as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not kill Chu Mu, nor could he avoid a fight, yet he could definitely not let Chu Mu get sucked into the black hole. He was really at a loss at the moment. When he saw Qin Guang’s arrival, he was truly happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang had also noticed the slowly expanding black hole in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hole had already devoured one fourth of the sky. The huge void and the boundless darkness made one’s scalp go numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang knew what Chu Mu was capable of, but what use was it before the Divine Sect’s binding barrier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang silently signalled the four members behind him. The four Divine Sect guards rode their soul pets decisively to occupy the four corners around Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them started chanting simultaneously. Using their wind type soul pets as medium, creepy air currents gradually started manifesting all around. They looked like soft ribbons, as they gently weaved around Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of wind ribbons slowly increased. They weaved very fast into a binding cassock and wrapped around the Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon at first attempted to break free from the binding using brute force. However, its stamina had depleted to some extent due to the continuous battles. This wind cassock was soft in property and so it could not be broken with pure strength alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, the Martial Cloud Dragon’s body was completely wrapped up by the wind cassock. The Martial Cloud Dragon felt that its body was getting entangled in a sticky spider web. Although it could still move, there was always a kind of restricting force which prevented it from completely stretching itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind cassock did not end there. The second wind cassock flew out next and it immediately wrapped around Chu Mu’s Zhan Ye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye’s current strength was really close to a low class Immortal rank. Qin Guang sensed that this battle beast Mo Ye possessed some level of threat and immediately decided to bind it first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye could not struggle out of it either. The creepy wind cassock did not really possess a powerful restraining effect, but it was also very difficult to avoid it. The strands of wind kept fluttering around them, soft and intangible. Any sort of physical force could not forcefully dissipate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few incantations, Qin Guang and his subordinates had also applied the wind cassocks on Chu Mu and his other soul pets, restraining Chu Mu’s movement too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long seeing Qin Guang easily incapacitating the enemy that had given him a headache and he was immediately overjoyed. He spoke to Qin Guang, “As expected of senior Qin Guang, just some random incantations and this brat can’t do a thing already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just some random incantations? This is our Divine Sect’s Binding Cassock. It requires the cooperation from four top-notch Soul Devices and it expends Immortal rank soul crystals. Just the energy exhausted by those few Binding Cassocks is enough to create many Immortal rank creatures,” explained Qin Guang with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long had informed Qin Guang regarding the spatial collapse situation using mental voice before already, so Qin Guang knew that he could not use force this time. Hence, he ordered his subordinates to bind Chu Mu without any hesitation in order to avoid any accidents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The energy that was exhausted from the Binding Cassock was immense. Qin Guang would never be willing to use it normally. If not for the fact that he knew that the Monument Tear was with Chu Mu, he would rather attack Chu Mu personally than to expend those few wind type soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hand over the item now,” Qin Guang walked towards Chu Mu and spoke in an ordering tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang was able to bind Chu Mu’s soul pets with a few incantations, this had really surprised Chu Mu. It was no wonder that the Divine Sect could always maintain the most authoritative position in society. With such Soul Devices and Binding Technique, nobody would dare to make a racket before them. Qin Guang and his subordinates might not really be stronger than the Snake Dragon Faction, but if Chu Mu had encountered them first, then he might not even have had a chance to fight and would have lost immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hand it over now!” Qin Guang saw that Chu Mu was ignoring him and emphasized his tone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Divine Sect member, Qin Guang did not like to kill people. However, that did not mean that he really would not kill people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang had intended to push this brat into the spatial black hole after he obtained the item. Then, he would be able to finish both of his missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu calmly chanted the incantation to recall Ghost King into his soul pet space, then quickly chanted again to summon Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Desperate struggle!” snorted Qin Guang impatiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang signalled his subordinates once again. He was going to obtain the Monument Tear soon, so he did not really mind exhausting some more energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four Divine Sect guards and their soul pets chanted the incantation once again. Soon, the wind cassock made of many soft strands of wind slowly descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind cassock appeared to be slow, but it had a really strong adherence effect. No matter how great the soul pet was at dodging, it definitely could not avoid the strands of wind that filled the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the wind cassock falling down, Mo Xie did not attempt to dodge at all. Silver glint glowed on its claws and it rapidly swung its claw before the wind cassock could bind it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crescent light ray swept out from it and it cleanly tore the wind cassock into two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire wind cassock was a mini sealing formation. Once it was destroyed, the remaining energy would also no longer be maintained. Soon, the wind cassock dissolved into turbulent wind currents and dissipated completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Guang and the four Divine Sect guards opened their eyes wide in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They naturally knew the binding strength of the wind cassock as even the powerful Martial Cloud Dragon was unable to break free from it. However, this Fox Noble had easily torn through this wind cassock which was weaved by using a large amount of soul crystal energy......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Mo Xie broke the wind cassock, it swept its claw towards the Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silver crescent light ray flew past and the wind cassock fell off from the Martial Cloud Dragon too. After regaining its freedom, the Martial Cloud Dragon immediately roared furiously. It glared angrily at the four Divine Sect guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four Divine Sect guards turned pale instantly. The Martial Cloud Dragon was far stronger than them. If the wind cassock could not restrain it, then they were doomed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie rapidly dashed around and freed the other soul pets. After regaining their freedom, the soul pets returned to Chu Mu in order to avoid getting trapped by the enemy’s schemes again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This......” Zeng Long saw that the opponent had easily broken free from the restrain and intended to stop it. However, the Martial Cloud Dragon raised its claw and threatened to tear this region of space if they dared to approach any closer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon’s power was unfathomable. If it really swung its claw, then it would definitely generate a terrifying spatial black hole. If that happened, then nobody could escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, Qin Guang’s expression darkened immediately!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My soul crystals, these wind cassocks used Immortal rank soul crystals! They got easily neutralized by that brat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, I’m going to kill you!” shouted Qin Guang angrily and was ready to ride on his soul pet to attack Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord Qin, please don’t be impulsive!” persuaded Zeng Long as he noticed the situation worsening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Qin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else changed their expressions. They really wanted those Divine Sect guards to apply a wind cassock on Qin Guang and restrain this old bastard who might end up killing everyone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou and Chu Mu stood on the opposite side, unable to hold back their laughter after seeing this bunch of people panicking.</span></p>
