 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter looked at Luo Yi and coldly laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Crown Horned Devil stopped attacking space, and its cold eyes focused on Luo Yi’s Water Devil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the Crown Horned Devil disappeared from its place. It quickly passed through a gulch-like sunken space and the single horn flashed with a cold light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cold light transformed into an abstruse sharp sword that pierced towards the Water Devil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Water Devil’s mountain rampart ability was very weak. It brandished its tentacles in an attempt to knock away the Crown Horned Devil, but the single cold sword light was faster and it pierced the Water Devil’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pu chi!!!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strange paste began to splurt out as a hole appeared in the Water Devil's head. It looked ghastly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Yi and the other navy members were stunned by this scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Yi’s Water Devil was very strong. They fully understood this. However, in front of the Crown Horned Devil, it couldn’t even withstand a blow!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Crown Horned Devil seemed to know that the Water Devil, as a water type elemental creature, wouldn’t die even after its head was pierced. Thus, it used its crown horn to lift the Water Devil up into the air and fiercely throw it into a deep fissure next to it! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Yi watched his soul pet be thrown into the death fissure and abruptly came back to his senses. He angrily said: “Don’t think you’ll get off easy! Die together!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, three long tentacles shot out from the fissure and rapidly wrapped around the Crown Horned Devil’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Luo Yi’s Water Devil was being devoured, its three tentacles were able to display astonishing pulling force as it dragged the Crown Horned Devil into the death zone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t only Darkness Sect’s people that would engage in mutual destruction. When Luo Yi saw that his favorite pet was going to die, he went a bit mad.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman standing next to Heaven Slaughter creased her brows, and hastily chanted an incantation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Heaven Slaughter shook his head. He indicated that she didn’t need to do anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shua!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, three sharp blades appeared without warning, slashing where the tentacles were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The long tentacles were easily cut by the sharp blade. After being sliced apart, the tentacles were quickly pulled back into the fissure, falling with the Water Devil itself into a place where there was no chance of survival!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flesh on Luo Yi’s face violently twitched. This area clearly only had his Water Devil and the Crown Horned Devil. Where did the three sharp blades suddenly come from?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mutual destruction situation had become a situation where only his Water Devil had died. This pushed the anger in his heart to a maximum. Even while his soul was wounded, he forcibly chanted an incantation and summoned another soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, did you see it?” softly asked Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I only saw a blurry shadow. It was extremely fast, and it’s adept at hiding in space,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had been watching the fight between the Crown Horned Devil and the Water Devil. Just as he thought the former would be dragged by the latter into the deep abyss, a lanky and skinny creature suddenly jumped out from space and used its claws to rip apart the Water Devil’s tentacles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing this attack, this spatial creature suddenly disappeared and hid itself in some corner of space. Even Chu Mu couldn’t sense where it hid itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected, he does have an other type soul pet. It was no wonder he dared to so wantonly break space,” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t say anything, but his heart was a bit heavy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter had yet to attack him, but that didn’t mean they were friends. If he decided to destroy this area of space in one breath and bury both him and the navy, Chu Mu would have great difficulty in taking the Martial Cloud Dragon and breaking free of the chaos space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Chu Mu could see that the other type creature that had extended its hands in a flash was extremely strong. Chu Mu wasn’t even sure if the Martial Cloud Dragon was its opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I had a feeling that there was something hiding around us. Could it have been that other type creature that just attacked?” asked Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ya. He probably doesn’t want to let us flee.” Chu Mu nodded his head as he rapidly tried to think of how to deal with this situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seven Sins Fox’s Monument Tear was in his hands and obviously, these people were here for it. Its Monument Tear probably hid some great mystery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect and Snake Dragon Faction’s people could leave, but if he tried to strut away, Darkness Sect’s people would definitely stop him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, since Divine Sect’s Qin Guang had left through the spatial passage, he would definitely dispatch countless Divine Sect members to defend Divine Sect’s back mountain exits. The moment he exited, he would be taken away by Divine Sect’s people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They suddenly stopped fighting,” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu glanced at the navy members and then at the Divine Sect members. He suddenly understood something and said: “They didn’t stop fighting. Rather, they want to bury them alive.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he finished speaking, all of Darkness Sect’s people had their soul pets launch an attack at the navy. Their target wasn’t the navy’s soul pets, but instead the surrounding space!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hong hong hong hong hong!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dark energy loudly exploded and piece after piece of space was peeled off. Deep fissures began to terrifyingly spread as black colored spatial holes appeared one after another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The navy’s members did everything they could to neutralize Darkness Sect’s techniques. However, no matter how much they neutralized, this area of extremely weak space was no longer capable of supporting spatial unrest. Thus, the area the navy was standing on began to rapidly sink as mud, rocks, and mountains were all pulled into unknown chaos!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The area Chu Mu and Princess Jinrou were standing on was only lightly shaking. A few cracks managed to spread to them, but at least the ground they were standing on hadn’t instantly collapsed into the chaos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw space swallow the navy members and their immortal rank soul pets, the feeling they got was like standing on the edge of a cliff and watching others fall off. As they watched their bodies slowly shrink before finally being devoured by darkness, it was unknown whether they hit the bottom of the abyss and were smashed to pieces, or if they had fallen into another unknown dimension… &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from Ocean Lord Ji Gui, who used powerful strength to break free of the spatial suction, Luo Yi and the other three Ocean Lords fell into the endless abyss of death as expected. They completely disappeared from this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they fell, their faces that were full of fear made those who were watching feel trepidation. If it had been them that accidentally fell in, what would it be like?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Gui stood at the edge of the spatial fissure, and his eyes seemed like they were spitting fire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heaven Slaughter, you won’t be able to escape! Just wait for your death!!” angrily said Ji Gui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, this Navy Ocean Lord turned around and flew towards Divine Sect’s back mountain exit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect’s back mountain exit was already covered by spatial fissures. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to cross through; however, Ocean Lord Ji Gui ostensibly knew a bit about the spatial dao and wasn’t pulled into the fissures. He successfully managed to reach a safe zone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One managed to flee.” Young Lady Si watched Ji Gui gradually flee into the distance and spoke somewhat unhappily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter.” Heaven Slaughter seemed to have already guessed this would happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about them?” Young Lady Si pointed at Chu Mu and Princess Jinrou with somewhat cold eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness Sect’s people had a slaughtering temperament. This included Young Lady Si.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring them with us.” Heaven Slaughter glanced at Chu Mu and Princess Jinrou and indifferently spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t kill them?” asked Young Lady Si.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t kill them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon had been through multiple fights. Its physical strength had been greatly consumed. It knew that these humans could find an exit out of Imprint Valley. Therefore, even if Chu Mu was being brought away, it still followed him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Lady Si saw that an extremely mighty Martial Cloud Dragon was following and wanted to drive it away. However, since Heaven Slaughter didn’t say anything, she wouldn’t make it difficult for Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Princess Jinrou were currently surrounded by five Darkness Sect members. If they so much as thought of fleeing, the five members would instantly take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why didn’t they seal our soul remembrance?” Princess Jinrou used a mental voice to communicate with Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It means they may not have intentions of getting rid of us,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Chu Mu didn’t understand why this Darkness Sect expert didn’t want to seal his soul remembrance, it meant that it was still possible to turn the situation around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, Senior Heaven Slaughter probably doesn’t have any harmful thoughts towards you. Don’t make any drastic actions.” Leng Lou used a mental voice to tell Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. The moment he discovered that something wasn’t right, he would stake it all. He couldn’t let these Darkness Sect people manipulate him as they pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, there’s a large fissure in front. There’s no way around it.” a scout flew back from afar and knelt with one knee in front of Heaven Slaughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter nodded his head. He didn’t say anything and had his subordinates continue to follow him forwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scout didn’t leave. He joined the team and looked at Chu Mu as he asked Leng Lou: “He’s the person with the Seven Sins Fox Monument Tear?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Lou shook his head, indicating that he didn’t know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Darkness Sect scout’s question reminded Chu Mu that Heaven Slaughter was a Monument Tear Individual. He could definitely feel that he had the Monument Tear on his body, so why wasn’t he telling him to hand it over?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were Chu Mu, after capturing an enemy, he would definitely first take the treasure from his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He obviously knew that the Monument Tear was in his hands, but had no intentions of taking it; nor did his eyes have the greed the previous people had. Could it be that Northern Territory’s slaughtering devil was a genuine Monument Tear Individual? Perhaps all he needed was a bit of knowledge of his Monument Tear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps this is the case.” Chu Mu felt that this explanation made sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Chu Mu couldn’t believe that he was completely safe either. Darkness Sect’s people did strange things and were hard to predict. Perhaps they had let him live for another purpose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu continued to maintain his vigilance. If Heaven Slaughter harmed him, Chu Mu could only take Princess Jinrou and the Martial Cloud Dragon and jump into a spatial black hole. He would rely on his control of other type energy and break free from Darkness Sect’s people before finding an exit.&nbsp;</span></p>
