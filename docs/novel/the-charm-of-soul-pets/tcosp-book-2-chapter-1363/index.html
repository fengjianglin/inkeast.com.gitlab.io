 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The meaning of Tang Ang’s words could not have been any more obvious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was &nbsp;fine for all of them to attack him together all at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forget about accepting any challenges, he had even put forth such an arrogant request!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire venue was stirred up. Not only those younger generation experts who were in the spectating seats, even the Immortal Rank experts were also affected by his request. They had never seen such an arrogant man before in their lives!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the top of the Floating Mountain Battlefield, Chu Mu had noticed everyone’s hostile glares and the curses being shouted rumbled like thunder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t he just a disciple of a Yue Lei? What’s there to be so arrogant about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Land? It's just a tiny private territory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a direct provocation to all of us. Even if we could not enter the finals, we aren’t that far behind in strength from the top eight. He’s really looking down on all of us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Various young outstanding experts who were staring at the Floating Mountain voiced out their dissatisfactions. They were raring to charge their way into the Floating Mountain to beat that arrogant guy into an utter pulp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu also knew that he had incurred the public's wrath. He was cursing Tang Ang in his heart for landing him in such a troublesome position!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Ang must be doing this on purpose!” Liu Binglan frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Obviously,” Yu Bo sighed, “What he did undoubtedly is him wanting to create trouble for Chu Mu, and also to damage the reputation of our New Moon Land in the process.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother seems to be in trouble,” Ning Maner muttered worriedly to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi nodded. That Tang Ang must be doing this on purpose. Even the final eight participants would not dare to have the courage to challenge all the unconvinced youths all together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s opponent, Guo Shi, took a step back from him and took on a spectating role.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the participant seats, Tang Zhuo, Xin Xin and Han Erxing watched the events unfold with a completely mocking attitude. This situation was purposely arranged by both Tang Zhuo and Han Erxing together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unknown and insignificant brat dared to challenge them? Even if they were going to fight with him, they had to let him suffer a bit first. This was their territory, they would not tolerate having a clown being so arrogant in front of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps we won't even have the need to make a move,” Tang Zhuo laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You made &nbsp;special arrangements?” asked Xin Xin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo shook his head and pointed to Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing revealed an evil grin on his face and whispered a few sentences to Xin Xin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what he said, Xin Xin raised his brows slightly and showed an interested smile. He then mumbled to himself, “Hehe, this arrangement should really be interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fenxue was sitting next to the three of them. She keenly glanced at the three and was guessing whether they had a part to play in this again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo, Xin Xin and Han Erxing had always been close friends/acquaintances. Once someone whom those three could not stomach appeared in the Zhengming Main City, they would thoroughly torture the person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the start of the Outstanding Expert Competition, there was a participant who had the potential to enter the finals. But because he offended them, that young individual did not even get to pass the selection match. His five souls were heavily damaged and it was not known if he was still alive or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fenxue felt utterly disgusted by watching the three of them abusing their authorities. However, there was nothing she could do to them. Even if there was concrete evidence, nobody in Zhengming Main City could hold them accountable. The strength and the background of those three was too solid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fenxue shook her head in disappointment and took a glance at Chu Mu who fell completely into their trap. She sighed, “Showing off &nbsp;just after entering Zhengming Main City......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stood on the Floating Mountain. Countless angry stares were focused on him from the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not avoid it. Tang Ang had clearly made things difficult. If Chu Mu backed off, it would be tantamount to surrendering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then come,” said Chu Mu bluntly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what if I accept? Perfect timing, I was just in need of something to vent some frustration!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took his stance and stood calmly on the Floating Mountain Battlefield, &nbsp;not afraid of anything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me come then! Hmph, the type I hate the most are the disciples of some of the powerful individuals. Putting aside that identity, you yourself are worth nothing in my eyes!” a rough voice roared out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A robust man jumped up from among the spectators onto the Floating Mountain Battlefield while standing atop a colorful Demonic Centipede.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With someone taking the lead, more youths had joined the fray. They were mostly participants who were frustrated after getting poor rankings in the competition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, more than over a dozen figures appeared on the Floating Mountain Battlefield. They were all members of the young generation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many floating rocks on the Floating Mountain Battlefield. Chu Mu stood above a sharp and tall rock, standing all alone by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the other challengers had spread out on various other floating rocks. Some even rode on their wing type soul pets and looked down on the white-robed Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re also going? Don't you see that there are already 15 people on the battlefield?” an Elemental Clan member stopped his companion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why should I not? He’s looking down on all of us too much!” complained the Elemental Clan member who had wanted to join the challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The count was still rising rapidly. In a short duration, there were already over 30 &nbsp;challengers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the number of challengers had reached 30, the people joining the fray had finally slowed down. If the number increased any further, it would mean nothing even if those furious challengers won.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The breathtaking scene of 1 vs 30 had probably never appeared before in the Outstanding Expert Competition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was clear to see that the strength of the over 30 &nbsp;challengers were uneven. The crude man who stepped out first was the strongest amongst them. He should be someone who had advanced to the third rank elimination match. The colorful centipede he stood on was at peak Dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we want to convince him of his defeat, we should summon only one soul pet to fight against him first,” commanded the crude man as if he was the leader of the challengers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were so many of them challenging. If they summoned out all their soul pets at one go, there would be over 150 soul pets in the battlefield. There would be no point in continuing such a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m fine either way,” Chu Mu showed a sadistic grin on his face and focused his attention on the leading man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Arrogant!” the leading man was furious. Even the final eight participants might not dare to be so arrogant in front of him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So what if you’re strong? It’s all because of your backing. Let this great me tell you something, strength is not determined by rank alone!” argued a young man standing behind the leading man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, this kind of person only relies on the endless supply of xuan items. Let us teach him what a true battle is!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Tang Ang had announced that Chu Mu was Yue Lei’s disciple, those outstanding experts who reached their levels without any no backing or support were triggered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were angry and frustrated at the unfairness of the world. To them, they believed that they could be even stronger than Tang Zhuo and the others if they had such formidable backgrounds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each line that Chu Mu said would &nbsp;end up being swallowed by the rage of those young soul pet trainers. Perhaps they were not only just unconvinced of Chu Mu’s sudden participation in the finals, but a large portion of their dissatisfaction was probably their rage towards people with good backgrounds like Chu Mu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of their intent, Chu Mu did not care either way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He just wanted to fight till he was satisfied, the more people he could fight the better!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, are you ready?" Tang Ang looked down from high above with a look of interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That cunning old fox had cleverly guided the fury of the entire venue onto Chu Mu, while he remained completely calm as if it was unrelated to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have something to say,” Chu Mu looked at Tang Ang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must be scared. Get lost if you’re afraid,” scolded the leading man immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost! Don’t tarnish the rules of our Outstanding Expert Competition!” shouted &nbsp;someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu ignored the curses hurled at him, and coldly spoke to all the challengers, “I don’t know how to hold back at the last moment during battles. You can use your killer moves on me. Likewise, I also won’t hold back against anyone who challenges me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not want to dissuade those who valued their lives, but he just wanted to tell them that he was a merciless man!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These youths had a hard time cultivating up to their current level. Please hold back if possible, King Chu......” Old Sect Master Xiao had finally opened his mouth at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Sect Master Xiao could actually sense the evil aura emitted by Chu Mu. Such a youth must be stained in the blood of countless people. He had especially emphasized that he would not be holding back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Sect Master Xiao did not wish to see too many people dying due to Tang Ang’s provocation. His intention was simply to ask Chu Mu to hold back if it was within his means.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, every person has to be held responsible for their own actions. You can be haughty and you can be reckless. However, reckless actions have a price to pay. I want to ask all of you who have stepped up to the challenge, are you prepared to pay this price?” questioned Old Sect Master Xiao calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Old Sect Master had spoken at that moment to warn those youths who were incited by Tang Ang's provocation, due to this they might not only be manipulated by others due to a moment’s impulsiveness, but they might even get their soul pets killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took a glance at the Old Sect Master of the Divine Sect. He knew that the Old Sect Master had intended to cover for him and sober up those incited people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were indeed many people who had stepped up due to a moment's impulsiveness. However, they were similarly in a tight spot. They could not just step down at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, you may begin,” The Old Sect Master waved his hand, signalling the main referee to announce the start of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu must have gone crazy. Forget about the challenge, he’s even going to start a massacre?” said Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s really crazy. This may result in our New Moon Land antagonizing all of them,” said Shen Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That may not be the case at all. It may even end up promoting our reputation. Currently, our New Moon Land actually doesn’t have to be afraid of offending others. We have a small territory anyway, whoever comes doesn’t need to go back!” said Prince Chao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi watched Chu Mu facing the crowd of challengers and felt perplexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s behavior was abnormal, very abnormal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He who usually kept a low profile was really showing off too much this time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi did not know why he suddenly let loose his anger. Was her recent attitude towards him really affecting his emotions that much?</span></p>
