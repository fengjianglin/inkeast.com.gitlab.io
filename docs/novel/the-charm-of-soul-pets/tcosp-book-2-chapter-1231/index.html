 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were directions on the monument, informing Chu Mu of where that ancient beast soul had once gone to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu saw the ancient beast soul in the memory drawing placing the item on an enormous island. He vaguely described the appearance of the island to Old Li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Demonic Burial Mound! It’s definitely the Demonic Burial Mound!” immediately shouted Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li had been to Demonic Burial Mound before. Chu Mu’s description of it&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Li, you probably remember how to get to Demonic Burial Mound, right?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The directions Old Li had given Night were to Demonic Burial Mound. As a nomadic demon, the Demonic Burial Mound was Night’s holy land. Chu Mu was certain that after so many years, Night had found Demonic Burial Mound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was about time to reconvene with Night. Chu Mu thought of Night a lot. It didn’t matter if he had to find the item that was capable of subduing the ancient snake person, Chu Mu had to make a trip to Eternal Ocean regardless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was very frank when he did things. Having made his decision, he made slight preparations before leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Princess Jinrou returned first to Wanxiang City to tell Liu Binglan about what they encountered in Wind Palace.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This shocked Liu Binglan and the senior elders. They never expected that New Moon Land had such a long and powerful past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After informing them, Chu Mu planned on immediately heading to Eternal Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Eternal Ocean was a troublesome place, because Chu Mu didn’t have a water type soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could fly through the air, but there was no land under him. This was a vast ocean and if he were accidentally dragged down to the ocean, his fighting strength would be greatly reduced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Chu Mu’s half devil form and Mo Xie were both of the fire attribute. If they encountered a creature of the same rank in Eternal Ocean, they would be countered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He needed to go with a water type soul pet trainer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recently, many soul pet trainers from outside their realm had been attracted here. Among them, many wanted to obtain xuan items in the holy regions. There were also many middle class dominator rank experts who were very interested in New Moon Land’s resources and planned on staying here long-term.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Cloud Gate’s old man overseeing Wanxiang City, Chu Mu didn’t need to worry about these foreign experts causing a rebellion. Even if they did, the dominator rank experts that were slowly begin to emerge from Wanxiang City and the emperor rank army weren’t just there for display.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through Liu Binglan’s recommendation he found a free soul pet trainer called Sang Ying who was a water type expert and was planning on wandering to Eternal Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying was from He Border from a young age, liked the ocean and water type soul pets. He had traversed oceans countless times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Sang Ying had come to New Moon Land not for the holy regions, but instead for Eternal Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Traveling by oneself was extremely boring. Although Sang Ying, who spent most of his time proud and aloof, was used to this, he still found it better if someone else was travelling with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Sang Ying had extremely high requirements for a team member. If they would drag him down, he would rather travel by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Sang Ying arrived in New Moon Land, Liu Binglan had made him a temporary guest under her goodwill. Before Sang Ying came, he had heard that this Female Supreme from New Moon Land was quite remarkable. When he actually got the chance to see her, she was indeed incomparably beautiful and had an outstanding temperament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t expect Liu Binglan to suddenly recommend him to travel with her son in Eternal Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Sang Ying learned Liu Binglan was a mother, his mood greatly dropped. Nonetheless, he wasn’t someone overly attached to women. His true target was Eternal Ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying also didn’t think that the person Liu Binglan recommended to him would be to his satisfaction. Perhaps he was just an inexperienced brat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello, I am Sang Ying.” out of courtesy, Sang Ying politely examined Chu Mu and then amicably extended his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook his hand and said: “Have you been to Eternal Ocean before?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying shook his head and said: “I’ve been to the other oceans many times.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, as long as you’re familiar with oceans.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? It can’t be that you’ve never been to the ocean before, right?” Sang Ying raised his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I haven’t.” Chu Mu didn’t think that his time on Nightmare Island counted as going to the ocean before. The ocean was unimaginably vast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying forced a smile and glanced at Liu Binglan. As expected, Liu Binglan wanted him to bring a mere brat to train.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once we go out to the ocean, you must listen to everything I say. The danger of the ocean far surpasses dry land…” Sang Ying was helpless, but he could see Chu Mu was a spirit dominator. If he wasn’t a spirit dominator, Sang Ying would have refused to bring him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had zero understanding of the ocean. In front of a specialist, he would naturally listen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also have three friends I want to bring.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Three. How strong are they?” asked Sang Ying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are all spirit dominators.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After getting to know one another, Chu Mu did as Sang Ying wanted, and brought a few pieces of equipment required for the ocean. Then, they planned on embarking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they all convened in Wanxiang City’s large plaza, Chu Mu introduced the other three to Sang Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is Chao Lengchuan, the Palace’s crown prince.” Chu Mu pointed at Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan had just come out of Thousand Wave Holy Region, and his power had greatly risen. When Chu Mu asked him what rank he was at, this fellow had gone so far as to hide it from him and keep him in suspense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After bitterly training for nearly a year, Chao Lengchuan’s main pets had probably gotten much stronger. He had probably also obtained great benefits in Thousand Wave Holy Region. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be all full of smiles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is Xia Zhixian. A support soul pet trainer.” Chu Mu pointed at the mature and beautiful woman with an incredibly elegant bearing standing next to Prince Chao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Zhixian’s appearance had surprised Chu Mu. It wasn’t until recently that Chu Mu found out that Prince Chao had gone with Xia Zhixian to Thousand Wave Holy Region. With her help, he had managed to charge into the depths of Thousand Wave Holy Region. Xia Zhixian’s help was indispensable to obtaining the benefits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The initial punishment for Xia Zhixian had been house arrest in Xianrong City for three years and to serve the city. It was a rather light punishment. After careful consideration, Liu Binglan had pardoned her and let her serve the Palaces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Zhixian was loyal to Yu Suo, and now that Yu Suo had been submitted by Chu Mu, Xi Zhixian obviously needed to be tactful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xia Zhixian and Prince Chao seemed really close to each other now. If they had some secrets that they weren’t telling others, he would have to find spare time to grill Prince Chao about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo’s rise in strength meant that Xia Zhixian had also obtained benefits. As a support soul pet trainer, Xia Zhixian had very strong supportive abilities. Moreover, she had a water type soul pet which lessened Chu Mu’s lack of water traversing problems.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you say there were three people? Where’s the last one?” asked Sang Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When many people are present she won’t appear. Just wait and you’ll see.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu summoned the Dead Dream. Everyone jumped on its back, and they flew out of Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark purple lightning phoenix was basically the trademark of Chu Mu’s identity. WhenDead Dream that Chu Mu was riding on took to the skies, the ten thousand people in the plaza all looked up and let out cries of exclamation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s King Chu’s Phoenix!!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The person on top is definitely King Chu!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I knew that person felt familiar just now. If I knew it was him…” said a few people in remorse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was always elusive in Wanxiang City. It was difficult for even the higher-ups in the Palaces to see Chu Mu, let alone normal people. Therefore, when Chu Mu took to the skies from the plaza, this caused no small commotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying looked down and saw the zealous citizens in the plaza. A while later, he finally looked back with shock at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the King Chu - Chu Mu that made New Moon Land He Border’s only independent territory?” Sang Ying abruptly realized this and cried out in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I thought you already knew…” Chu Mu forced a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh… it was my disrespect.” Chu Mu wiped away the trace of dissatisfaction in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying really hadn’t realized the young man in front of him was New Moon Land’s King!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a legendary man that was able to beat all of a seventh rank realm’s experts and also became a topic of conversation in all of He Border for his achievements. Sang Ying had to restrain his arrogance no matter how proud he was. Indeed, compared to this man who had astounded the entire border territory, as someone who had just traversed the oceans, he was nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu actually didn’t know how far his name had spread.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead Dream had already reached the middle class dominator rank, and its flying speed was quite fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason the Dead Dream reached the middle class dominator rank was thanks to the recruitment Liu Binglan did of those dominator rank experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Phoenix xuan items were not easy to find and when Liu Binglan learned that one of the foreigners had a phoenix xuan item, she immediately spent 3000 xuan to purchase it. She then gave it to Chu Mu who was finally able to raise the Dead Dream to the middle class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Regions were being continuously excavated right now, and Three Great Palaces were gradually obtaining control over many resources. Their xuan items had also stocked up a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, there were 20 dominator rank experts from Wanxiang City while there were about 30 from outside the realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps 50 dominator rank experts wasn’t a lot, but being the result of only one year, this was already very rare. In a few years, there would probably be many more dominator rank experts from Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides a phoenix species middle class dominator rank xuan item, Liu Binglan had also collected a third rank ice type xuan item and a third rank rock type sub-ghost type xuan item for Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two xuan items had resolved Chu Mu’s low class dominator rank problems for the Ice Air Fairy and Ghost King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the time before Chu Mu set off for Eternal Ocean, he raised the Ice Air Fairy and Ghost King to the low class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu still had the fifth rank wing type xuan item, fifth rank ice type xuan item, and fifth rank dark type xuan item from Wind Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Binding Wind Spirit’s training percentage had reached 100 percent so Chu Mu just had to pick a good time to strengthen it and it would reach the middle class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning’s training percentage was still zero. But he probably would need the Ice Air Fairy for many of the fights in Eternal Ocean. Thus, it would probably reach the middle class dominator rank soon.&nbsp;</span></p>
