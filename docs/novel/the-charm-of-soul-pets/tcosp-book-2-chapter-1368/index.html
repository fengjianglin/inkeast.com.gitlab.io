 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four limbs that were covered in armor seemed to have started bulging. The black ancient tattoos, the blood red berserk transformation and the dark soul shadow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three powers had transformed Zhan Ye into a tiger of massacre filled with unparalleled strength. Its ice cold pupils directly stared at the Aerial Listening Devil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The energy released from the Ancient Power Awakening started coursing through Zhan Ye’s body. Zhan Ye took a step forward and started walking on air as if it was walking on the ground. A spatial shockwave spread out as it took that step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Power itself was almost overflowing from its entire body. Zhan Ye’s aura had completely changed after experiencing another full recovery. Its attitude towards the Aerial Listening Devil was filled with disdain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye raised its head and a dark destructive light surged out from its throat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grr!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dark Destruction Ray shot out. The Aerial Listening Devil had no way of dodging it while it was still being sealed by the dark shackles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demons had fairly weak defenses. When the Dark Destruction Ray hit the Aerial Listening Devil, it was completely blown apart. Pieces of its flesh were scattered all around and it's bodily fluids sprayed all over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An astonishingly deadly ray had bloomed above the sky of the Hovering Mountain Battlefield, directly striking the hearts of a lot of the spectators along with the Aerial Listening Devil’s death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another soul pet had died, and this time it was He Zhen’s soul pet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people could still remember the great performance of He Zhen using his Aerial Listening Devil, as it received plenty of applause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right now they had just witnessed it getting blown up into pieces, not even leaving behind a complete corpse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen was utterly shocked, as he watched his Aerial Listening Devil falling down as several pieces of flesh absentmindedly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not showing a shred of mercy, Zhan Ye had used it's killing move instantly. He Zhen was just pitying Han Qi’s Heaven Eye Toxin Beast getting killed a moment ago. Now, he was not any better either, as his Aerial Listening Devil was blown into pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The death of two soul pets did not deter He Zhen and Han Qi's determination, they were possessed by fury!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Incantations rang out, they had summoned their soul pets almost simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two peak Dominators immediately appeared on the battlefield. As they were completely overwhelmed by rage, they did not care whether their peak Dominator rank soul pets could be of any use in battle right now. Their only aim was to kill that battle beast Mo Ye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rage had clearly clouded their eyes as they did not realize that Zhan Ye’s strength had raised up by another level. Its current strength was two levels higher than the paragon Dominator rank. If it could use its full strength to attack a paragon Dominator, then that paragon Dominator would either die or suffer a very heavy injury!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fang Corpse Emperor was fighting it head on, while the other three soul pets were madly unleashing their techniques being influenced their masters’ rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye’s sixfold life force was rapidly multiplying while it was strengthening itself. Even if it just stood still there and allowed the paragon Dominator to keep attacking it, there would be no problem for a short while!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye’s target this time was the Fang Corpse Emperor. The corpse poison from the Fang Corpse Emperor had greatly hindered Zhan Ye’s self healing ability. If Zhan Ye could finish it off, then Zhan Ye’s life force recovery would turn even more terrifying. The damage dealt by the peak Dominator rank soul pets might not even be able to catch up to its self recovery speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhan Ye is really strong. After going through five Broken Limb Rebirths, it has completely dominated the battlefield. Those paragon Dominators are already not its match,” exclaimed Prince Chao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Say, if Zhan Ye uses the Broken Limb Rebirth one more time, can't it advance into the Immortal rank?” asked Pang Yue as she stared at the battlefield without any movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi, Ning Maner, Shen Mo, Mu Qingyi and the others were all sitting together. Pang Yue’s question had also triggered their curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It should be one level away from the near Immortal rank, while about two to three levels away from the pseudo Immortal rank. According to the current situation, it should not be a problem for it to advance into the near Immortal rank. As for whether it can reach the pseudo Immortal rank, that’s really hard to tell,” Ye Wansheng was the first to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng was the real disciple of the Cloud Gate Elder. The Cloud Gate Elder had often told him about the Immortal rank, so he was more knowledgeable about the difference in strength than the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s plenty strong enough already. These people...... Sigh, I can only say that they don’t know their place,” said Prince Chao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye’s strength had become a whole two levels higher than the Fang Corpse Emperor. Even if its healing ability was restricted, it still had its beast property and the dark property. Each technique that it unleashed could cause a decent level of damage to the Fang Corpse Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Zhan Ye’s fighting method was rather savage and merciless. Under it's consecutive attacks, the Fang Corpse Emperor kept getting pushed back and had clearly fallen into a disadvantageous position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye was still forcing it back, riddling it with holes &nbsp;using the Ink Armor Spikes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fragmenting Stamp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black warhammer descended from the sky, blasting right onto the Fang Corpse Emperor’s body. The Fang Corpse Emperor’s bones were thoroughly shattered into smithereens and its body had turned into a puddle of mud!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Crush the corpse, don’t let it get up again!” ordered Chu Mu mercilessly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Corpse type creatures were almost impossible to kill. They could hide their corpse life source in any part of their body. As long as their corpse life source was not crushed, they could stand up again and again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu obviously could not tell where the Fang Corpse Emperor hid its crucial heart. So, the simplest method to kill it was to simply crush its entire body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching its current level of strength, Zhan Ye’s power could only be described as a merciless tyrant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Chu Mu had issued the order, Zhan Ye transformed into a black crushing mountain, with a dark shredding storm lingering around it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other soul pets tried their best to intercept Zhan Ye, but their feeble bodies were easily swept away by the shredding storm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black crushing mountain dropped straight down. As he was witnessing such a scene unfold, Han Qi’s face lost all color and he shouted in panic towards Chu Mu, “S...... Stop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu snorted. Did he show any mercy when Zhan Ye was on the verge of death just a moment ago?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu ignored Han Qi’s desperate screams. If he did not teach them a heavy lesson, then any random person might come to find trouble with him. There would be no way he could make a name for himself on Zhengming Continent if that happens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he chose to flaunt his power, then he would flaunt it to the end. He would flaunt to the point where the enemy standing before him would fear his mere presence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Booom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The merciless crushing mountain had landed. There was no chance for the Fang Corpse Emperor to survive this blow. Its corpse flesh was completely squashed into meat paste, flowing down from the steep Hovering Mountain cliff disgustingly......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another soul pet died without an intact corpse. Zhan Ye had displayed its absolute tyranny to prove its glorious position as the strongest Dominator rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stepping over the mud-like corpse, Zhan Ye’s calm yet cruel gaze was locked onto Han Qi’s other paragon Dominator. That paragon Dominator was a thunder type Fairy. Zhan Ye had no chance of getting close to it in the previous battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the current battlefield, there were only a few peak Dominator rank soul pets of Han Qi and He Zhen left. In Zhan Ye’s eyes, they were not even worthy to be its opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi was scared. That fear had seeped into the depths of his soul along with the cold gaze. After getting two of his most powerful &nbsp;soul pets killed, Han Qi had fallen into an ice cold abyss. There was no more rage in his eyes, but complete and utter fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi’s face could not be anymore paler, he had endured the pain and had forcefully chanted the incantation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he even lost that thunder type Dominator, then he would no longer be able to hold his ground in the Zhengming Main City. Facing off against such a crazy tiger of massacre, he had already completely lost the courage to keep on fighting!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Zhan Ye did not prevent the thunder type Fairy from escaping. There was no meaning in killing an enemy that had already lost its will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi continued chanting and recalled the other remaining soul pets back into the soul pet space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even paragon Dominator could not escape death against it, so leaving the peak Dominator behind was plain suicidal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen looked at Han Qi dumbfoundedly. Just as he was about to say something, an intense mental blow caused him to spasm intensely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen immediately turned around and realized that the creepy Spectral Hidden Dragon had appeared behind his Snow Feather Devil out of nowhere. The sharp dragon horns had pierced right through the Snow Feather Devil’s head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood flowed down the dragon horn onto the Little Hidden Dragon’s head. The Little Hidden Dragon opened its mouth and directly swallowed the Snow Feather Devil’s soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul of a paragon Dominator immediately allowed the Little Hidden Dragon to grow up by thirty percent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon’s beast and insect properties were still at high class Dominator rank. If they &nbsp;also were to advance into the peak Dominator rank, then the Little Hidden Dragon with three main properties could probably challenge the near Immortal rank creatures!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I...... I surrender,” shouted He Zhen painfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon did not understand what He Zhen was saying. As it had not had its fill of souls yet, it flew towards He Zhen’s other peak Dominator rank soul pet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen saw the dire situation he was in and hurriedly chanted the incantation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen’s chanting speed was really fast, allowing his soul pet to escape death. Seeing that the Hidden Dragon &nbsp;could devour souls, He Zhen was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zazaza!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon saw that its food had disappeared and started grumbling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the Little Hidden Dragon turned towards He Zhen. He Zhen had also recalled his other soul pets. He Zhen’s soul remembrance was rather high. If it could devour his soul, then that should also allow it to grow by another ten percent. The Little Hidden Dragon flew towards He Zhen without the slightest sign of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen collapsed onto the ground in fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t this the Outstanding Expert Competition? Why is he even killing the soul pet trainers? This is clearly breaking the rules!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen did not dare to stay on the battlefield any longer and ran away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi exited the battlefield absentmindedly, while He Zhen had escaped in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the two most powerful individuals amongst them had lost, so the remaining young participants with weaker strength would not dare to stay on the battlefield any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The originally boisterous subjugation battle had ended up in such an utter failure. The spectators present on the various Hovering Mountain spectator seats could only feel astonished. Especially when they saw that the savage battle beast Mo Ye kept growing stronger on the battlefield and had crushed its enemies brutally, the impact of it was too intensive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody had imagined that the King from the New Moon Land could be this powerful. His decisive slaughtering also taught the others what being truly merciless meant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The organizer’s trap instead ended up becoming the target’s glory!</span></p>
