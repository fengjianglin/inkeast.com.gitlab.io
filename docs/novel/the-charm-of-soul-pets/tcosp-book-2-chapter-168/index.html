 <p><strong>Chapter 167: Eighth Phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect (2)</strong></p>
 <p><span>“Wenghuo!!!!! Wenghuo!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, even more disturbing insect cries began to transmit out from the center of the inner clubhouse!!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Pai!! Pai!!!! Pai!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The windows of the impressive club center were suddenly smashed. A group of Heavenly Devil Insect with six pairs of flesh wings made its way out of these pitch black shattered windows. They unexpectedly formed a Heavenly Devil Insect formation that resembled a large chessboard as they quickly flew in an onslaught towards everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the very front of this Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect formation were five physically larger Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects. It was the leaders of this nest - eighth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Everyone split up. This is a Heavenly Devil Insect Formation. Its destructive capabilities are very powerful!” loudly roared Meng Huazhong with his soul remembrance. He decisively jumped onto his Dark Clan Rhinoceros before yelling, “After splitting up, I’ll try my best to tie up one of the eighth phase high staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects. When you guys deal with those Devil Insect foot soldiers, try and get rid of those four other eighth phase early stage Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects as fast as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The four others nodded their heads. They called back their soul pets and immediately began riding on one of them as they all split up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhang Qian and Feng Qi fled to the left side while Ye Qingzi and Chu Mu went right. Practically as the five people and five soul pets left this area to different sides, the flying Devil Insect Formation’s force completely blew up the location they were just at…. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Hong hong hong hong!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The chessboard arrangement of the Devil Insect formation descended upon the club. Suddenly, the buildings of the club began to violent shake. Then, with a loud bang, they collapsed. The enormous sound instantly spread through the entire district. A moment later, a ball of incomparably turbid black gas rushed up into the sky from the ruins of the club!</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Mu turned around, and glanced at the collapsed buildings. He also had lingering fears in his heart, not expecting this Devil Insect Formation to be so formidable.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Chu Mu, there are a few seventh phase high saged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects following us.” Ye Qingzi, who was following Chu Mu, immediately warned him.</span></p>
 <p><span>If the seventh phase high staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects had been strengthened, their fighting strength would be extremely powerful. Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi would have no choice but to carefully deal with them. After all, they were four seventh phase high staged commanders!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Those two eighth phase early staged Heavenly Devil Insects also have their attentions fixated on us. Follow beside me, and support me as I get rid of them.” Chu Mu who had summoned the Night Thunder Dream Beast spoke to Ye Qingzi riding on her Purple Robe Dream Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ok.” nodded Ye Qingzi as she had her Purple Robe Dream Beast follow the Night Thunder Dream Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ye Qingzi had already recalled the slow moving Ice Fire Demon Fairy that had difficulties dodging. She had the Water Moon semi-hover in the air as she stood on the Purple Robe Dream Beast’s head to support Chu Mu’s fight.</span></p>
 <p><span>“There are twenty Heavenly Devil Insects on our left. You have to send one of your soul pets to get rid of them.” Ye Qingzi knit her eyebrows as she watched the group of Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects flying on the left.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Mu had previously already recalled the slow moving Devil Tree Battle Soldier. After sweeping his eyes over the twenty Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects on the right, he decisively had Zhan Ye come out and fight.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Violent Blood Pupil!” chanting an incantation, Chu Mu’s two eyes gradually transformed into a completely different blood color!</span></p>
 <p><span>Violent Blood Pupil was a spirit teacher technique. Using it on Mo Xie who was comparable to monarch would only increase her sixth phase eighth stage to the peak of the sixth phase.</span></p>
 <p><span>As Mo Xie’s phase and stage, and rank increased, Violent Blood Pupil was no longer able to directly raise her stage by five like it originally could. One reason was because after the seventh phase, the phase and stage gradient became larger. The other reason was because Mo Xie currently had the aura of a monarch, and her mind had become extremely strong. The mental stimulation would thus have a certain ineffectiveness. </span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Zhan Ye was right now only at the commander rank, and Violent Blood Pupil’s effects could fully manifest on its fifth phase seventh stage body.</span></p>
 <p><span>The blood colored armor and water sunset armor seemed to simultaneously sublimate Zhan Ye’s body. His phase and stage instantly increased to the sixth phase third stage, and his strength, speed and dark aura were somewhat strengthened.</span></p>
 <p><span>The techniques of Ye Qingzi’s Water Moon were extremely powerful. Zhan Ye’s ink armor defense, after obtaining the water armor’s support, unexpectedly immediately increased to the early seventh stage.</span></p>
 <p><span>Its defense had reached the seventh stage, and its strength had increased to sixth phase third stage. As long as it didn’t meet an eighth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect, Chu Mu liked to throw Zhan Ye anywhere. Even if it was being beleaguered by a dozen Heavenly Devil Insects, Chu Mu didn’t need to be worried. With six time Broken Limb Rebirth and with the addition of its tenacious life force and self healing abilities, it wouldn’t be possible to kill Zhan Ye for a little while.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You want it to deal with those twenty Heavenly Devil Insects?” Ye Qingzi glanced at Chu Mu’s Zhan Ye, which seemed to have not undergone strengthening.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ye Qingzi merely knew that Chu Mu’s Warbeast Mo ye was a soul pet with powerful life force and self healing abilities. However, even after being increased to the sixth phase third stage and its defense to the seventh stage, it was a bit too much to deal with twenty average ranked Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects in between the sixth and seventh phase.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t worry, you only have to ensure that it isn’t poisoned and it will be fine.”said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ye Qingzi shot Chu Mu a strange look, ostensibly feeling that Chu Mu was a bit merciless. Promptly, she ordered the Water Moon to attach a Water Spirit Nectar to Zhan Ye, in order to increase its life force.</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhan Ye’s life force was already six times a normal soul pet’s. This addition instantly increased it to seven times, and his rebirth ability also became seven times. Those twenty Heavenly Devil Insects would definitely fall apart.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hou!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhan Ye was a soul pet without fear or thoughts of death. Facing twenty, sixth phase and seventh phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects, its fighting intent still wildly surged forth. It completely disregarded nineteen of the Heavenly Devil Insects and locked onto the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect at the very front, before using its body to withstand all of the attacks. Then, it instantly used its Ink Armor Spike to kill the first Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nineteen Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect attacks instantly produced many wounds on Zhan Ye’s body. Nevertheless, the wounds were quickly healed. Zhan Ye continuously maintained the most vigorous fighting strength as it entangled itself with those nineteen Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span>“White Nightmare, come out!”</span></p>
 <p><span>With Ye Qingzi protecting him, Chu Mu recalled the Night Thunder Dream Beast and summoned the White Nightmare!</span></p>
 <p><span>Chanting an incantation, a white colored devil flame silently burned on Chu Mu’s body, slowly wrapping his body.</span></p>
 <p><span>The White Nightmare was like Chu Mu’s flaming specter. Even the flaming silhouette of its face resembled Chu Mu. An evil aura coldly exited Chu Mu’s body before his two evil pupils instantly fixed onto one of the eighth phase early staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span>“White Nightmare, take on those two eighth phase early staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects first.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span>The White Nightmare had already reached the seventh phase first stage. Its fighting strength was definitely fairly above eighth phase early stage commanders. However, simultaneously dealing with two eighth phase early staged strengthened commanders was evidently a bit strenuous. It definitely required support.</span></p>
 <p><span>Focusing on this monarch White Nightmare of Chu Mu, Ye Qingzi summoned a dark and fire dual with attributes unknown soul pet. It would support the monarch White Nightmare as it fought against two eighth phase early staged strengthened Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mo Xie, get rid of those four seventh phase high staged strengthened Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.” Chu Mu glanced at Ye Qingzi’s unknown soul pet, and he was promptly curious. However, for the time being, he didn’t ask about it, and had Mo Xie go deal with those four pursuing seventh phase high staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span>Without effects from the moonlight, the sixth phase eighth stage Mo Xie’s fighting strength was slightly lower that the White Nightmare. However, it wasn’t too big of an issue to deal with those four seventh phase high staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span>“Dream!”</span></p>
 <p><span>A few Heavenly Devil Insects suddenly fell from the sky, attempting to attack Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi. Ye Qingzi’s soul remembrance wasn’t lacking either, and she quickly detected them. She instantly had the Purple Robe Dream beast use the Dream technique.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the six approximately seventh phase Two Winged Heavenly Devil Insects flew within ten meters of the Purple Robe Dream Beast, their flesh wings gradually stopped beating. Finally, they completely lost their objective and fell into a sleep, crashing down from the sky!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Six Thunder Whistle!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lightning flashed on the dream horns. Once the Purple Robe Dream Beast let out a long cry, six purple colored lightning bolts flew out of the dream horns and accurately bombarded the six Heavenly Devil Insects that had entered the dream. Not even their remains were left after the six Heavenly Devil Insects were attacked!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Jie Jie~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span>The White Nightmare stood twenty meters in front of Chu Mu, and it stared at the large black insect cloud in the sky of two eighth phase early staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects. It completely had an arrogant and disdainful bearing!</span></p>
 <p><span>Ye Qingzi’s unknown dark fire dual attribute soul pet had already added on two forms of fire and darkness onto the White Nightmare, so its white demonic devil flames were even closer to the level of the white demonic devil flames that the half devil Chu Mu controlled. Evidently, it possessed a burning effect that was increased by fifty percent!</span></p>
 <p><span>The addition of the dark type was even more thorough. The dark aura on the White Nightmare became incomparably dense, and the monarch atmosphere unexpectedly caused the two eighth phase early staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects to let out a rather frightened expression.</span></p>
 <p><span>“White Nightmare, Earthen Fiend Devil Flames!” Chu Mu issued an order to the White Nightmare.</span></p>
 <p><span>The White Nightmare cracked open the corners of its sinister mouth, and it slowly extended an arm covered in flames. The dark energy and fire energy simultaneously gathered on the palm!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hong!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The palm abruptly smashed towards the ground. Suddenly, a loud fiery sound rang out and white demonic devil flames that were like an enormous ocean spray splashed out into the air from under the White Nightmare’s feet. The torrential flames instantaneously burned all the way to the horizon, and it torridly shot towards the two eighth phase early staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span>The white demonic devil flames were eminently magnificent. When they burst forth in the entire courtyard, a bone chilling soul flame aura swept up the surroundings!!</span></p>
 <p><span>“What happened. Why did a White Nightmare appear!?” Meng Huazhong riding on the Dark Clan Rhinoceros was in the process of attracting the eighth phase high staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s attention, when suddenly he felt a powerful monarch flame sweep towards him. His face promptly let out a shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Monarch ranked White Nightmare! That… that seems to be the White Nightmare that Chu Mu summoned.” from Zhang Qian’s position, he just happened to be able to see the White Nightmare fighting the two eighth phase early staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects alone. His expression was extremely stupefied!</span></p>
