 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the light that was shining ahead of him got covered by a huge palm. The original brightness had instantly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s trying to seal me inside!” Chu Mu saw that Extreme Sky Ice Beast had actually used its own hand to block the wound and cursed it inside his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It did not really want Chu Mu to enter inside itself at first, but now it did not want Chu Mu to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The coldness inside was getting more and more intense as time passed. The ice toxin was also infiltrating into Chu Mu’s soul. The Devil Fire within Chu Mu’s body was also rapidly diminishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If his soul was frozen, then it would really be very fatal for him. Chu Mu tried to use his spatial technique to directly tear open Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the defensive ability within Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body was similarly rock solid. Chu Mu could only leave scratch marks on the surface and could not really crush it no matter what he tried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast was also enduring the intense pain from getting wounded from the inside while it constantly poured the cold air into its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as it could freeze this damned human inside, that little thing would only end up like a parasite in its body. It would definitely not be affected by something this insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, according to its body proportion, Chu Mu realized that he was even smaller than those Ice Worms in Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s stomach. Furthermore, those parasites that were inside Extreme Sky Ice Beast did not seem to be weak at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Chu Mu could clearly not be bothered with that right now. He had to quickly think of a way to leave this Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice toxin had already infiltrated halfway into Chu Mu’s soul. Chu Mu took a glance at the spot where he hit. It seemed that he required much more power than that to break through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Chu Mu was feeling troubled, a pair of dragon horns suddenly drilled violently right through that crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon horns cleanly pierced through Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s skin and left a big hole on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was surprised when he saw that and hurriedly escaped from that hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast howled in pain. Its humongous body violently trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Chu Mu flew out of Extreme Sky Ice Beast, he turned around and immediately threw a dark spatial ball towards it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark spatial ball flew straight into Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body and exploded violently after wedging into its bone network. The explosion generated a terrifying destructive shockwave within its body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s bones kept getting shattered. It looked as if an ice cave had collapsed and everything was becoming a mess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body violently shook. A muffled shout came from its mouth. Even the air that it breathed out carried a darkness energy within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It swung its arms in mad fury and attacked randomly in all directions. The glacier became a mess and countless sharp ice spikes fell from all over the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Martial Cloud Dragon immediately took some distance from Extreme Sky Ice Beast. Extreme Sky Ice Beast was currently rampaging, they did not need to confront it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking some distance from it, Chu Mu suddenly felt a burning light shining on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heated sensation calmly seeped into his body from his back, and it slowly entered his soul. The coldness in his body and his soul had gradually dissipated, causing Chu Mu to feel a comfortable warmth soon after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu turned around and looked through the snowing sky. He saw Ye Qingzi smiling towards him from far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above Ye Qingzi, a creature that looked just like a sun hung quietly in the sky. The heat that melted the coldness in him also came from that creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that it was Ardent Yang Pupil, Ye Qingzi’s strongest support soul pet right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ardent Yang Pupil had not only dissipated the coldness in Chu Mu’s body, it had also left behind a hidden flame burning in his body. This temperature generated a sustained shield effect and also warded off the surrounding coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s strength had fallen by a margin due to the environmental suppression. The shine from this Ardent Yang Pupil had managed to negate this suppression. Chu Mu had finally managed to regain his normal strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a while since Chu Mu had paid attention to Ye Qingzi’s cultivation level. He had never expected her Ardent Yang Pupil to attain this level of strength. If it was a battle in a different situation, then the Flaming Shine could even boost Chu Mu’s strength by a good margin. The effect of this support type was very obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast had suffered from heavy damage this time, Chu Mu and Martial Cloud Dragon quickly performed another joint attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They still used the same tactic of corroding the armor using darkness property, then unleashing heavy attacks right after. After a few clashes, Extreme Sky Ice Beast was riddled with wounds and holes. Especially on its abdomen region, they could easily see the shattered bone structures within the gaping holes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast had also learned from their attack pattern. It no longer attacked straightforwardly. It kept using its shell armor on its back to defend against Martial Cloud Dragon and Chu Mu’s techniques!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had to admit that the shell armor on Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s back was several times thicker than the armor around its chest and abdomen. No matter how Chu Mu used the darkness corrosion, he was unable to weaken the thick armor on its back. Any attack that landed on this shell armor could hardly deal any damage at all to Extreme Sky Ice Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the Extreme Sky Ice Beast saw Martial Cloud Dragon and Chu Mu executing a highly destructive technique, it would immediately lie on the ground and would use the shell armor on its back to protect its body. All attacks became ineffective against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it rock type or ice type!?” Chu Mu felt a little helpless against the armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice type creatures certainly were proficient in defense. However, a defense like this Extreme Sky Ice Beast where its ice shell would clearly not break no matter how they attacked was really a headache to them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Giant races are all like that, especially a high bloodline giant race. Other than not being as agile as the beast type creatures, they have gained many properties of the beast race, as well as the defensive strength slightly inferior to the rock type. This fellow would be a classic example of the strongest giant race,” explained Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s Ghost King was a giant race of the rock type. Its defensive strength was so solid that it might not get hurt even from the attacks from million iceberg monsters. However, that was in the end still inferior to the defensive strength of this Extreme Sky Ice Beast. If Ghost King could reach Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s level of defense, then it would clearly become unparalleled in the entire Zhengming Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Extreme Sky Ice Beast was the most troublesome opponent that Chu Mu had encountered. Remembering that this was only a subordinate of the Ancient Flood Dragon Person, a foreboding danger loomed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Extreme Sky Ice Beast was already this powerful, then just how powerful would the Ancient Flood Dragon Person be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi, can your Ardent Yang Pupil melt these ice?” asked Chu Mu quickly with his mental voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, the ice there is too thick. The ice crystal rank is also rather high, my Ardent Yang Pupil can only melt a portion of the ice body,” replied Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then melt as much as possible,” said Chu Mu resolutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi nodded and took a glance at her Ardent Yang Pupil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ardent Yang Pupil hung high in the sky and started to spread its fervent light all around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the light, there seemed to be some roots stretching out from the center of Ardent Yang Pupil and drilling into the frozen land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ardent Yang Pupil was a plant type creature. Plant type creatures had poor fighting strength overall, but they were masters at domain creation. When the Burning Ray and the Burning Roots spread across the glacier, white water vapor could be clearly seen rising from the thick ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice slowly had melted. The dazzling light had not only added a layer of heat in this glacier region, but it had also made all the iceberg monsters in the surrounding feel an uncomfortable shine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ardent Yang Pupil’s spreading speed was not too fast. Those iceberg monsters which held supremacy in the extreme cold did not care about such heat in the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as the battle continued, the ice had melted unknowingly unknowingly and the temperature had also gradually risen. It had slowly started affecting the strength of those iceberg monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the glacier, the iceberg monsters were clearly strengthened in proportion to the coldness in the air. However, as the temperature continued rising, their strength was severely weakened. This weakening applied to the entire group. Even Extreme Sky Ice Beast was weakened without the advantage of the environment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The further Ye Qingzi’s Ardent Yang Pupil's domain spread, the better it could take control of the environment. The glacier had gradually started melting, the rivers and the lakes could be seen appearing everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Sky Ice Beast detested heat the most. When its perfect glacier world was melted into water right before its eyes, it became extremely furious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extreme Ice Beast opened its mouth and immediately spat out a chilling wind that quickly swept across the entire glacier world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any place that was swept up by the chilling wind had rapidly frozen once again. The falling snow suppressed the light of Ardent Yang Pupil......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ardent Yang Pupil could not compete against the power of Extreme Sky Ice Beast after all. A breath from Extreme Sky Ice Beast had easily lowered the temperature again and made the environment even colder than it was before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Martial Cloud Dragon were impatiently waiting for this breath attack from Extreme Sky Ice Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu began chanting first and a darkness gate appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The darkness gate opened and clusters of dark feathered clouds swarmed out from within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The apocalyptical crows flapped their wings ominously and charged out from the darkness gate, flying straight towards Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those dark crows did not possess any real offensive property. Their targets were instead the wounds on Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body. Once a dark crow squeezes into a wound, any graze or simple scratch would be magnified infinitely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crows that were manifested from the darkness energy had formed into crowds. They were as tiny as mosquitoes in Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s eyes. However, they were able to freely infest its wounds and they kept corroding its ice-colored skin into complete black. Its wounds were also rapidly tearing open. It appeared as if this crowd of hungry crows were clearly feasting on Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s skin and flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Martial Cloud Dragon cooperated rather well with Chu Mu. When Chu Mu unleashed the darkness gate, Martial Cloud Dragon also gathered its power on its dark blue membrane wings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the darkness corrosion reached a suitable state, Martial Cloud Dragon glowed blue and its entire body turned into a blue winged blade, slashing quickly towards Extreme Sky Ice Beast with extreme speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This slash decisively cut open Extreme Sky Cloud Beast’s abdomen and severed its solid pelvic bones all the way until its ice shell armor on its back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This slash bent Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s body, and the humongous mountain-like body slowly slid down and collapsed!</span></p>
