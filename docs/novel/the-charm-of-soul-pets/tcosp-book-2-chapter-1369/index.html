 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An utterly bloody scene. Many Hovering Mountains had been thoroughly dyed in blood, giving off a heavy visual impact to the people present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stood quietly on the battlefield. Zhan Ye who was still not satisfied, Little Hidden Dragon and Dead Dream had returned to his side and were waiting for the following battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Needless to say, nobody else dared to step up to the challenge. Only Chu Mu and his soul pets remained on the Hovering Mountain Battlefield, as well as countless patches of blood stains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you officially begin the finals now?” Chu Mu raised his gaze and focused on Tang Ang as he said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Angs' face was expressionless, it was not known how he was feeling right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You just amount to this much. What right do you have to be so arrogant? You’re only cruel in your methods, thats all!” said Han Erxing in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo and Xin Xin did not say anything, their attention was gathered on Chu Mu’s Zhan Ye. If that battle beast Mo Ye could still use the Broken Limb Rebirth, then its strength might advance into the Immortal rank. It would pose an extremely big threat to them if it could really reach the Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo knew that he would have to face off against Chu Mu in the upcoming finals. The result of the trap he set was dissatisfying for Tang Zhuo, but he had at least grasped the opponent’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When taking on that battle beast Mo Ye, we must kill it immediately, or it will spell great trouble later on,” whispered Xin Xin to Tang Zhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo nodded, “Hmm, once this soul pet of his is suppressed, then he won’t be a threat to us anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The greatest dependence of Tang Zhuo and his gang was the Immortal rank. The battles till now had not involved such a domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guo Shi, it’s your turn. Finish off that soul pet of his,” Han Erxing appeared to be a little annoyed as he ordered Guo Shi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi was startled for a moment as he heard him and he suddenly realized that the cruel man before him would be his first opponent in the upcoming finals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he going to keep fighting?” said Guo Shi a little absentmindedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not return to the spectator seats. His gaze was focused on the main referee, indicating that he could still continue on with the match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody was opposed to Chu Mu &nbsp;replacing Gao He as a participant in the finals any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s action of requesting the match to continue had caused yet another commotion to ensue amongst the spectator seats. There actually existed such a battle maniac in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main referee then announced the match between Chu Mu and Guo Shi, bringing the battle back to the official finals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, anyone could see that Guo Shi was losing his cool and the pride that he had shown before was nowhere after stepping into the battlefield again. Instead, he seemed to be cowering in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below the battlefield, Huang Yufei was laughing out loud after seeing Guo Shi’s behavior, “Haha, serve you right! Guo Shi, this is your end. Chu Mu, you must treat him very well, who asked him to humiliate us that day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingqing who was sitting beside him was also very excited. Chu Mu’s savage performance just now was really too dazzling. Normally, Li Qingqing would prefer those elegant young masters like Xin Xin. However, seeing Chu Mu standing proudly above everyone and mercilessly killing those young participants’ soul pets, she immediately felt a sense of admiration towards Chu Mu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know him?” asked a young participant who was next to Huang Yufei in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei immediately puffed out his chest and proudly said, “Of course, we are brothers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guo Shi is certainly an irritating guy. Seeing him like this has made me feel quite satisfied. Speaking of which, I had always thought that the New Moon Land was just a small place. But after hearing the discussions that are happening in the surroundings, I have finally realized that the New Moon Land is not any inferior to some of the Borders now. And with such a King standing tall, New Moon Land is probably a place with a strong backbone,” said that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young generations were easy to provoke, just like how those few words of favoritism from Tang Ang were enough to induce public outrage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, once the situation was changed, then their mindsets would also change along with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, Madam Gao and Yu Suo had already spread the truth of the matter among the crowd at the right timing, and the spectators found out that all of it was just a trap for Chu Mu set up by Tang Ang, Tang Zhuo and the other high ranking people. After knwing this, their attitude towards the New Moon Land and that merciless King took another turn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the spectators were looking at Guo Shi with a gloating attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi was particularly famous for his poor personality. Not only Huang Yufei, but most of the people present at the venue who were not as high in position as Guo Shi were on the receiving end of his sneering and mockery. Now that Guo Shi would be the one taking the stage, many people were eager to see how he would be humiliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi was only slightly stronger than Han Qi and He Zhen. Even with the two of them teaming up along with the other high class or peak Dominators, they had suffered a crushing defeat. What could he alone possibly use to fight against Chu Mu? Perhaps that battle beast Mo Ye alone was enough to finish off all of his soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi had taken a spectating role at first, but now he ended up being the one who was spectated. After dragging on for a long time, he finally stood on the Hovering Mountain Battlefield again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a look at the blood filled Hovering Mountain Battlefield and the corpses of those peak Dominator soul pets strewn all around, Guo Shi’s expression turned even poorer than before. He kept turning back to take a look at Tang Zhuo and Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You may begin,” announced the main referee plainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi was startled. He was not prepared to fight at all and called out to the main referee in a panic, “Wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want?” asked the main referee impatiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The official competition does not allow killing, right?” asked Guo Shi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Guo Shi had asked that question, the participants at the venue immediately started laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most soul pet trainers had experienced various kinds of hardship during the course of their training. Especially those without any backgrounds, they had climbed up to the Dominator position through countless slaughters. Hence, this amount of blood spilling did not have too much of an effect on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as one of the Outstanding Expert Competition's finalists in the Zhengming Main City, not only was Guo Shi shivering before those soul pet corpses, he had even dared to ask such a question. It was really laughable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi’s face had turned bright red after hearing the mocking laughter directed at him and he rebutted loudly, “I just wanted to know the competition rules, so that I don’t break the rules when fighting against him later!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing and Tang Zhuo's mouths started twitching when they heard him. Guo Shi was famous for bullying the weak and fearing the strong. However, getting mocked by so many people was really too shameful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi’s senior, Yin Ce, from the Demon Beast Palace shook his head in disappointment as he sighed. If he knew that Guo Shi was such a coward, then he would not have let Guo Shi participate in this Outstanding Expert Competition. Guo Shi was bringing shame to the name of the Demon Beast Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Competition rules state that killing another participant is forbidden. However, the death of soul pets does not count as a violation, but intentional murder is forbidden,” replied the main referee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi’s expression became even uglier after hearing the rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Intentional murder was forbidden, that rules was as good as non-existent. Life and death in a battle at such a high level was instantaneous. The opponent could easily kill his soul pet according to such a rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling the ghastly look on Han Qi and He Zhen's face from a while ago, the muscles on Guo Shi’s face kept twitching violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After further hesitation, Guo Shi finally made a decision. He spoke with a serious expression, “I have sparred against Han Qi before. I’m only slightly stronger than him. Since even he is not a match for Chu Mu, then there’s no meaning in me fighting. So, I surrender.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you certain that you wish to forfeit?” asked the main referee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi nodded, “I forfeit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright then, get lost,” replied the main referee nonchalantly after nodding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi’s expression paled from anger and shame. He had never imagined that he would be humiliated like this by the main referee!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The words spoken by the main referee had induced yet another round of laughter. Everyone looked at the cowardly Guo Shi in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi had never received such kind of attention before. Those mocking gazes and the humiliating words made Guo Shi feel as if countless poisonous ants were crawling all over his body, completely unbearable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yin Ce, your Demon Beast Palace’s disciple knows his limits. Forfeiting in such a big competition requires quite the amount of courage, don’t you think?” said the Elemental Clan’s Peng Meng as he smiled while looking over at the Demon Beast Palace’s leader, Yin Ce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Ce shook his head and sighed. He had originally thought that Guo Shi was a good seedling to be nurtured. He was going to try to get Guo Shi into one beast type sect as a disciple, but to think that Guo Shi turned out to be such a coward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing one’s limit was in fact a good thing. Sometimes, there was no need to make unnecessary sacrifices. However, Guo Shi was participating in the Outstanding Expert Competition as a representative of the Demon Beast Palace. The Demon Beast Palace stood behind him. When he had forfeited, he had never even considered the reputation of the Demon Beast Palace. How could Yin Ce consider &nbsp;nurturing such a disciple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi &nbsp;still did not know that because of his act of cowardice, he would no longer be receiving the support of the Demon Beast Palace. Someone like him who had only reached his current level due to the favorable treatment from the Demon Beast Palace would only amount to this much in his life in the end. Worse still, if his soul pet died, then his strength would also greatly diminish. After all, he could not find any method to strengthen his soul pet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing and Tang Zhou also had poor expressions on their faces. That Guo Shi was really too humiliating. His action had only made Chu Mu shine even brighter than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment, they had already kicked Guo Shi out of their circle in their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Making the outstanding expert from the Demon Beast Palace forfeit, this was sufficient enough to represent Chu Mu’s strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the battlefield, as Chu Mu watched Guo Shi leaving, he was feeling quite down in his heart instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Guo Shi had fought on, then Zhan Ye would get a chance to use the sixth Broken Limb Rebirth. He would also be able to witness the full strength of Zhan Ye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking back at the situation, that Guo Shi was also rather smart. If he did not escape, then it would be hard to say if Chu Mu would slaughter all of his soul pets or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the battle had come to an end, Chu Mu recalled his soul pets and left the Hovering Mountain Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Hovering Mountain Battlefield still remained bloody, while many corpses were strewn all over the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody cleaned up the venue and the next match was to be held as is. No matter how spectacular the battle between the next two participants was going to be, it would still be outshined by the blood red Hovering Mountain. The spectators would each time recall the astonishing battle scene of that one vs many.</span></p>
