 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hei, Brother Chu, tonight in Guang Moon Palace, the Saintess will give all the experts an Eternal Blessing. Let’s go see it, shall we?” After leaving the building, Huang Yufei immediately extended a friendly invite to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they were all the same age, they clearly would have more topics of discussion together. Huang Yufei didn’t want to be behind his father all day, and act politely towards everyone that they met. That would be too restricting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, there are also many different experts in Zhengming Continent that will be there. We might be able to see the experts that entered the last battle. If we can make friends with them, it would be an extremely lucky thing.” Li Qingqing started convincing Chu Mu as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s the Saintess?” Chu Mu was like a person that just came out from living under a rock; he knew nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, are you really part of Zhengming Continent? Why does it feel like you’re from Wupan Continent?” Li QIngqing said speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m usually training in the wild, so I don’t know much about current events.” Chu Mu explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That isn’t strange. The Saintess became supported by many people in recent years. I remember it was last year or the year before when a terrifying epidemic broke out that killed exponential amounts of people every day. Just when we thought this epidemic would kill the entire city, an angel-like woman appeared. She planted many flowers within Ke City. Her flowers’ aroma dispersed all the plague soul pets and saved the entire city. From then on, everyone called her a Saintess.” Huang Yufei said excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Also, I heard a lot of people say that wherever she plants flowers, one’s body gets nurtured. Normal people could increase their lifespan, while soul pet trainers could slowly increase their remembrance. Soul pets also reach their healthiest state….. She also has the ability to give Eternal Blessings- it’s all very magical.” Li Qingqing quickly added, showing her reverence for this Saintess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She wears a veil?” Chu Mu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you know? Though she wears a veil, everyone knows she is definitely the prettiest woman on earth. At the time, I was just one follower in a sea of people, but when she glanced over, I felt as if I were shocked with electricity. I am sure that she saw me in the crowd…..” Huang Yufei said with radiant delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside, Li Qingqing rolled her eyes and said, “Huang Yufei, are you really this shameless? Do you have to say it every time you see anyone? I’m tired of this story already!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei said seriously, “I’m just speaking the truth, she saw me, you have no idea how many people were there too…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingqing didn’t mind Huang Yufei’s narcissism and hugged Chu Mu’s arm with a smile, “Let’s go, let’s go, maybe we can get the Eternal Blessing too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu wasn’t used to a stranger being so close with him, but he felt that it was impolite to reject them. After all, their Border Lord Dlders indeed helped New Moon Land out greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let’s go and see.” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, Chu Mu was basically sure of who this ‘Saintess’ was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guang Moon Palace sat near Divine Sect sacred mountain. This palace was completely made with white jade. There was a vibrant crescent-shaped white jade floating on the domed roof. When Zhengming City fell into night time, the palace’s stones combined with the moonlight to make it seem truly like a Moon Palace, unique and beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tonight, Guang Moon Palace was filled with countless young soul pet trainers. From the far streets up to Guang Moon Palace’s luxurious doors, countless heads bobbed up and down with no space in between.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eternal Blessing, what an exciting event! If they could receive this Eternal Blessing, it was like giving their soul pet a new ability!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul pets’ rank could be increased through diligent training and Xuan items. However, a soul pets’ abilities were similar to species techniques in that they couldn’t be obtained through normal outside means. Like Binding Wind Spirit’s Ancient Will, these abilities couldn’t be received from Xuan Items. A Binding Wind Spirit with Ancient Will would be much stronger than most other wind type soul pets in similar rank battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than this, Zhan Ye’s Ancient Beast Soul, Mo Xie’s Moon Essence, Night’s Blood Marks, Thousand Wave Beast’s Void Armor,and &nbsp;Zhan Ye’s special life force, these were all species techniques that had nothing to do with rank but could still boost one’s effective fighting power greatly. The classic example was Zhan Ye. It could challenge opponents two ranks above it because it had a few very perfect techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, gaining permanent ability through the blessing was far more valuable than a Xuan item or even Immortal item. It was hard to estimate. It was possible that an average person could suddenly become a powerful person because they received a very suitable technique. This often happened in the ever-shifting landscape of soul pet trainers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was truly a sea of people. Looking at the jam-packed crowd and watching everyone act so reverently towards the Saintess, Chu Mu felt it was strange. Just how could that woman cause a group of normally logical young soul pet trainers to become this fervent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he hadn’t seen it himself, Chu Mu could hardly believe how so many arrogant experts could put down their guises and await the Saintess like a group of lowly servants. This definitely wasn’t just a matter of a permanent blessing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How are there so many people now!” Li Qingqing looked at the long line and said angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many people are probably here because of the crown. With the Saintess getting more and more famous, many people wanted to see her out of curiosity. It isn’t strange that there are this many.” Huang Yufei said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heng, no wonder, there are mostly guys!” Li Qingqing humphed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu gazed forth and noticed that the men indeed far outnumbered the women. Like what Huang Yufei said, even if they didn’t have a chance to get the Eternal Blessing, they probably came to see her appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like in Xiangrong City, having heard many things about the Emperor Concubine, Chu Mu was also curious as to what kind of woman could receive this many peoples’ support and wanted to see her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like back in Wanxiang City, Yu Suo had created the perfect image for herself. Seeing so many fervent people here, one knew that if anyone demeaned her, the crowd would turn against that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, of course, wouldn’t be untactful and expose her. As long as she wasn’t harming people that he cared about, he was fine with whatever her plans were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, this time, didn’t really come for the excitement. The experts in the Outstanding Experts Competition should all be in the Guang Moon Palace now. The person Yu Bo had told him to fight was in there. Chu Mu came to get an understanding of this person less he go into the fight unprepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, Chu Mu wanted to ask Yu Suo something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passing through the crowd and walking to Guang Moon Palace’s stairs, Li QIngqing and Huang Yufei both showed their identity to convince the guards to let them into the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking through the crowd, Chu Mu noticed that not everyone was an avid admirer here. A large group were also people who had been helped by the Saintess and wanted to come to give their heartfelt thanks. Especially the people from Ke City, her act of getting rid of the plague saved their lives and their families. This favor deserved such respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the large group of people kneeling in return for the favor they received, Chu Mu was actually still wondering whether the plague was also created by Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was, Yu Suo truly was cold-hearted. These people kneeling would then have been thoroughly played by her, yet they were still loyally thanking her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If she didn't create the plague, then she truly was doing good. After all, a normal plague could already take away millions of lives or more. In front of plagues, normal lives were truly fragile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering Guang Moon Palace, it was less squished. Chu Mu followed Huang Yufei and Li QIngqing into the back garden of Guang Moon Palace, only to find that many young soul pet trainers were sitting on vine seats, silently waiting for something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You three may sit.” The old manager put the three near the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t strange. Li Qingqing and Huang Yufei didn’t receive any good ranks in the Outstanding Experts Competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Weiwei, Huang Yufei, did you see the person in white upfront? He has to be Elemental Clan “Son of Wind” Xin Xin. Xin Xin even spoke to me and called me pretty…..” Li Qingqing grabbed Huang Yufei’s sleeve excitedly, as if she saw her dream man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei was disgusted. Just now he was berated for showing off, yet wasn’t she doing the same now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t know who Saintess is, you definitely don’t know who Son of Wind Xin Xin is, right?” Huang Yufei saw Chu Mu’s confusion and explained helplessly, “Xin Xin is one of the most powerful Elemental Clan young generation members. He was outstanding in this Outstanding Experts Competition. The reason he is called “Son of Wind” is because he’s gentle and elegant like the wind, but also he has a special understanding of wind type soul pets. Even some older generation members feel inferior to him. He’s a rare genius of Zhengming Continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded and said, “I only know Tang Zhuo is pretty powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo was the person Yu Bo said he would have to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Zhuo?” The person sitting in front of them suddenly turned around and glared at Chu Mu, “ You really don’t know how to speak, ey? What do you mean ‘pretty powerful’? We people in the back row probably can’t even defeat his weakest soul pet. Don’t say it as if you’re pretty close to his level. We’re just a dozen meters away from his seat, but these dozens of meters may be insurmountable in our lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei suddenly was embarrassed and said, “Brother Nie, my friend has trained for a long time and doesn’t really know about current events. He didn’t even know who the Saintess was, so let’s be kind please.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person was named Nie, and he lifted an eyebrow and didn’t continue, only saying lightly, “Tang Zhuo is likely the person to win this time. Of the hundred people here, who dares say they can even match him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying that, he continued with envy, “This Eternal Blessing is also likely his.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” This time, Chu Mu’s brow lifted.</span></p>
