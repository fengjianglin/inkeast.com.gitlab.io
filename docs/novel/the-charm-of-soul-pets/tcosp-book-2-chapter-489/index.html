It was like an enormous bell ringing right next to one’s ears. The killers all let out horrified expressions, and their soul pets swept their eyes around the area in fear. They wanted to know what creature it was that was releasing such a powerful aura!!</span></p>

It enveloped the entire mountain ridge. Faintly, it was possible to see that next to Chu Mu was an enormous but distinct beast soul pet!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beast soul pet was the liberation of an ancient Mo Ye strength. Its eyes were pitch-black, and were full of the most terrifying darkness energy. Its body was rather robust, and underneath its mysterious and unknown horned beast devil scars, it was full of strength. It seemed to only need to raise its leg, and a mountain would collapse while the earth would split!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhen Ye, annihilate them!” Chu Mu ordered!</span></p>

When Chu Mu gave the order to annihilate, a disaster-level storm immediately swept the area!!</span></p>

The figure of death that was a mix of the dark and beast aura enveloped the area Zhan Ye was in!!</span></p>

Immediately after, these soul pets spat out fresh blood!!</span></p>

These green clothes killers immediately turned pale afterwards...</span></p>

They could only feel a black wind sweeping through. The only thing it left in its wake were corpses that collapsed in a pool of blood, devoid of any trace of life!&nbsp;</span></p>

Its claws rapidly rained down and shocking claw marks appeared on the cragged mountain back. In a short period of time, it seemed that the entire mountain back was going to be cut down by Zhan Ye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was remarkably silent throughout the entire course of the slaughter. None of the soul pets or killers let out miserable cries before their deaths.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even after all of the killers had been slaughtered, it took them a good few seconds before they truly believed the scene before their eyes!!</span></p>

Its black pupils resembled a stare of death and they couldn’t help but tremble from head to toe!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pan Zheng’s two soul pets were both ninth phase middle class monarchs. A mere peak phase monarch was an entire four levels higher than a middle class monarch, and adding on the tenth phase and ninth phase difference, the only fate that awaited these ninth phase middle class monarchs was instant death!!&nbsp;</span></p>

Pan Zheng’s two soul pets didn’t even have the ability to defend, and were blown into pieces of flesh by the Destructive Ray explosions. Their bodies transformed into countless pieces that littered the foot of the mountain...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pan Zheng’s soul was already wounded, and the loss of these two souls at once caused his spirit to nearly shatter. His entire body was painfully keeled over on the ground. His pale face was almost ashen and beads of sweat rolled off his face as his body convulsed in pain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The abnormality was too sudden and Ling He, standing next to Pan Zheng, was dumbstruck. He simply couldn’t believe that Chu Mu’s Mo Ye had such terrifying strength. It was so terrifying that it surpassed the level that they were currently at. It was as terrifying as the Hundred Thousand Legged Centipede that had killed his tenth phase Ardent Sun Rhinoceros earlier!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling He trembled from head to toe. The large mass of corpses and striking blood told him that this was all real. Even if he was unable to understand where the strength of Chu Mu’s Mo Ye came from, instinct told him that he had to flee this place. Otherwise, his end would be the same as these killers!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling He rapidly summoned two soul pets, and as Pan Zheng’s two soul pets were killed. Ling He ordered them to take the initiative to attack Zhan Ye.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even if he was in shock and fear, he was able to adopt measures to protect himself in as short of time as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu also showed expressions of shock as he watched Ling He flee at a very opportune moment.&nbsp;</span></p>

His mind and survival awareness were clearly much stronger than Pan Zheng’s. If the situation was normal, it really would have been difficult for Chu Mu to prevent Ling He, who had left behind his two main pets, from fleeing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Zhan Ye had killed with Chu Mu for so many years, and obviously knew how to deal with enemies that attempted to flee.&nbsp;</span></p>

The second grade’s strongest Ling He was surprisingly unable to flee from his deadly fate. Such a miserable death had occurred under the hands of a brat that should have been insignificant!&nbsp;</span></p>

Originally, Chu Mu had planned on having Zhan Ye kill all of Ling He’s soul pet, and then force him to tell him secrets about the female master. Who knew that Zhan Ye’s killing strength was so terrifying that both the pet and human were instakilled. However, it could be regarded as Chu Mu witnessing once more the tyrannical strength of a tenth phase peak monarch!&nbsp;</span></p>

Such strength was truly invincible in the second grade. However, unfortunately, Ling He, this expert who had hidden his strength extremely deeply, had encountered Chu Mu, whose soul pets were all extremely abnormal!&nbsp;</span></p>

Your souls are injured from deaths, and you’re no longer a threat to me.” Chu Mu walked in front of Pan Zheng and coldly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>

Not long ago he was still madly laughing as if he finally had the chance to take revenge for his soul pet. But right now he was lying pitifully on the ground, begging Chu Mu to let him live.&nbsp;</span></p>

I really don’t know about anything else. That woman has kept everything a very tight secret. Everybody only knows that we can obtain benefits from her so we sacrifice ourselves to her. Even Ling He doesn’t know much. Chu Chen, Chu Chen, there’s really not much animosity between us. You don’t have to kill me. Let me live and I can promise you many benefits…” Pan Zheng trembled as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had thought that Pan Zheng would be able to supply some information. However, he never expected that Pan Zheng was merely a thug. He was unable to obtain anything he wanted from him.&nbsp;</span></p>

Go back and rest. You need to have a very deep sleep.”&nbsp;</span></p>
