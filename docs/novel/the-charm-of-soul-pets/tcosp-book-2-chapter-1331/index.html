 <p>The darkness aura was slowly fading and in its place, overbearing devil flames controlled this domain!!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As their visions slowly grew clear, the seven people quickly looked under the Messiah Tree. However, the sudden appearance of dark devil flames and silver devil flames that split the world in two made them stunned!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At some point, a haughty and supreme devil had appeared underneath the Messiah Tree!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This devil was standing next to the young woman who had the Messiah Tree seed. Its body was filled with rage, grievance, evil, and hate that was capable of sweeping through the world and making it tremble!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Corpses and blood filled the ground. Departed spirits were circling the withered and old godly tree. These all became a part of the supreme devil’s evil power and poured into its body!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What was most astonishing was its body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The space between its brows was the world. Its left side of the body was a supremely angry and violent black color. Ruthless and bloodthirsty black flames wantonly danced in the air, displaying its arrogance and contempt towards all living things!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Its right side was a supremely evil and yin silver color. Emotionless and cold silver devil flames silently burned. It didn’t have an overbearing supreme attitude. But any creature that attempted to provoke it would inevitably be burned to ashes and have its soul obliterated!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Dark and silver, black and white. The dark black berserk violence carried an extremely dangerous silver-white cold-bloodedness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two different devil flames were a manifestation of the two sides of evil in Chu Mu’s heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What… what… what is this?!!” the most cowardly of them, Huo Lei, cried out in fright.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The other six were stunned by the fiendish devil flames. They were immortal rank experts and had seen countless soul pets. But they had never seen such a shocking creature as the supreme devil in front of them!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The seven immortal rank experts hadn’t come alone. Their subordinates were currently hiding and watching from afar. Among them, 50 spirit dominator rank experts were standing in the black flames while another fifty spirit dominators were standing in the silver flames.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But it didn’t matter which flame they were standing in, fear had gripped all of their souls, preventing them from staring directly at the devil underneath the Messiah Tree!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nobody had seen this creature before. It was neither the highest bloodline Black Nightmare that possessed the most ruthless and evil strength in the world, nor was it a solitary and cold-blooded silver devil that disdainfully looked down on the world. It was an amalgamation of both powers, while also a duality of both!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The greedy and ruthless invaders had spared no means to obtain the Messiah Tree’s seed. But in front of the dual-sided devil, the powerful immortal ranks finally felt a sliver of fear. The young woman with the Messiah Tree seed was right in front of them, but none of them dared to take a step forward.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hu hu hu hu hu~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Two bright and contrasting devil flames were burning. Chu Mu’s black and silver pupils were staring at Kang Ruodong, who was closest to the Messiah Tree.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A black headcloth, protruding cheekbones, and a pair of eyes that was dirtied from greed and desire. He was the closest to the Messiah Tree, almost as if he was saying he had the strongest instinct. Indeed, he, more than anyone else, wanted to obtain the Messiah Tree Seed after chasing it for countless years! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu stared at him, and the black and silver devil flames on his body suddenly rose up, becoming incomparably violent!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was the person who had pursued Ning Maner many years ago. Even now, he hadn’t given up his plans of obtaining the Messiah Tree Seed from Ning Maner. In the Monument Tear’s scene, Chu Mu had wanted nothing more than to burn this man, whose laugh made others wretch, into ashes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was the person Ning Maner hated. Then he should be the first to die!</p>
 <p>“Hu!”</p>
 <p>Chu Mu stepped forward. It was only a slow step forward.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But space intersected as reality and the void came together. When Chu Mu stepped forward, he disappeared from his spot!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And when Chu Mu finished his step, his black and white devil flamed body had suddenly appeared behind the Poison Tooth Beast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong was sitting on the Poison Tooth Beast’s back. Just now he had felt the chaotic and evil devil staring at him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But when he earnestly went to look back at the black and white devil, the devil had already disappeared. And mysteriously, a cold feeling was lingering at the back on his neck.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your death is undeserving of pity.” Chu Mu’s devilish voice rang out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He extended his hand burning with black devil flames. It stretched out into the air both slowly and strangely.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Mu clenched his hand. As if he had found something, he pulled it backward, along with the blood vessels and flesh!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong’s face instantly went pale. He abruptly felt a severe pain in his heart. It hurt so much it became extremely difficult for him to breathe!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But how could a person without a heart breathe?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong struggled to turn around, and looked at the black and white devil as his body convulsed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Look at your heart. Aside from greed, what else is there?” Chu Mu stuck out his hand to give Kang Ruodong a clear look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The blood vessels were filled with chaotically flowing blood. Kang Ruodong’s eyes were filled with veins that looked like they were going to explode. His eyes were full of fear and disbelief!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong didn’t think he would die, nor did he think that he would see his own heart before he died!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hou hou hou hou!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The Poison Tooth Beast let out a series of roars. It wasn’t until Chu Mu had dropped Kang Ruodong’s heart on the ground like a piece of trash that it realized its own master had been killed by this devil!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The enraged and berserk Poison Tooth Beast used a Shattering Tooth Charge as countless piercing Tooth flew at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu’s silver pupil slowly moved. In the vision of his left eye, the Poison Tooth Beast grew abnormally slow. Chu Mu’s expression resembled a god, waiting for the Poison Tooth Beast to arrive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Mu raised his foot and stomped on the ground. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A wave of air violently surged up from the stomp, easily flipped over the Poison Tooth Beast charging at him with extreme speed. It was knocked back into the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Poison Tooth Beast had completely lost its balance in the air, and couldn’t stop tumbling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu raised his head and as his black pupil and silver pupil stared at the Poison Tooth Beast, and ardent flames dripping with killing intent erupted!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Beng!!!!!”</p>
 <p>In midair, the Poison Tooth Beast abruptly blew up into two pieces!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Half of the devil flames were black scorching evil that violently burned, while the other half were silver and cold devil flames that burned with deathly silence.</p>
 <p>“Hu hu~~~~”</p>
 <p>The immortal rank Poison Tooth Beast transformed into a gorgeous two-colored meteor that fell from the sky. By the time it landed on the ground, it had turned to ashes with nothing remaining.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An atmosphere of fear and terror filled the audience. Just as the six immortal rank experts under the Messiah Tree sucked in a breath of cold air, a cold feeling seeped through their bodies and into their bone marrows and souls.</p>
 <p>As for the dominator rank experts who didn’t dare participate in an immortal rank fight, they were as dumbstruck as wooden chickens.</p>
 <p>Even the immortal rank Poison Tooth Beast couldn’t withstand a single strike. How strong was this black and silver dual burning devil?!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nine Ghosts Shen, standing closest to the Messiah Tree, subconsciously took a few steps back and stood with the other five.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had clearly seen the process by which the devil had killed Kang Ruodong and the Poison Tooth Beast. If the devil had attacked him instead, how confident was he in surviving?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If you don’t want to end up like Kang Ruodong, everyone had better stick together. It’s just a mutated Nightmare. Once we kill it, the Messiah Tree seed will belong to us!!” Divine Sect’s Xu Lu was rather calm and spoke to the others in a commanding tone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xu Lu’s words weren’t only directed at the other five immortal rank experts, but also the spirit dominator rank experts in the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The burning silver devil flames formed half the wall, while the burning black devil flames formed the other half. Everyone was trapped by the devil in its black and silver domain. If they tried to escape, they would be burned to a crisp by the devil flames before they even exited the domain!</p>
 <p>Divine Sect Xu Lu’s words naturally contained a trace of intimidation, especially since most of the people present had descended into a state of panic.</p>
 <p>Given that the immortal rank Poison Tooth Beast had been easily killed, the devil would have no problems killing them!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The average strength of the 100 people from the five great factions was the middle class and high class dominator. They began to gather around the six immortal rank experts under the shadow of death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the navy’s Xue Yingfeng saw these dominator rank soul pets all run towards them, he couldn’t help but coldly smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Divine Sect’s Xu Lu indeed was no kind man. He obviously wanted these 100 spirit dominator experts to become cannon fodder!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Immortal rank strength was far stronger than dominator rank strength. Often, numbers didn’t mean much. Xu Lu wasn’t just an average level of ruthlessness. Indeed, a number of the 100 spirit dominator rank members were from his own Divine Sect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Xu Yingfeng wouldn’t point it out. The devil in front of them was able to instakill the Poison Tooth Beast. This was more than enough to demonstrate that his strength was above everyone here. Moreover, it was far above everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It would be very difficult for dominator rank experts to escape a domain released by a creature of this level. Rather than slowly be tormented to death by the devil flames, it was better for these people to become cannon fodder and exhaust the strength of the devil in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two devil flames still carried two different traits of evil as they burned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu’s fiendish eyes indifferently watched the invaders gather around the six immortal rank experts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu was indifferent about this. Everyone here was bound to die anyway. It didn’t matter if they grouped up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In fact, by grouping up, all they were doing was speeding up their deaths!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In front of immortal rank devil flames, these middle class and high class dominators were too weak!&nbsp;</p>
