 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang was familiar with the workings of the chaotic space. Due to owning a Strange Mane Demon, he had often encountered spacetime currents and spatial storms when entering and exiting some of the isolated spaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, drifting between the two realms for a long time like that was a first for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without oxygen, food or water, he had to continue avoiding the devastation from the chaotic space. It was absolutely fortunate for him that he was able to survive from such a collapsed space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, Chu Tianmang had fallen unconscious before he could return to the normal space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not remember really anything after he had fallen unconscious. He only sensed that someone was carrying him to a certain place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the numbness from his body, he opened his eyes hazily. He noticed that he was lying on a bed in a well decorated room. A silver new moon symbol was drawn on the ceiling above him. The afternoon sunlight was shining gently onto a jadestone table beside the window. There were medicines and herbs of various hues spread out on top of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning his gaze slightly to the side, he saw a blushing girl standing next to him who was focusing on tending to his wounds. She did not seem to notice that he had woken up......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahem,” Chu Tianmang coughed lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re awake?” The girl revealed a smile on her face and it looked rather pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang did not reply, he only focused on this girl who had helped with his treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is New Moon Palace, uncle Bai Yu had saved you and he had asked me to treat your injuries,” The girl seemed to be rather lively and told Chu Tianmang the situation oh her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Palace?” Chu Tianmang was surprised by what she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, you must have heard it before, right?” said the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Chu Tianmang would have never thought that he would be rescued by someone from the New Moon Palace, and the famous Half Devil Bai Yu at that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was trapped between the realms, he could only sense someone who similarly possessed the spatial ability nearby. So, he kept knocking on the space within that region and hoped that the other party could somehow chip open a small hole in the space. He had never expected such a coincidence would occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang and Bai Yu had a little friendship from back in New Moon Land. At that time, Bai Yu had not become a half devil yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After so many years, Bai Yu could not properly recognize him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rather normal since his face was now full of scars. There was no way Bai Yu could really recognize him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention Bai Yu, even Liu Binglan probably could not recognize him as he was now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Honor Female Supreme, you have arrived,” Suddenly, a sweet voice of a maidservant came from outside the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang immediately recognized the light and orderly footsteps. This caused him to feel slightly awkward.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of the devil, did she find out already?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pleaes don’t move. Your body is covered in wounds, just lie down. Her Honor Female Supreme may seem cold from the outside, but she’s a nice person inside,” whispered the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang smiled bitterly in reply. How could he not know whether she was nice or not?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after, a beautiful, charming and mature woman walked into the room from behind the screen. Her elegant robe perfectly emphasized her serene and noble aura, as well as her well proportioned body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had an astonishingly beautiful face that could easily mesmerize people. Of course, if that face did not display a coldness that rejected everyone, it would have been even more perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang had not seen her from up close in a long time. He had to admit that, no matter how many years had passed, her beauty was still truly captivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many youths would clearly space out for a long time after they saw Liu Binglan. They would even mess up their own words and become fairly nervous. Chu Tianmang was not as inexperienced as them after all. After snapping back to reality, he examined Liu Binglan’s expression very seriously, trying to see if she had recognized him......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, Liu Binglan had an icy expression on her face most of the time. Her gaze showed no signs of fluctuation of her emotions at all. Chu Tianmang could not even make a guess as to what she was thinking. So he decided &nbsp;to simply talk and silently hoped that the scars on his face to be either very little, or way too many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How’s his injury?” asked Liu Binglan after taking a glance at the girl who greeted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s mostly fine, just that there are quite a lot of wounds all over his body and it will be really difficult to treat them,” answered the girl with blushed cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Use these medicines,” Liu Binglan opened her spatial ring and passed the medicines that were refined by Ye Qingzi to the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I have already applied the ointment to his wounds. Once the medicinal effect of those ointments is absorbed, I will change to these,” replied the girl positively. She carefully put these medicines into another medicine cabinet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan approached the bed and closely examined this refugee who was covered in wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long silence, Liu Binglan looked at the eyes of the refugee and spoke, “Have we ever met before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang’s heart instantly skipped a beat, thinking:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It shouldn’t be possible. I’m already this disfigured, how can she still recognize me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang and Liu Binglan did not really hold a wedding ceremony. The time that they were together was also not as long as most of the other married couples. If not for Chu Mu, they would probably have been on their own paths by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang was really confused. His physique should have already changed greatly after so many years had passed. Be it his size, facial shape, gaze and aura, he was a completely different person from his past now. In addition to that, his body was now full of wounds and ointment, she should definitely not be able to recognize him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I was assaulted on Zhengming City’s street last time, were you the one who helped me? I remember your eyes,” Liu Binglan continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“......” Chu Tianmang opened his mouth and was about to admit to his identity, but Liu Binglan’s words had abruptly stopped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it’s from that matter, looks like she didn’t recognize me.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Chu Tianmang heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it’s me,” Chu Tianmang went along with Liu Binglan’s words and nodded in reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you help me?” asked Liu Binglan perplexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Passed by,” replied Chu Tianmang shortly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh,” Liu Binglan did not probe any further and spoke, “Rest and recover from your wounds.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing those words, Liu Binglan turned around and briskly left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passed by? Liu Binglan naturally would not believe that he had saved her just because he happened to have passed by. However, since he was unwilling to speak about it, she also could not force him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang took half a month to recover himself. Bai Yu had visited him once during this period, but the two of them did not really talk much. Liu Binglan had visited him another two times. Chu Tianmang had too many things to take into consideration, so he did not really reveal anything......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half a month had passed, the masked Chu Tianmang bade farewell. Liu Binglan did not pay much attention about that. He had saved her once before, she had also helped him recover. So they both did not owe each other anything anymore. She naturally was not going to stop him if he wanted to leave. Just that it was unfortunate that she could not manage to recruit such an expert to New Moon Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the New Moon Palace, Chu Tianmang went straight to Mu City. His injuries had not really fully recovered yet, just that he could move around freely now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching Mu City, he went directly into a private pavilion. Two statue-like men were guarding the pavilion. When they saw Chu Tianmang walking in, they immediately greeted respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang quickly climbed to the highest floor of the pavilion. After passing through a few screens, he could clearly see a noble-looking woman half leaning on the fence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The back of that woman seemed to be a little lonely and gloomy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was another person standing next to that woman. He was middle-aged and had dark skin. He seemed really plain and might easily go by unnoticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Tianmang was a little surprised after he saw him. He was the famous Dark Hand of the Darkness Sect. His strength was really close to those leader rank people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never really managed things in the Darkness Sect and was always uncontactable. However, he had showed up in Mu City this time and seemed to be acting as a guard. Did the terrifying Darkness Sect Magnate scheme something again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not dead yet?” Dark Hand saw that the person approaching them was the rumored dead Heaven Slaughter and revealed a surprised expression on his dark-skinned face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tenacious,” answered Chu Tianmang plainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the woman heard Chu Tianmang’s voice, she immediately turned around and her gloominess was immediately replaced by surprise and excitement instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was left speechless. She just rushed towards Chu Tianmang and held his waist tightly as she dove into his bosom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Miss......” Dark Hand did not expect her to really behave like that and was unsure whether to stop her or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang was also startled by her actions. He did not think that Miss Si would suddenly hug him like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fragrance lingered and a soft body in his bosom, Chu Tianmang knew that Miss Si was excited because of his survival and could not just push her away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I...... I was just thinking of a way to avenge you...... but now...... you’re actually alive......” said Miss Si incoherently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has that Chief also escaped?” asked Chu Tianmang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, he’s also heavily wounded,” replied Miss Si.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang took a slight distance from Miss Si discreetly and spoke, “I will handle it myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chief kept going after his life time after time, he had already grown quite furious. Once he gained the seventh Monument Tear, he would definitely make Chief pay dearly with his blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heaven Slaughter, why did you save that person? If you hadn't save him, then you would have been safe,” asked Miss Si.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang took a glance at Dark Hand. He did not really want Dark Hand to hear some of these things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miss Si also understood the meaning of Chu Tianmang’s glance, she led Chu Tianmang into another room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Si Yumi, I told you that before I had joined Darkness Sect, I had a son,” said Chu Tianmang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that him?” asked Si Yumi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This time, New Moon Palace had saved me. I rested there for half a month,” said Chu Tianmang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You met with that woman? I know that she’s currently in Zhengming Main City,” Si Yumi’s tone was rather strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We did.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, past love reignited?” continued Si Yumi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianmang took a glance at Si Yumi. He somehow felt that her tone was rather weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He and Liu Binglan were husband and wife. Although it was in name only now, they did not seek new partners after separating. It was normal to hold lingering feelings. How could she call it past love reignited?</span></p>
