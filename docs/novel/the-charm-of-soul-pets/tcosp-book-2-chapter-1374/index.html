 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Han Erxing lost, he actually lost......” Xin Xin watched the battlefield absentmindedly in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Horn Beast was already lying coldly in a pool of it's own blood. Its life force had been greatly depleted. It no longer had any reserve strength left to continue fighting against the opponent. This was no different from losing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Xin had a clear understanding of Han Erxing’s strength. If Han Erxing had lost, then that meant that he also would probably not be able to defeat Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, Chu Mu’s soul pet was clearly a level away from the near Immortal rank. Yet Chu Mu was able to defeat Han Erxing, this was a clear indication Chu Mu’s irrefutable strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really underestimated him,” said Tang Zhuo plainly, his emotion could not be guessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since Chu Mu had defeated Han Erxing, then regardless of whether he could obtain the final victory or not, he would become a dazzling new star in the Zhengming Main City after replacing Han Erxing. Of course, that was true only if he could still stay alive. Based on the understanding that Tang Zhuo had about Han Erxing, he knew that he would definitely not be tolerant of the existence of such a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Tang Zhuo also could not tolerate the presence of such a person. If there was a chance, then it would be best to finish off Chu Mu as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle had fundamentally reached an end at this point. Han Erxing’s Heaven Horn Beast threw in one final struggle before it was swept away by Mo Xie’s tail into a Hovering Mountain after fracturing many of its bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Land, Chu Mu wins,” announced the main referee Mu Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That announcement had pulled back all the spectators back from their absentminded state. The battle was naturally spectacular, nobody would be able to forget the agile figure of that Fox Noble and the eruption of the intense flame it possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even when Mu Xie had announced the outcome, everyone was still drowning in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The defeated side was the Divine Sect’s Han Erxing, a famous young expert in the entire Zhengming Main City. Some people have even ranked him as the second strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was now replaced by a youth who had suddenly appeared out of nowhere just like that. Apart from a brief period of ups and downs at the beginning, the entire battle was rather spectacular yet it was without any suspense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking onto the battlefield full of pride, yet returning back to the participant seat in complete defeat, Han Erxing did not recover for a long time after getting back to his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cheers were rumbling in his ears. He did not know why those people who had been supporting him just earlier would turn their backs on him and instead applaud for some random brat. The admiration of those girls that should have been his, yet now they were all given to that detestable brat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The feeling of having his glory snatched from him caused his entire body to start spasming. Especially after seeing Xin Xin, Tang Zhuo, Lu Fenxue and the others giving him looks that contained traces of pity, the rage boiling in his heart shot up to the threshold!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing swept a glance at Chu Mu filled with evil intentions. He was naturally thinking about killing Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he would definitely not be making the move himself. There were plenty of strong people behind him. As long as he sent any decent subordinate of his father, Chu Mu could be easily removed. He would also be able to uproot that tiny New Moon Land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that you are acquainted with Lü Fengnan?” Han Erxing inquired Tang Zhuo in a chilling tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Somewhat,” Tang Zhuo nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Doesn’t he want to get rid of Ye Qingzi?” asked Han Erxing without hiding his true intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I will introduce you to him,” Tang Zhuo smiled and did not say anything further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing was no fool. He certainly possessed enough manpower under his disposal, but the Old Sect Master Xiao clearly favored Ye Qingzi and Chu Mu. So the best choice of action was to borrow the strength of another faction. Only then would he not get suspected later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of what Han Erxing was plotting in the dark, he had still lost the battle in the end. Next, he would probably be fighting for the third position of the competition against Xin Xin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The top three positions were originally reserved for the three of them without any sense of suspense. However, the sudden appearance of Chu Mu had shattered that very situation. Chu Mu would even be fighting against Tang Zhuo three days later for the champion title.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s consecutive victories had allowed the New Moon Land’s reputation to soar up. Liu Binglan had already begun deploying some trustworthy subordinates to be stationed in the Zhengming Main City and build a branch palace of the New Moon Palace &nbsp;here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Funds, resources, New Moon Land did not lack any of those. What they did lack was the glory and reputation which they had acquired in this occasion. If Chu Mu could obtain the final victory, then the New Moon Land would completely morph from a tiny private territory to a hot cradle full of powerful experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Outstanding Expert Competition was an authoritative competition between the youths from various top notch factions. Many ancient households and old time factions had expended immense effort into it and yet they could not let their young generations enter the finals, but then a soul pet trainer from a tiny private territory had become a new star who had defeated all the other factions. How astonishing would that news be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Han Erxing is a narrow-minded person. He should definitely be scheming something to kill you, and even us,” Ye Qingzi reminded Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing would become an enemy without any chance of forming an alliance, Chu Mu had long been mentally prepared in regards to that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I will be careful, and tell others to be cautious as well,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing had once claimed he would kill him on the streets. This was something that was almost impossible to happen. No matter how powerful his backing was, it was plain suicidal to blatantly commit murder out on the street of the Zhengming Main City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, while it was easy to avoid &nbsp;hostility out in the open, it was difficult to guard against assaults from the dark. Chu Mu would never lower his guard against Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu disliked being in a passive position. Since Han Erxing would very likely come looking for trouble, Chu Mu would also not let him have a good time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What was wrong with you before the start of the match, your gaze seemed different?” asked Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi has always been carefully observing Chu Mu’s every word and action. She was undoubtedly still angry at him, but her care for Chu Mu did not lessen a tiny bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monument Tear Individual. I sensed the trace of a Monument Tear Individual before the match,” replied Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had already told Ye Qingzi about matters related to the Monument Tear Individuals. After Ye Qingzi heard Chu Mu’s answer, she also showed an astonished expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Zhengming Main City was full of danger. If Ye Qingzi knew that it would turn out like this, then she would have never allowed Chu Mu to come here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I sent Yu Suo to investigate first, she will bring back the results soon,” Chu Mu tapped Ye Qingzi’s shoulder to tell her not to worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to their residence, Yu Suo appeared in front of Chu Mu in a moment as expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had wrapped herself up in proper attire this time. Other than her long hair, it was hard to recognize her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have you found out who it is?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo shook her head and answered, “The population flow between the Hovering Mountain 10 to 15 is rather large.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo’s heart of flower was in Chu Mu’s possession. If Chu Mu accidentally got killed, then Yu Suo would also die along with him. Despite hating Chu Mu to the core, she would be even more anxious than him if Chu Mu’s life was in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not a single clue?” asked Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A little. There are three individuals with the greatest suspicion. The first is the Xuan Gate Immortal School’s Gu Xisha. He should have been at the Main Hovering Mountain, but went to the spectator seat on the Hovering Mountain 10 for some reason. Gu Xisha is a famous poison master. If he is a Monument Tear Individual, then he is definitely a Fake one. There were countless Immortal rank people who died at his hands. Amongst them, many were killed without any reason. I think his chances are greater,” explained Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gu Xisha......” Ye Qingzi also seemed to know that name and shuddered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The second?” urged Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The second is a masked man. When I sent men to trail after him, they were all killed. This person is a little mysterious,” said Yu Suo calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The third is Beiming City’s City Lord Xia Yin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is Xia Yin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is a real expert amongst the younger generation who can look down on this Outstanding Expert Competition. He is the King of a private territory just like you. For some reason, his name is only famous amongst the Immortal rank. He had no master nor any powerful faction behind his back. Yet nobody wants to offend him, including the Immortal rank in the Zhengming City,” replied Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, the possibility of him being a Monument Tear Individual is also very high,” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Monument Tear Individuals were all powerful. This Xia Yin had already become famous amongst the Immortal rank despite being so young. Perhaps only the identity of &nbsp;a Monument Tear Individual could explain that talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it’s him, then things will be better. You can get acquainted with him and exchange information. This will be beneficial to both of you. He should not be a Fake Monument Tear Individual, but I don’t know why he isn’t sitting on the main Hovering Mountain......” said Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He probably doesn’t want to attract any attention,” guessed Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“True. People like him cannot just show their faces to the public easily. I will try to maintain some contact with him. If a chance comes by, then you can meet him. Before my kingdom completely takes shape, gaining a friend with great potential is a good thing,” analyzed Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t this something that you’re the best at?” &nbsp;Chu Mu raised his brows. He did not understand why Yu Suo wanted him to be the one interacting with Xia Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Some people are naturally cautious of others. This Xia Yin belongs to that category. I had intended to bring him to our side, but he seems to be especially on guard against me after just meeting me once,” said Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s rare for someone to see through your disguise in the first meeting,” Chu Mu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo grimly retorted, “Unlike someone who was totally charmed by me during the first meeting that he even paid the price of two soul contracts and soul possession.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ye Qingzi heard that line, she immediately realized that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, a black light flashed and Yu Suo had suddenly disappeared from the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?” asked Ye Qingzi unhappily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Locking her up in the soul pet space just because of a little conflict like this, Chu Mu was really low on tolerance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu cracked a smile and reasoned, “She has been rather busy organizing her faction in this Zhengming Main City lately, she must have not rested for a long time. I’m just worried about her fragile health and so I sent her back to her nest to rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing Yu Suo was really a piece of cake, unlike the Evil Good Queen who always gave him a headache.</span></p>
