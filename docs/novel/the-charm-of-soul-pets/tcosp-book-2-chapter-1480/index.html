 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many monsters were still roaming near Ice City. These monsters didn’t seem to know that the inner Ice Mountain had completely collapsed. Thus, as low rank monsters, they were blindly and ignorantly roaming nearby.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The glacier land occupied a lot of land, so it wasn’t too realistic to deploy troops in hopes of eradicating all of the monsters. Now that Chu Mu had already defeated the core of the monsters, they lacked a leader. Thus, the low ranking monsters would gradually disappear later.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the time it took for them to gradually disappear, Ice City would be uninhabitable. Therefore, when he returned Chu Mu had to move these people to the safer Snow City. When these monsters completely disappeared, they could once more rebuild Ice City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With New Moon Navy leading the way, they would probably be able to successfully migrate the citizens. However, the migration of a few ten thousand people was still an enormous migration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice City suffered the heaviest destruction, but after Chu Mu mobilized the troops, this area of seventy cities had gone back to peace, and no longer suffered casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy and many experienced soul pet trainers frequently moved on the glacier land, systematically eradicating the remaining Ice Mountain Monsters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">About half a month later, the icy region finally returned to its usual tranquility. The various cities in the area began reconstruction as they gradually went back to normal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outbreak of the disaster had been too sudden. When considering that one of the Ancient Flood Dragon Person’s subjects had awakened, Chu Mu sent a few people to monitor any movement in the Wind Palace. This would prevent another horrifying disaster from appearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This disaster was a clear indication to Chu Mu that the Ancient Flood Dragon Person’s prescence was growing closer. If he didn’t have the strength to defeat it before it awakened, New Moon Land would no longer exist, no matter how prosperous it was!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to New Moon Land, Chu Mu focused on training.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a certain day, Chu Mu called Ning Maner over and had him accompany him as he cultivated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner was a girl who just liked having fun. If she diligently cultivated, her nurturing abilities would easily be able to create more immortal rank soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Often times when Chu Mu pulled this girl over to cultivate, she would pout and bitterly say: “Big brother is so boring. You cultivate all day and never play with me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu had returned this time, the Extreme Sky Ice Beast’s appearance made Chu Mu feel threatened. Therefore, he made Ning Maner stop playing around and accompany him to cultivate for a period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s strange, why aren’t you complaining today?” Chu Mu discovered that Ning Maner was obediently accompanying him, and was astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard from Big Brother Teng Lang that many people had been killed by monsters in this disaster,” said Ning Maner faintly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, there were serious casualties.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought about this, he felt helpless. The disaster had broken out too suddenly. Also, very strangely, why didn’t he receive the urgent correspondence?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner had a good and honest personality. Thus, the disaster made her feel bad. She wanted to do something about this disaster, but what she could accomplish was limited. Only by diligently training and helping Chu Mu raise his strength could these chaotic events be pacified.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, she didn’t try and procrastinate when Chu Mu made her cultivate this time as she obediently followed him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, can these kinds of disasters not happen in the future?” softly asked Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s hard to say.” Chu Mu himself didn’t know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were still many high bloodline creatures in the wind palace that hadn’t awakened. This time, merely a single Extreme Sky Ice Beast had brought Snow City’s area such a serious disaster. If a stronger creature appeared, how much destruction would it create?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Will big brother protect New Moon Land?” asked Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll try my best.” Chu Mu forced a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t even know how strong the Ancient Flood Dragon Person was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like New Moon Land and the people here. I don’t want them to get hurt or die.” softly said Ning Maner, “Aunt Liu is working really hard and big brother is diligently cultivating. Big sister is also not stopping as he learns even higher immortal methods. The others are all increasing their strength. Everyone is protecting New Moon Land and working hard for it. I also need to do something for New Moon Land.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu patted her wavy hair. He felt somewhat gratified.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that this disaster had made Ning Maner grow up. She was no longer only searching for other people’s protection. Instead, she wanted to protect others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But wasn’t the Messiah Tree the same? It had many protectors, but it also protected countless species and continuously proliferating organisms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps Ning Maner was weak now, and could only provide a bit of immortal aura to Chu Mu. however, increasing his strength was equivalent to protecting New Moon Land. When Ning Maner became stronger, she wouldn’t only be able to protect the tiny New Moon Land. She might even be able to protect the entire Zhengming Continent or even all of humanity…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner being willing to focus on cultivation was a huge boon to Chu Mu. Indeed, she had practically become his exclusive aide as she provided all of her immortal aura to him. Chu Mu only needed to raise training percentage and his soul pets would be able to rise ranks even quicker.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivation couldn’t rely solely on quiet cultivation; fighting was also a necessary part of Chu Mu’s cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu planned on going to Northern Ice Forbidden Region next to train. Ning Maner would go with him, thus raising Chu Mu’s cultivation speed by manifold!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That night, Ning Maner sat concentrated next to Chu Mu, helping Chu Mu’s Night increase in strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner’s immortal aura was different from the majority of soul crystals and other immortal items. With Ning Maner, Chu Mu didn’t need to guide the immortal aura. All he needed to do was keep accepting the immortal energy transferred from Ning Maner and then direct it into his soul pets’ bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without guiding, it was still practically impossible to fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One aspect of a soul pet rising a rank relied on the soul pet itself breaking through and training. When it reached the rising rank process, it would use the impetus from immortal items to successfully rise a rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, if its cultivation wasn’t enough and it hadn’t reached the conditions to rise in rank and used the help of not very effective immortal items, this would lead to a failure to rise in rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This problem didn’t exist with Ning Maner’s immortal aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If, for example, the soul pet’s cultivation was not enough, Ning Maner’s immortal aura would have a nurturing effect that would make up for this inadequacy. It was equivalent to directly increasing the soul pet’s training percentage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the making up was complete, the remaining immortal aura would continue to nurture and help the soul pet breakthrough!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner was probably the only one in this world with such a nurturing effect. It was no wonder those leaders were frantically trying to fight over her. With such a unique existence, increasing their strength would only become a matter of time. This was crucial as there were numerous immortal rank bottlenecks, especially the last one to the undying rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Monument Tears were uncertain and vague. Whether they could help humans enter the undying rank had always been a mystery. On the other hand, the Messiah Tree, in theory, was very likely to help humans enter the immortal rank. Therefore, those leader rank experts that longed to become the god of their species would go crazy over this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner slowly poured the immortal aura into Night’s body. Night cultivation had reached a very high percentage so Ning Maner just needed to use her immortal aura as a helping hand to aid Night in successfully breaking through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the immortal aura continuously increased, the breakthrough wave in Night’s mind kept growing higher and thicker. Chu Mu was able to use his soul remembrance to feel that Night’s breakthrough wave was almost higher than the cultivation threshold required for the low class immortal rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dark energy engulfed the courtyard. This courtyard had been specifically built according to Chu Mu’s requirements and could withstand a very strong energy blow. Otherwise, the courtyard would have already been repeatedly rebuilt with someone like Chu Mu, who would break through the immortal rank every few days. In fact, it could cause the entire New Moon Palace to shake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was late at night, and the darkness kept growing thicker and thicker. Wanxiang City’s lamps weren’t even able to illuminate anything. The entire Wanxiang City was covered by a dark haze. It was impossible to see past one’s fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many experts stationed in Wanxiang City. When they felt the phenomenon, they jumped up onto their roofs and cautiously stared at the location from where the darkness aura was coming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Which fellow’s soul pet is breaking through.” in a dark residence, Cloud Gate Elder was wearing an overcoat, and sleepily stared at the center of the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next door courtyard, Yu Bo walked out and also stared in the direction of New Moon Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s where that brat Chu Mu is, right? Another one of his soul pets is breaking through. From the aura it’s emitting, it should be the low class immortal rank!” Yu Bo spoke with Cloud Gate Elder from the other side of the wall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This brat’s cultivation speed is extremely fast. I remember last time he was in the inner city, his Night Thunder Dream Beast had entered the immortal rank. But this time it’s already at the low class immortal rank.” said Cloud Gate Elder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s nothing. Did you not see the Martial Cloud Dragon that brat brought back?” said Yu Bo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could I miss it? That dragon made me jump in fright when it entered the city!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right? A middle class immortal rank Martial Cloud Dragon. I wonder where Chu Mu managed to trick one from. It’s even willing to help us protect Sealed Tower. Calling Wanxiang City a place of hidden dragons and crouching tigers doesn’t even do it justice now,” said Yu Bo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“AI, I’m sure in a few years us old fellows won’t be of any use.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not the case. Indeed, don’t you feel that the outside is a bit too peaceful?” said Yu Bo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Outside? Are you referring to Zhengming Continent?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. New Moon Land’s development is too fast. It’s unbelievably fast. It would be strange if those factions were indifferent to this. From my understanding of them, they shouldn’t be this quiet.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t pay attention to foreign matters. Perhaps they've been restricted by your people over there?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hidden Pupil Royalty won’t pay attention to this. Moreover, I don’t believe that nobody in the family is feeling at ease with New Moon Land’s rate of growth.”&nbsp;</span></p>
