 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi had come to pick up Chu Mu and the others, planning first to bring them to Divine Sect. This way they would be able to catch up more; additionally, Ye Qingzi was cultivating in Divine Sect, and when her closed-door cultivation ended, Chu Mu would be able to see her right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu didn’t have any interest in going to Divine Sect. &nbsp;That place was someone else’s territory. Although Mu Qingyi had a bit of status there, this didn’t mean the entire Divine Sect belonged to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, since they had come to a city, they wanted to see the city’s scenery and characteristics. Not only did he not have any interest in going to Divine Sect, but Ning Maner, Pang Yue, and Liu Binglan also didn’t have an interest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they normally did, Chu Mu went to a flourishing yet quiet part of the city to rent a residence where everyone could stay.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi was very meticulous, and she knew that Liu Binglan didn’t like using rooms that had been used by others before. Thus, she had Xu Daofeng find a residence that was just built which no one else had lived in before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entry requirements for Zhengming Main City were very high. To a lot of people, being able to enter the city itself would be the highest honor of their lives, let alone being able to have their own residence in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If just Chu Mu, Ye Wansheng, and Chao Lengchuan had come, Xu Daofeng would just find any random area where they could stay. They were rather familiar with each other already. The most important thing was to just have fun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this time, they had been accompanied by New Moon Land’s Female Supreme Liu Binglan, the fairy-like beauty Ning Maner, as well as Pang Yue, who had taken Xue Daofeng’s breath away. If he let these beauties live in any part of the city, that would be inexcusable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Xu Daofeng resigned himself to part with his own possessions and let Chu Mu and the others stay at his own private residence that he had received once he became an Upper Official. From his own unwilling expression, he probably hadn’t even had a chance to live in this residence yet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xu Daofeng, I really didn’t expect you to be so stingy. It’s just a residence. When you come back to Wanxiang City, I’ll let you choose any of the grand and large residences.” Ye Wansheng obviously enjoyed touching on sore spots and purposefully made fun of Xu Daofeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Daofeng was speechless. This man was taking over his residence but was still making fun of him. How could Wanxiang City’s land be compared to Zhengming Main City’s? Indeed, a residence here was priceless, and even some wealthy people weren’t able to purchase them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine, you said it. I’ll choose a place in Wanxiang City. Recently, when I’ve been setting off on journeys, I’ve occasionally heard information about New Moon Land. Your New Moon Land is quite famous now. If it wasn’t so far away, I’m sure many people would want to make a trip there. Also, I heard that your Xiangrong City is a stunning city that is full of butterflies that carry the fragrance of flowers…” said Xu Daofeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Listening to Xu Daofeng’s words, Pang Yue smiled and said: “New Moon Land’s land is very limited. The price of a residence in Wanxiang City is about 10 thousand Xuan. You won’t be suffering a loss.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“10 thousand Xuan. Yes, that’s rather high… wait, what? Ten thousand Xuan?!” Xu Daofeng suddenly realized something wasn’t right and stared at Pang Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Do you not believe it?” said Pang Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Daofeng’s expression revealed that he believed that it was merely a fantasy. Who would be willing to spent 10 thousand Xuan in a distant land just to purchase a residence? 10 thousand Xuan was capable of nurturing a high class dominator rank soul pet. It was actually very close in value to his own residence in Zhengming Main City. Could New Moon Land’s land be even more expensive than Zhengming Main City’s?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Land’s land is limited, so the price is high. Most of the land is given to special status people to live in. It is rarely sold on the market.” calmly said Liu Binglan. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But… but that still doesn’t make it worth 10 thousand Xuan! Even if you said 1 thousand Xuan, I still wouldn’t believe you.” said Xu Daofeng very frankly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next to him, Yu Bo stroked his beard and smiled as he said: “I didn’t believe it at first either. But after I came to learn of something, I felt that 10 thousand Xuan actually wasn’t excessive.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, is Wanxiang City’s land really that expensive? Why didn’t I know?” At this point, Chu Mu weakly butted in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group was rendered speechless. Even Liu Binglan rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Chu Mu, are you sure you’re New Moon Land’s king…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s a training fanatic. He doesn’t care about anything else.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The adjacent Yu Bo coughed to cover his speechless expression and then said: “Chu Mu, do you not know the use of the Sealed Tower?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do know.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sealed Tower was similar to Immortal City’s independent space. Inside were countless sealed soul pets that had committed crimes. It would then slowly refine their souls into a special aura that covered the entire city. The people living in the city would be nourished by this aura, and even people who didn’t cultivate would have their lives prolonged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the aura should be very weak, and have an imperceptible effect. It probably wasn’t enough to raise the value of a single residence in Wanxiang City to 10 thousand Xuan, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After a series of discussions I had with the various large border territories, I had them move a few prisoners and imprisoned soul pets that were awaiting the death penalty into our Sealed Tower and Immortal City. This way, the evil energy inside them could be refined into energy that everyone could absorb, and it entered every Wanxiang City house. The Xuan and Spirit energy created is a very expensive resource. That’s why the prices of our Wanxiang City residences are so expensive.” Liu Binglan gave a rough explanation to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan wasn’t a ruthless and greedy person. When the prisoners and imprisoned soul pets were placed inside Sealed Tower, they would be released after their life energy had been weakened to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, these prisoners that were originally awaiting a death penalty were more willing to sacrifice the strength they had obtained to have a chance to live. By sending the death row inmates of the Border Territories into Sealed Tower, Liu Binglan was both providing the city with an unending source of Xuan and Spirit aura, while also doing a good deed of saving these prisoners’ lives. Indeed, Liu Binglan had to spend money in order to purchase them from these Border Territories.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps there were countless cultivators who had come to Wanxiang City and had a taste of the unending supply of Xuan aura. This made them more than willing to stay in Wanxiang City. And for those that weren’t able to stay, they would spread the word about this when they left New Moon Land, enshrouding New Moon Land with an even thicker layer of mystery!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this really the case? I’ve heard about this before, but I never listened closely. Does it mean that just by living there, my soul pets will be able to advance by themselves?” said Xu Daofeng with shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It only increases the chances by a certain amount, while also increasing the success rate of strengthening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan’s words immediately made Chu Mu think of the external helping force he had when he helped Night breakthrough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to Ning Maner’s nurturing aura, the helping force was negligible. However, during that crucial moment, it had helped him a great deal since even lacking a little bit when breaking through would often lead to failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really never expected your New Moon Land to have developed to such an extent. Speaking of which, your New Moon Land has many secrets. Haha, so I can have a residence in Wanxiang City? Ye Wansheng, you need to keep your promise!” said Xu Daofeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh, did I say something just now?” Ye Wansheng was like Chu Mu, and didn’t know about the Sealed Tower’s effect at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After everyone chose their rooms, Chu Mu inquired about Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was very curious as to why Ye Qingzi hadn’t come to see him. She should have come to immediately see him. Could it be that she knew about something and was angry at him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi is in closed-door cultivation and still doesn’t know that you’ve arrived. You guys will be a nice surprise for her.” said Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How much longer will she be in closed-door cultivation for?” asked Chu mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being separated from her for so long, Chu Mu really missed her. Especially when he saw Xiao Xiao, Chu Mu couldn’t stop thinking about Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Soon, it should be in the next few days.” faintly smiled Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that’s good.” Chu Mu couldn’t wait over these past few days. It didn’t matter to what extent his relationship with the princess developed to, Chu Mu’s heart was ultimately solely occupied by Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Qingzi spoke with me about you before she entered close door cultivation. She said she didn’t know where you had run off to, but if you still didn’t come to Zhengming Main City, she would go and look for you.” said Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. He had guessed that this was a possibility. However, when he thought of his relationship with the princess, he felt a bit guilty. How would he explain himself to Ye Qingzi?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that’s right. Do you want to see Yu Suo? I think she’s nearby.” said Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She hasn’t done any abnormal activities, right?” Chu Mu was still not at ease with this crafty and sinister woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi shook her head and said: “I also don’t know whether it’s true or not. But at the end of the day, she’s still trying her best to protect Ye Qingzi. Previously, Qingzi had a conflict with the head disciple of Xuan Sect. Initially, Yu Suo didn’t appear but later on, it was her that resolved this matter. She currently is in control of quite a bit of power in Zhengming Main City. I don’t know why it’s the case, but there are always so many experts willing to serve her.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi had an extreme hatred towards Yu Suo. However, she couldn’t help but admit that this woman really had skill. Indeed, she was able to create her own faction in Zhengming Main City in such a short period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But aside from running her own faction, she’s rather content with her place,” said Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Content with her place? Her innate character hasn’t changed. However, the difference is that the target of her plots isn’t us this time,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu wanted to kill this woman after the independence fight so that he would be able to sleep better at night. Unfortunately, Ye Qingzi wouldn’t let him, so Chu Mu just stopped paying attention to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time on their trip to Zhengming Main City, Chu Mu had already used their mental connection to sense her location. She would also know that he had come to Zhengming Main City. But Chu Mu couldn’t be bothered to see her. This way, it wouldn’t affect his mood when he saw Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman probably also didn’t want to see him. Not long ago, she was next to him, but in an instant, she had moved far away.&nbsp;</span></p>
