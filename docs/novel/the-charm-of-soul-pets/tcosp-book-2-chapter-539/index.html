However, there were three continuous soul energies being poured in. Its surging strength reached the highest interference with the usual calm.&nbsp;</span></p>

Chu Mu began to use his soul remembrance to rapidly squeeze the soul power into his own soul.</span></p>

So when the three streams of soul energy poured in, they carried a negative side effect of burning Chu Mu’s soul with a terrifyingly high temperature!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s present soul was already at a high temperature state, so the addition of the Nightmare soul energy was like adding oil to the fire!&nbsp;</span></p>

Cyan, blue, and white colored devil flames were in the midst of Chu Mu’s soul world. These three devil flames were intersecting with each other, doubling the burning effect…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the more Nightmare soul energy that Chu Mu induced, the stronger the fire would be. It was like a nightmare, whereby his entire world was filled with devil flames.&nbsp;</span></p>

A soul could be both the master of a purgatory, while also being the prisoner of a purgatory. It was going to be beaten thousands of time, and either it would be burned to a crisp, or it would be refined into an even stronger state. Tempering through fire and water!&nbsp;</span></p>

He looked like he was quietly undergoing silent breakthrough cultivation. However, as he battered against the seventh remembrance, Chu Mu wanted to give all of the soul energy to his soul. The more he provided, the higher his soul temperature would increase, and the more pain he would be in…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, no matter how difficult it was to bear or how hot it was, Chu Mu had to persevere and absorb all of the energy.

Just a little bit. If I had just a little bit more soul strength…” Chu Mu silently said.&nbsp;</span></p>

If he couldn’t muster the amount to breakthrough, then the energy would soon dissipate…&nbsp;</span></p>

Where could Chu Mu obtain the final sliver off soul pet energy? In this moment, Chu Mu couldn’t help but feel frustration. Could it be that he was destined to fail his breakthrough?&nbsp;</span></p>

It made him seem like a bronze statue being refined by flames!</span></p>

This sort of scene was extremely strange, and it was like a Nightmare was attaching itself to his body...</span></p>

When a Nightmare was unable to control devouring its master, devil flames would burn the master’s body. Chu Mu’s present situation was as if the Nightmare was devouring his soul!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiang Yiteng… our soul pets are not that White Nightmare’s opponent. Let’s give up…” Xing Yang’s face was pale white, as he looked at Nightmare Palace’s Young Master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Yiteng’s face was continuously twitching. But when he saw Chu Mu’s body being burned by devil flames, his face that was incomparably pale revealed an extremely unsightly smile. Amidst the smile was a bit of excitement and frenzy!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, he played with fire! He devoured so many Nightmares that the souls have turned around and burned his soul. His soul is too weak, and it is unable to withstand this amount of energy!!” Jiang Yiteng wantonly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You say that, but our soul pets…” Xing Yang had already lost two souls and Chu Mu’s White Nightmare had seized the battlefield. If they continued like this, all of their soul pets would be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be you want to surrender? Hmph. Even if all four of my souls are wounded, I still wouldn’t do that. He’s already gone overboard with his cultivation, and this is the best opportunity to kill him!” said Jiang Yiteng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Yiteng wasn’t someone who was willing to compromise. He would rather lose everything than accept less but stay in shape. This was his principle. Chu Mu had killed his strongest Nightmare so he would use the last of his strength to kill Chu Mu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xing Yang grit his teeth in pain. The fight had reached a point that he had never expected. As one of Nightmare Palace’s strongest, he also had his own honor. SInce Jiang Yiteng was going to resolutely stake the rest of his strength to kill Chu Mu, then he wouldn't cower in fear either. When Nightmare Palace members cultivated, they already had to prepare for their own deaths!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Demon Fairy has the ability to burn its own soul to steal another’s soul. It can prevent his White Nightmare from using techniques for ten seconds. Are you sure you can kill him in these ten seconds?” said Xing Yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Jiang Yiteng merely spat out this word coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xing Yang’s Demon Fairy had abnormal dark attribute talent. It could burn its own life force to steal another soul pet’s soul!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was normally towards soul pets weaker than it by three levels. However, Xing Yang’s Demon Fairy was weaker than Chu Mu’s White Nightmare by nearly three levels. If it used this technique, the moment it entered the White Nightmare’s body, it was equivalent to jumping into a fire pit. It would definitely be burned to a crisp within 10 seconds by the White Nightmare!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demon Fairy that could camouflage in the shadows was a strange creature. Quickly, it locked onto the White Nightmare and took advantage of the White Nightmare being slightly inhibited by the Tundra Ice Beast to suddenly transform into a shadow that shot into the White Nightmare’s shadow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nie!!!!!!!!” the White Nightmare immediately discovered something enter its body, and it let out an angry shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Nightmare wanted to use the nine underworld devil flames in its body to burn this suicidal thing. However, when it called forth its inner flames, it felt something stopping it from doing so, preventing it from controlling the devil flames on its body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nie!!!!!!” the White Nightmare became angry.</span></p>

Chu Mu was in a state of breaking through his soul remembrance, and couldn’t tell the White Nightmare how to resolve this. It could only allow this strange object to shackle his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve succeeded. You must kill him and avenge our soul pets!” Xing Yang barely managed to show a savage smile!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Yiteng nodded his head, and gave his Great Lightning Snake Lion an order!</span></p>

When the Great Lightning Snake Lion used this technique, its eardrums would rupture and its ears, nose and eyes would spill with blood!&nbsp;</span></p>
