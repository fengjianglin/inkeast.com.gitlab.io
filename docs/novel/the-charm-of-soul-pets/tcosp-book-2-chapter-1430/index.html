 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a joking voice interrupted them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody had noticed the intruder and they all turned towards the source of the voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four snow white figures had appeared unknowingly. They walked out from the rugged mountain rubbles. The person who was walking at the fore front had a confident smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had to admit that the guy possessed a rather handsome face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were few people who could possess such a handsome appearance after reaching the Immortal rank. When this Navy Ocean Lord who held the title of a handsome prince in Wupan Continent walked over confidently, his eyes swept past everyone and eventually stopped on Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou maintained a slightly levitated position from the ground. The levitated height was the same height as the high heels worn by women. Her breathtaking appearance and unique spectral aura had immediately caught the attention of this Ocean Lord Luo Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others had actually noticed Princess Jin Rou’s unique specter identity. However, they were too focused on the Monument Tear and did not care about that female specter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Princess Jin Rou noticed this sudden intruder staring at her cunningly, she immediately showed a displeased expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even as a specter, Princess Jin Rou clearly disliked a guy who was obviously the antagonist and was also really full of himself to be able to stare at her so greedily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, that man in white clothes with something on his face is really annoying. His tone also sounds really uncomfortable,” whispered Princess Jin Rou as she put her mouth near Chu Mu’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou was actually correct. Ocean Lord Luo Yi did apply something on his face in order to retain his handsome looks. As for the tone, honestly speaking, even Qin Guang and Zeng Long felt uncomfortable of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wupan Navy Seventh Ocean Lord Luo Yi, Fourth Ocean Lord Ji Gui...... Interesting. Even the Wupan Navy has come all the way to our Zhengming City to reap profits. Don’t tell me that the Wupan Continent has already become so devastated that you have no place to stay anymore?” sneered Zeng Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We were just passing by. We heard that there’s something good in the Imprint Valley, so we’re just coming to take a look,” replied Luo Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Yi and Ji Gui were quite famous amongst the Immortal rank. Ocean Lord Luo Yi had often interacted with the experts in Zhengming Continent. There were even rumors within the circle that Luo Yi cared about beauty even more than he did about women. Although he did look charming, his behavior really appeared too feminine to others. That caused many manly experts to feel cringed when they interacted with him. Fortunately, Luo Yi was still straight, or else many people would have clearly avoided him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Ji Gui was the exact opposite of Luo Yi. Ji Gui was extremely ugly and looked like a wild beast standing on two feet with a human face. Such a person just happened to be best friends with Luo Yi. This was also a partnership between two extremely powerful individuals within the Wupan Navy......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu realized that these people more or less knew one another. This meant that they were all outstanding individuals within the Immortal rank. Especially Qin Guang, Zeng Long, Luo Yi and Ji Gui, any of these four possessed the strength to fight the Martial Cloud Dragon head on. If the four of them joined hands against him, then he might truly not even be able to put up any resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This kid is also a Monument Tear Individual, right?” Luo Yi reluctantly moved his gaze away from Princess Jin Rou and stared at Chu Mu next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, Gate Master Han holds a grudge against him, I’m just coming here to kill him along the way,” replied Qin Guang plainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long was dumbfounded. Qin Guang’s ability to lie with his eyes open was really impressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Qin, there’s no need to be like this. We all came here to this Imprint Valley at the risk of our lives. There’s no benefit in fighting amongst ourselves. How about this? Let’s split the Monument Tear into three shares and leave peacefully after taking one each?” suggested Luo Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, you just come here and blabber a few words, and yet you want to obtain a share? Luo Yi, you’re really too full of yourself,” snorted Zeng Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Luo Yi raised his brows and declared, “Then it’s up to each of our abilities!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying thus, Luo Yi’s aura immediately changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of water suddenly swept up from behind him. A water devil’s figure manifested from within the wave. That monster was extremely fast. In an instant, it had already reached in front of Chu Mu along with the wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not expect the attack to come so soon and hurriedly dodged the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not know exactly what that water devil in the wave was. However, based on the aura that it exuded, this water devil was definitely not inferior to the Martial Cloud Dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people who entered the Imprint Valley this time were no weaklings. Chu Mu was currently surrounded by this group of powerful individuals and was truly at a loss on what to do. He was hesitating whether he should give up the Seven Sin Fox’s Monument Tear or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon remained standing firm in front of Chu Mu. Seeing the water devil coming, it immediately stepped forward to block the attack for Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before that water devil got near the Martial Cloud Dragon, a beautiful beast with a single crown horn on its head suddenly leaped in between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Crown Horned Beast stomped the ground violently and splattered a wave of rampaging energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The energy blasted viciously in between the Martial Cloud Dragon and the water devil. The Martial Cloud Dragon’s enormous body was forced back a few steps, while that water devil was also flung back and it landed right in front of Luo Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After failing the first attempt, Luo Yi seemed to be really annoyed now. He swept across everyone to check who had interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long and Qin Guang glanced at each other. The two of them would definitely ally with each other in this situation. They did intend to make a move, but they were too slow to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for their subordinates? That would be even more impossible. Who possessed the strength to knock back both the Martial Cloud Dragon and Luo Yi’s water devil?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has really turned into a battle royale now,” Chu Mu was the first to discover another group of people approaching. He turned his gaze and stared towards the darkness near the black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the shadow of darkness, a group of masked people gradually walked out, each of them exuding a dense killing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing aura was something that everyone possessed after they reached the Immortal rank. However, that group of people possessed really dense killing aura. Princess Jin Rou could even see faint traces of ghost aura around them as she was a specter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they appeared individually, then it would not have garnered such attention. Anyone who had reached this level would be stained in blood after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when they appeared as a group, that dense killing aura swept over and stung everyone’s skin, intimidating everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that group of people appeared, Zeng Long, Qin Guang, Luo Yi and Ji Gui frowned immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That group of people was probably an opponent that they did not wish to see the most. Regardless of the Divine Sect, Elemental Clan, Soul Pet Palace, Xuan Gate Immortal School or Wupan Navy, once things get complicated, they would normally split the loot evenly in respect of everyone’s faction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was a certain group of people without any morality at all. They would obtain anything they wanted even if it meant putting their lives on the line for it. They would kill the people they wanted to kill no matter how great the faction behind the target was. The restrain and relationship network between factions was nothing to them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the Darkness Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of selfish, murderous, rule breaking human scum!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect used such words to describe them. Most of the time, Divine Sect never even treated the members of Darkness Sect as human beings because that group of people were naturally classified as wild beasts or monsters within their minds. They would kill anything alive, just like devils who would slaughter anyone to satisfy their twisted desires!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a high ranking Divine Sect member, Qin Guang’s expression became as twisted as it could be. His face was twitching crazily and carried immense rage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This group of scum!” cursed Qin Guang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of seven masked people. One of them could easily be identified from his gaze. That was Leng Lou who had reported the situation to Chu Mu before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness Sect and Divine Sect were archenemies after all. They also had a rather poor relationship with other sects too. Most sects were dying to get rid of them. They certainly killed people without hesitation, but the members of Darkness Sect were also clearly &nbsp;just a group of people who would do anything to pursue power. The difference between them and those righteous sects like Divine Sect, Elemental Clan or Xuan Gate Immortal School was that the Darkness Sect members were not afraid of exposing their identities when they broke social rules and committed slaughter. Meanwhile, those righteous sect members would do anything to cover up their hideous acts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there were still some truly righteous factions. At least the people from those factions that Chu Mu was acquainted with were not all that greedy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heaven Slaughter, didn’t you intend to let them bite one another for a while longer? Why are we showing up so soon? If they cooperate with each other to take us on, then we will also be in a disadvantageous situation,” asked Miss Si with a low volume while she wore a mask over her face after she approached Heaven Slaughter who stood at the front most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Slaughter also wore a mask on his face and she could not see his expression. That Crown Horned Beast was obviously his soul pet. Right now, this beast was standing proudly &nbsp;in the middle of the battlefield. It did not show any signs of fear when facing off against many powerful Immortal rank soul pets in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s not a Fake Monument Tear Individual,” replied Heaven Slaughter plainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He? You mean that young man?” Miss Si took a glance at Chu Mu in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were truly not that many real Monument Tear Individuals in this world. Instead, Fake Monument Tear Individuals roamed all over the world. This had severely obstructed the communication between real Monument Tear Individuals to some extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Heaven Slaughter nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s dragon tattoos trembled slightly and he sneered, “There’s no need to hide your face. Crown Horned Beast, Northern Slaughter’s main culprit. We know that you are the crazy killer Heaven Slaughter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s Darkness Sect’s Heaven Slaughter!” Luo Yi and Ji Gui stared at the emotionless man standing at the front of the seven Darkness Sect members in utter shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the crazy killer from the Northern Incident!</span></p>
