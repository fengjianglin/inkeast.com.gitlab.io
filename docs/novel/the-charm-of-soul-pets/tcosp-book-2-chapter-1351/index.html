 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were speaking, the entire flower courtyard suddenly went silent. Despite the fragrance from the flowers around them, another even more uniquely alluring fragrance wafted in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of intoxication appeared in everyone’s eyes, and they naturally turned to look at the adjacent cobblestone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A long, holy, and blue cloud-like dress dragged along the ground as the woman gracefully strode forth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dress was both long and beautiful, but the thin material was ostensibly unable to cover her captivating figure. It was almost as if one could see through the dress, yet it was graceful at the same time. It made the eyes of every man present burn passionately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thin waist under the dress swung back and forth. It was both dignified, yet capable of making people stare at the area between her back and waist. All of the dress served to accentuate her most captivating parts, making her even more sexy and seductive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, very interestingly, while everyone wanted to keep their eyes on that location, they couldn’t stare there for too long. They had to move their eyes up and look at the woman’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that this woman had a beautiful appearance capable of making one’s heartbeat quickly. Although she would always use a veil to hide it, a single glance at her face would still make people hold their breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle, refined, dignified, holy, yet also graceful. She was both sexy and radiated a fatal attraction. She was like a respected saint that could not tolerate profanity; a graceful woman that was both pure and capable of making one’s imagination run wild. In front of such a woman, what man wouldn’t prostrate himself at the feet of her pomegranate dress?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people at the very front of the audience were the outstanding young men from the various large factions. They had seen countless women before. This included both Tang Zhuo and Xin Xin, who initially didn’t pay much attention to the Saintess. However, right now, as she was walking over, their hearts had completely changed. It seemed that all of their pride had vanished, and pursuing everything else seemed insignificant in comparison now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, we thank you for coming and being a guest at the Saintess’s Guang Moon Palace. The Saintess has received the City Lord’s support, and will gift certain people here an eternal blessing. This eternal blessing will only be obtained by suitable people. But even those who don’t receive an eternal blessing will receive a trace of the Saintess’s nurturing aura, which will help with your cultivation.” said the older woman next to the Saintess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present stood up at this moment out of etiquette, and waited for the fairy-like woman to sit down before they sat down themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of the people didn’t originally have intentions of adhering to etiquette because the status of these people represented the various large factions of Zhengming Continent to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was inappropriate for them not to adhere to etiquette since the older woman who had just spoken was not simple. She was an extremely famous female soul pet trainer in Zhengming Main City, Madam Gao. In terms of status and seniority, she sat together with their elders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this extremely high-status Madam Gao was willing to follow this Saintess, why would they dare to neglect etiquette themselves?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Being able to see the Saintess is our honor. We don’t have any excessive expectations of you.” Tang Zhuo thoughts instantly changed, and he immediately began to praise her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Zhuo is correct. Being able to see the Saintess is enough in it of itself.” Son of Wind Xin Xin immediately added.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, that’s right. Eternal blessings depends on fate. It’s not something that can be demanded.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Gao motioned for everyone to quiet down and said: “Everyone will take turns and introduce themselves. The Saintess will make a choice according to everyone’s circumstances. All you need to do is give a brief introduction. There’s no need to say too much.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saintess was still sitting there very quietly. Her bright eyes seemed like they could see through peoples’ hearts as she was slowly but elegantly examining everyone present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, her eyes landed on Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo understood that the Saintess wanted him to be the first to introduce himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo had an average appearance, and didn’t have a very tall or sturdy body. However, his temperament was rather refined and his eyes radiated unhurried confidence. He didn’t look restless nor cold. He gave off an unfathomable feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo noticed the Saintess’s eyes examining him. He felt excited inside, but he didn’t show it on the outside. He politely stood up and the corners of his mouth faintly raised as he said: “My name is Tang Zuo. I’m sure I don’t need to introduce myself any further.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, Tang Zhuo intentionally looked back at the Saintess’s eyes, and then sat down on his own accord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo’s self-introduction was rather arrogant. However, nobody was dissatisfied with this, because everyone present knew about Tang Zhuo. He only needed to say his name and everyone would know the rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saintess faintly nodded her head, and her eyes landed on the Son of Wind Xin Xin who was next to Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Son of Wind Xin Xin wasn’t as carefree and calm as Tang Zhuo. When he felt the Saintess’s beautiful eyes staring at him, he showed slight nervousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were any other outstanding woman, Son of Wind Xin Xin, who had an elegant demeanor, would be able to calmly face her. However, his eyes were completely occupied by the Saintess’s beautiful and pure eyes, and his heart was rapidly beating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Xin Xin wasn’t someone who had no life experience, and he quickly found his original elegant demeanor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Xin continued to stare at the Saintess’s eyes until Madam Gao creased her eyes unhappily. Only then did he apologetically laughed and say, “My name is Xin Xin. My nickname is Son of Wind, and I am Elemental Sect’s wind type Chief Disciple. I am like Tang Zhuo, and I’m sure everyone has crossed paths with me at some point. Thus, everyone should have a rough understanding of who I am. However, I will add that I am a single man.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Xin’s words immediately caused the atmosphere to change.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Xin was unexpectedly flirting with the Saintess! Saying, for no other explicable reason, that he was single, was essentially saying that he was interested in the Saintess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some people agreed with Xin Xin’s confident and calm laughter while others felt unhappy, thinking that Xin Xin was too frivolous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saintess still nodded her head as before. No visible change could be seen in her eyes. Clearly, Xin Xin’s flirting words hadn’t been of much use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for me to introduce myself, right. I just hope that Lady Yu… uhh, Saintess Yu will grant the eternal blessing to me. I am an honest person, and if Saintess Yu needs anything in the future, just say it. I, Han Erxing, am willing to walk through fire and tread on water for you.” said the third man who stood up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing was a Divine Sect member. From his words, he seemed to already know the Saintess. Moreover, from his mistake in the way he addressed her, he was telling everyone that he was ahead of them all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu faintly nodded her head as before. She had no intentions of speaking, and her eyes fell on the woman in the fourth seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lu Fenxue. Divine Sect Upper Official.” this woman’s introduction was very simple. However, her eyes didn’t hide her dissatisfaction towards the Saintess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fenxue obviously was unhappy with this woman whose origins were unknown. Within Divine Sect, even the most outstanding Lin Mengling didn’t call herself a Saintess. So what qualifications did this woman have to call herself one in Zhengming Main City? If she was a Saintess, then wasn’t Divine Sect’s Lin Mengling a goddess?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fenxue and Divine Sect’s Lin Mengling had good relations. Lin Mengling didn’t enjoy appearing in public, so Lu Fenxue felt unfairness for her. Thus, she obviously wasn’t going to show a friendly expression in front of this woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was the first time Lu Fenxue had seen Saintess Yu from such a close proximity. Although she was slightly moved by the Saintess’s fairy-like temperament, it was incapable of making her heart waver.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Gao ostensibly could see through Lu Fenxue’s demeanor, and her brows faintly creased. She was about to say something when Saintess Yu stopped her. Saintess Yu’s eyes moved to the next person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And thus the introductions continued on, one by one. Some people took a long time and tried to tell her all of their experiences. Other people had short introductions; their achievements didn’t need to be described and spoke for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimately, there were people here for the Eternal Blessing, and others were here to win a favorable impression or the attention of a beauty. Eventually, the introductions reached the backs seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was about to reach Huang Yufei, who was very excited. If it weren’t for Li Qingqing who was pulling him back, this fellow would have probably rushed to stand up before it was his turn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you guys know that from the moment Saintess Yu arrived, her eyes have looked at me at least five times! Li Qingqing, I’ve told you before that she definitely noticed me last time in the crowd and discovered that I was unique and outstanding. Perhaps I will obtain an Eternal Blessing this time!” Huang Yufei spoke with a face full of excitement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingqing’s face was still full of contempt. Besides narcissism, Huang Yufei didn’t have anything uniquely outstanding about him. She didn’t believe that this elegant Saintess would take a liking to this fellow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Li Qingqing was also very curious. There were a few times when she did in fact catch the saintess look this way, and then quickly shift away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, it arrived at Huang Yufei. Huang Yufei instantly stood up, and with a face full of confidence that was hard to hide the excitement in his heart, he said: “My name is Huang Yufei. I am the son of Ze Border’s Border Lord. I have always admired Saintess Yu. If I could, I would be willing to serve Saintess Yu for the rest of my life!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei was ultimately the son of an influential family and even if his heart was flipping around, he wouldn’t sound like an idiot when he spoke. Nonetheless, his brazen expression of his admiration and devotion was something the other sons were unable to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those bright eyes were still flashing with a captivating halo. It was impossible to see any changed in her emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu nodded her head as before. She didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei was originally waiting for Saintess Yu to show him a special gaze. But when he discovered that she was treating him the same as others, his heart instantly dropped, and he slowly sat back down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those spirited star-like eyes landed on Chu Mu. They were still both calm and beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu had already noticed that Chu Mu was sitting at the back. In truth, she really wanted to just skip this man, and have the next person introduce themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this would be undoubtedly telling others that she had a special relationship with this man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, when she saw his ridiculing eyes, Saintess Yu felt a trace of anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Land, Chu Mu.” Chu Mu stood up, and gave a short introduction before his mouth couldn’t help but curve into a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu immediately moved her eyes to the next person. If she stared any longer at Chu Mu, she would find it difficult to bear. The feeling she got was like merciless devil flames spreading over her entire body. It was extremely uncomfortable!&nbsp;</span></p>
