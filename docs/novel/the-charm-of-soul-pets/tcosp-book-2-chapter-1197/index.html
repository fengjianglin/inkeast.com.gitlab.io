 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lord of the southern forbidden region had already sent a Nightmare army into Wild Dog Devil Empire. However, most of the army was just cleaning up, because they discovered that nearly all the entire sixth rank empire’s stronger armies had been defeated by the dragon of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon had a number of group attacks, especially after obtaining the spectral attribute. Each dead soul attack from Ten Thousand Spectral Strikes contained powerful energy that was capable of shattering the spirits of an army. In the eyes of the Wild Dog Devils, the Little Hidden Dragon was the most terrifying slaughterer they had encountered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Corpses once more covered the completely obliterated wide span of land. The ground was covered in astonishing gulches caused by dragon clauses, bottomless abysses and naked potholes. With corpses littering the ground, it was like a scene straight from hell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the cruelty of war. Perhaps a slaughter of this scale was occurring somewhere else in the world right now, but this battlefield had been caused solely by a single soul pet; this was extremely terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commander of the Nightmare army was Nightmare Commander, First White. This Nightmare had experienced the easiest battle of its life, and if things went as expected, the credit for this battle would belong to him. Thus, the lord of the southern forbidden region would give him a huge reward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s time was limited. He left the clean up to First White, and its army while he returned to the southern forbidden region’s lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he returned, the lord was still very cordial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why would the lord dislike an expert who helped it eliminate a sixth rank empire?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It hoped that Chu Mu would be able to stay a while longer. Unfortunately, Chu Mu had to go back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had come this time to pick up his White Nightmare. The southern forbidden region’s lord didn’t disappoint Chu Mu. In the past few months, it specially trained the White Nightmare and even let the White Nightmare devour the souls of convicted White Nightmares. This allowed the White Nightmare to reach the low class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu himself was a spirit dominator, while the White Nightmare was now a low class dominator. If he transformed into a half devil, his strength would probably be much stronger than a middle class dominator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The southern forbidden region’s lord told Chu Mu that there were still a few souls in the White Nightmare’s body that had yet to be completely digested. When they were completely digested, its strength would probably rise by another one or two levels. This would make the White Nightmare’s strength near the middle class dominator rank in itself. If it transformed into a half devil, perhaps it would be able to fight Wu Zhen’s Rock Wing Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was extremely satisfied by the leap in the White Nightmare’s power in a short six months.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After I return, Zhan Ye’s spirit items will probably have been concocted. Perhaps its power will also rise.” a smile rose on Chu Mu’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu’s training the Little Hidden Dragon, Zhan Ye and his other soul pets didn’t stop fighting either. Zhan Ye’s training level was at the low class dominator rank so it only needed a xuan item to push it into this rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once its soul rank reached the low class dominator rank, the power Zhan Ye could burst out with would even be stronger than a normal middle class dominator!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The accumulation of previous training as well as the bitter six months of slaughter greatly increased the power of his three main pets. Things were very different now for Ch uMu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">En route home, Chu Mu didn’t waste time. He recalled his soul pets to his soul pet space and rode on Mo Xie to Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie’s running speed on the ground was extremely fast. The only thing she lacked was endurance. Nonetheless, the trip between the northern forbidden region and Wanxiang Realm wouldn’t take long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While running back, Chu Mu’s mind was still concerned for the Night Thunder Dream Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">NIght had still yet to return, making Chu Mu feel a bit uncomfortable. He didn’t even know what domain it had entered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He believed in Night’s willpower and talent. Its strength right now was definitely not weak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wanxiang City</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only ten days left until the fight. Bai Yu had finally ended his harsh training and appeared in Wanxiang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu still hasn’t returned?” asked Bai Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. But it’s fine. He’s normally right on time.” said Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s about time. Let’s go to Heavenly Mountain.” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The independence fight had been announced earlier and numerous people from New Moon Land had begun to travel to the location a few months ago. They crossed through the endless icy mountain world and reached Heavenly Mountain’s Cloud Gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of New Moon Land’s people had not reached the dominator rank so they really did need a few months to reach the location with their speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Mountain Cloud Gate was a boundary between two sides. New Moon Land’s citizens established a site on the western side of Cloud Gate for New Moon Land’s people.*&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Gate’s eastern side belonged to Cloud Realm’s people. The number of people gathered there were several tens of times more than New Moon Land’s side. Moreover, many had come from realms outside of Cloud Realm. From this it could be seen that the territorial independence fight was a matter of enormous magnitude to those in the world beyond Cloud Gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truthfully speaking, I truly admire the courage of your King Chu.” said Lan Yao whose eyes flashed with a charming light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Yao had spent some time now in Wanxiang City. As a dominator rank herself, the citizens of Wanxiang Realm gradually came to know her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The matter of territorial independence had been told to Chu Mu by her. However, she never expected Chu Mu would actually dare apply for territorial independence from Cloud realm. Even though she was already on the way towards the territorial independence fight, she still felt it was hard to believe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Yao came from the other side of the Dark Sky Ocean World. Although she had never been to Cloud Realm before, she knew that a seventh rank realm was overseen by many experts. If she were to tell others of a king from a third rank realm challenging the experts from a seventh rank realm, she didn’t know how many people would think it were a joke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ms. Foreign Beauty, I feel that this is merely the beginning. Perhaps you’ll hear about more of Chu Mu’s inconceivable feats in the future.” laughed Ye Wansheng. He stared straight at Lan Yao’s eyes that carried charming intentions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Yao directly threw Ye Wansheng a charming smile, causing Ye Wansheng to instantly be elated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Shen Yue who was sitting next to Ye Wansheng rudely kicked him, and angrily glared at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng awkwardly laughed. He was silently complaining about his meddlesome younger sister who had exposed the fact that he had done certain things with a few noble young ladies in Cloud Realm. This prevented him from touching even a hair on Shen Yue for over a month.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng decided very quickly to change the topic: “Uhm, I still have a bet with the old man from Cloud Gate. I am going to go pay a visit to that old man first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go together.” said Prince Chao and Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bet was very important. If they lost, not only would they be unable to step half a foot out of New Moon Land in the future, but they would also have to do something for the old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, if they won, the old man would look after the entrance to New Moon Land, or in other words, overseeing New Moon Land. Although they didn’t know how strong this old man was, someone who year in and year outstayed in this frigid land was definitely no ordinary person. Having another expert to protect New Moon Land was naturally a good thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu and Liu Binglan remained at the temporary establishment to rest, waiting for the date of the independence fight to arrive. As for Ye Wansheng, he brought a number of young experts who wanted to see the world outside of Cloud Gate to Cloud Gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time for many people coming to Heavenly Mountain. They didn’t know about the existence of Cloud gate. Many of these people who had arrived here earlier had attempted to pass through Cloud Gate, but had ultimately been stopped by the old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo had come early, and had been training in Eastern Wild Jungle. When he learned about the independence fight, he had made his way to Heavenly Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That old man is very strong. Purely through his soul remembrance suppression, I wasn’t even able to chant an incantation. I was forced to crawl back in somber spirits.” softly said Shen Mo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? He was more friendly to me. He summoned a soul pet and with a single breath, blew me back to the mountains from Cloud Gate…” Teng Lang laughed at himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teng Lang, Shen Mo, Pang Yue, Xiao Hai, and the others were all fearful of Cloud Gate’s old man. They were New Moon Land’s second group of experts and the most likely people to enter the dominator rank in the future. However, when they arrived at Cloud Gate and saw how terrifying the old man who guarded it was, they no longer had the courage to step out of New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The truth is that the outside is not that terrifying. Although our species rank is not very high, there are species with lower thanks than us. The southern side once we get past Cloud Gate is composed of servant rank humans. The realms there are even lower than ours.” said Prince Chao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, eh, that… that old man…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, an aged and icy voice rang out from the end of Cloud Gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t I tell you that nobody was permitted to enter here?!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the cold shout, Teng Lang, Shen Mo, Pang Yu, Xiao Hai, and the others all trembled. The soul pets they were riding on couldn’t help but take a few steps back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng, Prince Chao, and Mu Qingyi weren’t afraid. They walked straight up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old man, it’s us.” Ye Wansheng had no respect for the elder and just casually called out to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, you guys… the time still hasn’t come. What are you here for?” Cloud Gate’s old man recognized this glib-tongued brat and his tone warmed a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s about the thing we bet on. You aren’t thinking of reneging, are you?” said Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Gate’s old man fumingly emphasized: “Why would I renege? Don’t talk as if you guys can win! I gave you guys five years, yet you guys decided to incite this matter so quickly! What difference is this from just seeking death? Do you think that Cloud Realm is very accommodating?!!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the matter was brought up, Cloud Gate’s old man got angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had made an exception to allow those five people to pass through Cloud Gate and had even warned them with good intentions to talk about the matter of independence only after five years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, not even after two years had passed, they had decided to declare war against Cloud Realm and self-determine their territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These younger generations were too ignorant of his words!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever. A group of ignorant and arrogant people. Having them experience what a true expert is, is good too! This will put a stop to foolish conceit!” thought Cloud Gate’s old man to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
