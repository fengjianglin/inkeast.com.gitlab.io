When she lifted her head, her tear stricken eyes saw the man standing under the dim streetlights. Her mental state wavered.</span></p>

She had already decided to retract her useless weak appearance right now and go to Soul Palace to ask for help, accepting any conditions Chu Mu made.</span></p>

The other person is Zuo Xiao, who isn’t any weaker than Shen Yichen. He’s very hard to deal with.” Shang Heng knew he shouldn’t say much more, so he simply reported the battle situation to Chu Mu.</span></p>

Soon following, soul pet trainers covered in silver armor all rode their soul pets, and appeared behind Chu Mu and Shang Heng.</span></p>

When he received the command, he smiled and immediately brought the twenty silver armored Radiant Guards towards the messy battlefield!</span></p>

Shang Heng just stood behind Chu Mu. His eyes were watching Chu Mu’s back shadow, and he was secretly shocked. This man seemed never to have asked whether he could kill, yet he directly gave commands to kill. He was trying to completely kill off Shen Yichen! In the entire soul palace, no one other than the eighth young master dared to do this, neither did anyone had the guts to take the consequences!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s judgement was very accurate. Shen Yichen only brought thirty people this time. But, when they got here, they already sent fifty soul palace guards to surround the western street. Unless Shen Yichen could get help within twenty minutes, Shen Yichen’s subordinates would definitely all die here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Heng also knew that, to deal with Shen Yichen, he had to deal with all his subordinates first. So, in the following battle, it was a match between the palace guards and Shen Yichen’s subordinates. This will take a while, but Shang Heng believed that within ten minutes all their defenses would shatter!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span></p>

The most needed person appearing at her most needed time, she no longer knew how to express her feelings, only able to cover her face as she wept…….</span></p>

He didn't know how to comfort Ye Qingzi, so he simply slowly crouched down and sat beside Ye Qingzi and watched her.</span></p>

There’s a lot of soul palace people nearby, they won’t escape!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qingzi nodded heavily, but she still couldn’t stop her tears. This was the first time she had ever cried like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi wiped the tears off her face, and took a few deep breaths before adjusting her emotions. She specially glanced at Chu Mu but realized his face was a little too close to hers, so she quickly put her head down again.</span></p>

My soul teacher skills were all from him. Before, we knew nothing. Brother had always worked towards becoming a powerful soul pet teacher while I inherited our teacher’s arts to become a soul teacher at the same time as becoming a soul pet trainer. Most my soul pets therefore ended up working towards that direction too……” When she was truly sad, Ye Qingzi started reciting her own story unknowingly.</span></p>

Before, I felt it was unfair; why did I have to learn two techniques while my brother could do whatever he wanted? Therefore, our relationship was very poor before. We couldn’t even speak to each other much. I thought he must have hated me, hated my distant attitude towards everyone, while I also hated his arrogance.”</span></p>

I ran very far into the wilderness to try to leave them behind because I thought they all hated me. However, I got lost and was attacked by soul pets, causing myself to faint from blood loss.”</span></p>

It ended up with a soul pet battle. He said he could beat me with a single soul pet. I hated his arrogance, and since he indeed only summoned one soul pet, I summoned three and easily crushed him, wounding him all over……”</span></p>

I felt teacher was favoring him, so I didn’t want to stay anymore, leaving for real. I roamed outside for a long while, still hating the two of them, until I met one of teacher’s soul teacher friends who took me in and asked what happened.”</span></p>

His two souls were both wounded, and his soul was on the verge of collapsing. It took him two months to help him recover. He saved me and still hasn’t fully recovered even today, so how could I hit him?”</span></p>

I didn’t realize when brother hurt his souls and when he saved me. However, with some thinking, my entire body froze, because I remembered the time I ran into the wilderness alone and fainted after I was attacked by soul pets……”</span></p>

Saying that much, Chu Mu understood. When Ye Qingzi left into the wilderness, Ye Wansheng sacrificed two of his soul pets to save Ye Qingzi!</span></p>

Even after making such sacrifice, he acted nonchalant and continued to argue with his sister like before. “Chu Mu, you have to help me, help me save my brother. He’s already had three of his souls hurt in his soul pet trainer journey. He can’t have any more hindrances.” Reaching here, Ye Qingzi’s emotions slightly went out of control. No matter who experienced such event, they would find it hard to control their emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“”He has always tried extremely hard to become a soul pet trainer. When we were young, it wasn’t that teacher was lenient towards him, neither was it the fact that he could do anything. Instead, he simply had his own goal to work towards. He wanted to step onto the elite Realm Throne. His perseverance caused teacher’s heart to soften. Even when he was covered from head to toe in blood, he would smile. He would never let any childish grumbling or disappointment appear on his face……” Ye Qingzi no longer wanted to run away because of this. If Chu Mu didn’t appear, she would have returned. She would rather stay a soul teacher slave for her enemy for the rest of her life than let her brother sacrifice any more for her.</span></p>

Now, brother is on their hands. Chu Mu, I don’t know what to do.” Speaking of that, Ye Qingzi fell into silent tears, her grieving face seeming able to shatter even the hardest hearts.</span></p>
