 <p><strong>Chapter 288: Eighth Rank Battle Technique, Five Night Inferno Fox Diagram</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwuwu~~~~~~~~” Reaching the seventh phase, Mo Xie let out a call, as if reminding Ye Qingzi of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moon, Moonlight Conjure!” Ye Qingzi quickly understood Mo Xie and spoke to Water Moon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason water moon was called Water Moon was because, where there was Water Moon, there was the existence of water and shine of moon. In fact, as the Water Moon’s strength increased, the moonlight effect it made could surpass natural moonlight, giving soul pets who gained strength in moonlight even greater strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Water Moon could easily be killed by a Gluttonous Insect Monster in this fight, so Ye Qingzi told it to remain a good distance away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Receiving Ye Qingzi’s command, Water Moon’s body slowly lit with a beautiful glow. This glow that could strengthen Mo Xie slowly arose, as if refracted by water, beautiful and multi-faceted…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finishing the change from the sixth phase to seventh stage, Mo Xie’s sharp claws reached the pseudo eighth rank. In addition, when the water moonlight, which was even more powerful than natural moonlight, fell upon Mo Xie, her cold Inferno Fox claws extended even further, glinting a metallic blue as well as the complexion of a moon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighth rank initial stage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Water Moon’s illumination, Mo Xie’s claws reached a stunning eighth rank realm. The two colored flames glowed with a noble silver, completely displaying the superior blood of this mutated fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Gluttonous Insect Monster’s defense wasn’t that high. Reaching eighth rank initial stage, with the help of techniques, Mo Xie could now break through the Gluttonous Insect Monster’s defense!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arrogant, noble, cold, demonic, at this moment, the Inferno Fox monarch’s aura was unbridled. Its rampant wild aura rolled straight towards the ninth phase Gluttonous Insect Monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seventh phase sixth stage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the water moon’s glow, Mo Xie’s stage raised six stages. Adding on the Water Moon’s water screen battle armor, Mo Xie could now fight the Gluttonous Insect Monster!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwuwu~~~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A battle of speed against speed, when Mo Xie stepped forward, she only left a fiery shadow in her place before disappearing completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Gluttonous Insect Monster wasn’t slow either. When Mo Xie flashed towards it, it wriggled its body and, changing its position five times a second, it made extreme movements that caused Mo Xie to be unable to find it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s silver demon pupils constantly observed the changing space. Without Chu Mu’s soul remembrance lock, Mo Xie could only rely on her own senses to determine the soul pet’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This street was very long, but all of it was already ruined. At this moment, one could clearly see small whirlwinds appear and quickly disappear after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These small whirlwinds were precisely the turning points of Mo Xie and the Gluttonous Insect Monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie had a period of time where her speed was explosive. With plenty of fighting experience, she knew that she must give the Gluttonous Insect Monster a heavy wound during this period, or else, once she slowed down, she wouldn’t have a chance against it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phantom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Gluttonous Insect Monster’s claws flashed past Mo Xie’s five shadows, so sharp they could directly snap a building in half. However, it only left a shallow mark on Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s five shadows didn’t immediately disappear. The five phantoms all became real inferno foxes, appearing in five locations around the Gluttonous Insect Monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Mo Xie didn’t use the Royal Flame Claw that was usually combined with phantom. The five phantoms almost simultaneously whipped out their nine powerful long fox tails!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five phantoms, each with nine tails, meaning there were a total of fourty five Inferno Fox tails!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The forty five inferno fox tails almost took up the entire space. Stuck in the gap between attacks, no matter how good at dodging the Gluttonous Insect Monster was, it couldn’t avoid forty five Inferno Fox Tails!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless inferno fox tails completely morphed into hard, silver chains. Just as the Gluttonous Insect Monster was chained down, the five Inferno Fox phantoms spread apart, causing the forty five silver glowing tails to go taut. As the phantoms continued to run further, the tails actually started snapping one by one!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!! Beng!! Beng!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every silver tail let out a crisp snap. This wasn’t the sound of Mo Xie’s tails snapping, however. The five images were all just phantoms of Mo Xie. The sound of bones breaking was because of the snapping bones of the Gluttonous Insect Monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eighth…...eighth rank soul technique……” Seeing this dominating, cold, yet grand technique cast, Duan Xinhe’s eyes opened wide in complete disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seventh rank soul techniques were already limited to only monarch ranks. The Gluttonous Insect Monsters Duan Xinhe gained from the commander rank Hundred Mother’s reproduction may be powerful, but none had ever learned a seventh rank technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Duan Xinhe had now witnessed a Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox learn an eighth rank technique. This technique was even casted on his own Gluttonous Insect Monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An eighth rank technique’s power was over five times that of a seventh rank technique. Mo Xie’s evil fox diagram forcefully ripped the Gluttonous Insect Monster’s bones apart. If not for the high stage and rank of the Gluttonous Insect Monster, this technique alone could’ve killed it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eighth rank soul technique…… Mo Xie’s talent truly is abnormal……” With a distant pupil, Ye Qingzi muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After casting the strange spell from before, Ye Qingzi’s entire body felt like it was shrouded in a strange shadow of death, just like the War Court Black Beast that leaped to eighth stage…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighth phase high stage, the War Court Black Beast’s fighting strength itself wasn’t weaker than Mo Xie, completely able to fight against same rank monarchs. Against the ninth phase Hundred Mother, this War Court Black Beast actually erupted with an unthinkable fighting intent. This wildness was even more complete than Mo Xie in moonlight. If Chu Mu could see this, he definitely wouldn’t believe that Ye Qingzi held such a powerful soul technique that could raise a soul pet by more than a full phase!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Violent Blood Pupil Chu Mu originally had was a spirit teacher soul technique. Such a technique, once trained to advance, could cause the soul pet to raise a phase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this increase was only for commanders under sixth phase. After all, after reaching seventh phase and monarch ranks, the strength difference was huge, so a spirit teacher soul technique couldn’t bring about such effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Qingzi’s War Court Black Beast already reached monarch rank. Its stage and phase also entered seventh phase. Under such circumstances, Ye Qingzi caused it to jump to eighth phase high stages. Such a leap would require tremendous power to sustain. If this soul technique were discovered, possibly any soul pet trainer would go crazy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe originally didn’t mind this girl’s technique, but as the War Court Black Beast fought with his Hundred Mother, Duan Xinhe was shocked to discover that the unnoticeable War Court Black Beast could actually fight with his Hundred Mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not knowing life and death, with just you two garbages, you want to fight me, &nbsp;Duan Xinhe? Don’t even dare, don’t even dare!!” Duan Xinhe said angrily. He no longer cared about his dwindling soul power, choosing to chant an incantation firmly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Budding Split!!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation quickly finished. Duan Xinhe was covered in a blood colored glow. As this glow became brighter and brighter, Duan Xinhe’s entire body looked as if it were dunked in blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something even more frightening happened. Duan Xinhe, covered in blood, suddenly started growing tumors. These tumors fell along with the blood glow on Duan Xinhe, collecting on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this scene, Ye Qingzi sucked in a breath. At this moment, Duan Xinhe seemed to be pulling flesh off himself to mold into a soul pet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Xinhe’s Budding Split was using his own flesh and blood to create attached pets. This meant that Duan Xinhe himself had also become a monster that could reproduce soul pets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Budding Split, using one’s own blood, body, and life as price to create a attached pet to one’s mother soul pet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very quickly, the bloody pieces that fell from Duan Xinhe was molded into a seemingly skinless Gluttonous Insect Monster. Its appearance was terrifying, possibly causing any normal person to vomit at sight!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die, all of you!!” Duan Xinhe directly gave the Gluttonous Insect Monster a command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Gluttonous Insect Monster’s speed was even faster than the ninth phase Gluttonous Insect Monster. When it stepped forward, it became a scary blood beam that charged directly towards the eighth phase high stage War Court Black Beast!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The War Court Black Beast was fighting with the Hundred Mother when, in a moment of carelessness, it was slammed aside by the disgusting thing. It flew a dozen meters away. If not for the Water Moon’s timely protection, it may have been flung even further, suffering worse wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ting!” Seeing the War Court Black Beast hurt, Ye Qingzi’s heart was burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi had already used all her power to increase the War Court Black Beast’s power, but even then, to fight Duan Xinhe, a notorious soul pet trainer within the world, was a stretch. Seeing that Duan Xinhe had now summoned an even more powerful soul pet, Ye Qingzi no longer knew what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwuwu~~~~~~~~wuwuwuwu~~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that Ye Qingzi fell in danger, Mo Xie grew worried. Heavily flicking the ninth phase Gluttonous Insect Monster away, its demon eyes glanced at the tall ruins that covered Chu Mu and let out a few emergency cries!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwuwu~~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu was connected by heart to Mo Xie. Even in an uncontrollable state, Chu Mu could hear the calls for help from Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu also knew the basic situation outside, so he was similarly impatient, wanting to immediately kill his way out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The energy injection of the Jade Spring was slowly weakening, and Chu Mu could feel every inch of himself filled with power. Once the baptism of the Jade Spring ended, this energy would erupt fully!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s almost over, it’s almost over, just a little longer!” Chu Mu shouted in his heart, his white demonic devil fire covered face already showing signs of mania .</span></p>
