 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first day of the conference began and the representatives of the factions sat in the main peak villa.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two royal families were not pretentious and the factions sat according to their strength rank as recognized in the human realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The independent territories were put together in the same area. The first seat belonged to Beiming City’s City Lord Xia Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Xia Yin was Li Xian, who represented Wo City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under that were the representatives from Wupan Continent’s independent territories. Only at the seventh seat was New Moon Land’s spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were about 200 people in the villa hall. Each one of them represented a faction or was specially invited by the two royal families.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not many people from the royal families appeared. Only the hosts of the conference came.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the hosts and their servants had everyone go to their seats, the family masters of the six royal families finally appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six royal family masters were all sat in the main seats and they looked down at the rest of the audience like monarchs looking at their subjects. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu glanced over the six royal family masters. The only woman among them was Family Master Rong. The others all looked middle-aged or slightly older than middle-aged. He wasn’t able to determine how old they were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Family Master Rong was situated on the left most seat. Her clothing was the exact opposite of when Bai Yu had seen her last time. She wore a tight white gown over her slender and tall figure. A silk black belt wrapped around her slim and petite waist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her hair was combed into a tall bun while her eyebrows and eyes were dressed up with light makeup. She covered a few of her wrinkles she shouldn’t have very well. If one were not carefully looking, he or she may even feel she was a thirty year old beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first time Bai Yu saw her was when she was standing on the arch bridge, looking down on him. However, Bai Yu had still thought her temperament was noble and aloof.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now appearing in front of 200 of humanity’s most powerful administrators, and even sitting in the master’s seat, the heroism and dignity she displayed were even further accentuated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu was curious as to how much power a woman like this controlled and what kind of unparalleled strength she had. Otherwise, how else would she be able to look down on all of the leaders, gate masters, border lords and kings present in the great hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the right of Family Master Rong was a black-haired man with white streaks of hair on either side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lines on this family master’s face were imposing and stalwart. He looked like a stern young man. However, the two streaks of white hair indicated that his age was quite high. The reason why he still maintained a youthful face was because he had obtained a very high cultivation when he was very young.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The family master with the white streaks had chaotic eyes. His purple pupils showed no emotions. However, when his eyes would inadvertently shoot towards the independent territory seats, his eyes would show something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is probably the strongest family master among Hidden Pupil Royalty,” thought Bai Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An expert had his own aura. When Bai Yu looked at this family master with the white streaks, he felt a deeply immeasurable aura. He emitted a feeling of extreme danger, one that Bai Yu didn’t feel from Family Master Rong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the right of this family master was an old man. There were many wrinkles on his face and it looked like he had reached the end of his years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu also quickly examined Wupan Royal Family’s three family masters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wupan Royalty was slightly different from Hidden Pupil Royalty because to a certain extent, the former controlled the Ning Family Dynasty. Therefore, there was bound to be a Ning surnamed family master among these three Wupan Royalty family masters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ning Family Dynasty also had representatives in the audience. Bai Yu didn’t have much of an understanding of the Ning Family Dynasty’s circumstances. He only knew that the person sitting in the guest seat was probably the Ning Family Dynasty's king because when he had sat down himself, he had heard someone call that man King Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">King Ning was dressed very normally and his looks were very average. If it weren’t for the aura of an expert lingering around him, it was unlikely anyone would think this somewhat slovenly dressed man was the king of one of humanity’s two great dynasties, the Ning Family Dynasty!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">King Ning didn’t seem very interested in this conference. Right under the eyes of the six royal family masters, he was chatting away with some female Gate Master behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost everyone in the conference was sat upright and seemed reserved, serious, and earnest. There were even a few first-time participants of humanity’s highest conference that were a bit nervous. Only King Ning seemed somewhat out of place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, King Ning had the qualifications to be this way because he was a genuine human king. If it were anyone else that acted so casual, they probably would have already been thrown out by the strong royalty enforcers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone here had high status. But even with high status, in the eyes of the royal families, these people were negligible!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mu Family Dynasty’s King Mu seemed rather calm. He had a tall and mighty figure and when he sat, he was much taller than everyone else. Nonetheless, he still exuded the demeanor of a king. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two kings were the highest status people in humanity. Sitting at the same level as these two kings were also Divine Sect’s Xiao Xueang, Xuan Gate Immortal Sect’s old sect master, Elemental Sect’s vice sect master, Peng Meng, Demon Beast Palace’s highest enforcer, Yin Ce, Departed Spirit Palace’s Corpse King, Hu Ming and Wupan Navy’s Chief Commander, Nan Xiao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were all leader rank humans. Although not all of the leader rank humans were gathered here, these people already had absolute representative power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind these seats were the gate masters, sect gate masters, faction lords, enforcers and eminences of the My Family Dynasty, the Ning Family Dynasty, Divine Sect, Xuan Gate Immortal Sect, Demon Beast Palace, Elemental Sect, Departed Spirit Palace, Wupan Navy and other powerful factions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chu Mu were here, he would definitely recognize a few faces. There was Madam Huo who wanted to steal the Seven Sins Fox Light King’s Monument Tear, Snake Dragon Faction’s Eminence Zeng Long, and Divine Sect Sect Master Du’s capable subordinate, Qin Guang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were about sixty or seventy of these people and they occupied a rather large portion of the mountain villa great hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After them, there were about forty or fifty Border Lords from the various large Border Kingdoms. Among them, a few high ranking border lords from eighth rank border kingdoms and above sat right behind the leader rank seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps these high ranking Border Lords weren’t much lower than the leaders, but in terms of real status, they were still inferior to these leaders that controlled enormous factions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Independent territories, prestigious families, independents sect, and factions occupied the seats near the back. There were also a few soul pet trainers specially invited. These people were placed together and it felt like they formed a faction themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu’s seat was also amongst these eccentric fellows. He had heard of a few of them before. They were wandering soul pet trainers with strength very close to the leader ranks, but preferred to stay independent. Unfortunately, Bai Yu only recognized a few and he couldn’t be bothered to say hello to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truthfully, this group of people was very respected by the large factions because every faction was trying very hard to rope them in. The people that were able to stand out amongst the billions of others without relying on the enormous resources of factions were true experts! If the feeling was right, there were probably a few Monument Tear Individuals among them!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for whether they possessed their own Monument Tears or someone else’s Monument Tears, only they knew themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, there are a few new faces. It seems that a group of newbies have entered our line of sight.” Wupan Royalty’s Family Master Ning said the first thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are many young faces as well. These twenty years can be considered as the emergence of talent, eh. This old man here has held this conference ten times. I’ve seen generation after generation of human experts continuously replace each other. It probably won’t even be long before I am replaced by someone new.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu looked at Family Master Ning, who was in charge of speaking, and he was somewhat shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was the tenth time he hosted this conference, this meant that Family Master Ning 200 years ago was already a leading figure of the royal family!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter how strong someone is, he is unable to contend against time. Generations will be replaced, as will experts. This is a normal occurrence. Therefore, you shouldn’t feel sorrowful over my gradual deterioration. Instead, you should feel gratification for the new generation of experts that have emerged.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should only sigh so much. Regardless if you are an old face or a new face, the fact you are able to sit here means that you are the most outstanding people among billions and billions of humans.The living creatures in our world are split into plant types, demon beast types, elemental types, and departed spirit types. Then, today’s main topic will be about the fifth type of living species in this world - humans.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment these words were said, the members’ that were participating in this conference for the first time revealed surprised expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main topic of the conference would be “humans”?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But why were humans called the fifth great type?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The new faces probably still haven’t realized exactly what kind of existence us humans are in this world. That’s not strange at all because you live in the human domain and all you will ever see here is the human species. You have never stepped out of this range and seen the entire human species.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And now, I will tell you newcomers the truth: the human species is only one of the world’s great species!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words immediately caused an uproar in the conference!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans were only one of the great species in this world?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did this mean that aside from humans, there were also other super species that had a civilization like humans?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how could that be possible? Soul pets were clearly no more different from a pack of wild beasts. Even if they formed tribes, empires and dynasties, they would ultimately be nothing more than group of monsters with no civilization to speak of. How could they have families, social groups, cities, roads, languages, intelligence and consciousness that was comparable to humans?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wupan Royalty Family Master Ning’s opening words gave Liu Binglan great shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was obviously one of the new faces Family Master Ning had referred to. She had also never heard of anything about other great species’ civilizations. To the best of her knowledge, humans should be the only rulers in this world. However, Family Master Ning’s words had instantly overturned this deeply-rooted notion in her as well as practically everyone else!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were other great species with their own prosperous civilizations?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But then why had they never seen it before??&nbsp;</span></p>
