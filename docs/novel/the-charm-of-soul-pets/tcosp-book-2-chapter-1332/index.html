 <p>Left hand wielding flames, right hand with silver devil flames. Chu Mu held the two globs of flames and threw them above everyone!!</p>
 <p>Black and silver interlaced into an evil devil flame diagram, splitting the black and white perfectly!</p>
 <p>The black and white flames were lifted up and got larger and larger, to the point where the entire sky was covered!</p>
 <p>Eight Divination Diagram! It burned with flames, creating ancient massive dragons and phoenixes dancing through the sky!</p>
 <p>As if ripping through the sky, suddenly a black meteor ripped through the skies, bringing along a long tail that slammed into the earth!!</p>
 <p>“Hong!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The black meteor pierced through, creating a terrifying death cloud inside the hundred dominator rank experts!</p>
 <p>Within the fire cloud range, the closest ten spirit palace members were riding their soul pets as they escaped for their lives out of this fire cloud.</p>
 <p>However, under such destruction, their defense techniques were useless. Running away was similarly meaningless.</p>
 <p>In the flame clouds, rolling over the ten soul pet trainers that had nowhere to go.</p>
 <p>As long as they were touched by a spark, they were incinerated. None of the ten soul pet trainers were spared; the fire cloud devoured them all, and incinerated all their body and soul!!</p>
 <p>These ten soul pet trainers were all high class dominator rank now. Two of the soul pet trainers were even top tier dominator rank.</p>
 <p>However, after the black death meteors fell, none of them survived!</p>
 <p>Using their entire life to reach such a level, they still couldn’t do anything against such powerful strength. They couldn’t escape the reality of being instantly killed. When they cruelly and ruthlessly killed all the quiet forest wind eagles, had they ever thought that they would be slaughtered just like pigs or sheep as well!?!</p>
 <p>The ten spirit dominator ranks instantly getting killed caused the remaining alive members to be scared stiff. They originally thought that standing by immortal rank experts, they had more chances of staying alive. However, the six immortal rank soul pets didn’t dare to stop the black meteor crash!</p>
 <p>“Huhuhu~~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the piercing shriek through the air caused everyone to be shocked; the white black devil man’s technique hadn’t finished yet!</p>
 <p>The black meteor was just the beginning of the eight divination meteor fire. The dragons and phoenixes summoned more meteors from the far skies down to earth, creating long and brilliant tails of flames that slammed into the ground!!</p>
 <p>Black meteors, white meteors- all types of different flames fell from the skies, creating a thick scent of incineration and destruction!</p>
 <p>A single meteor was enough to instantly kill ten spirit dominator rank experts. With this many meteors, how many would survive?</p>
 <p>The spirit dominator rank experts lifted their heads and were full of desperation. There was no point in escaping now!</p>
 <p>“Honghonghong!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The world-destroying meteors blew up in the quiet forest, each slamming into the ground and creating a quake through the earth!</p>
 <p>Space shattering power, black white devil flames’ burning- under this powerful technique, all lifeforms under immortal rank were instantly vaporized!!!</p>
 <p>Under the Messiah Tree, Ning Maner who was spared from any of the flames widened her eyes. She stared in disbelief as these intruders she resented so much became ashes under the flames!</p>
 <p>Evil men didn’t need sympathy. Ning Maner wouldn’t sympathize with these dying intruders. However, the utmost evil energy Chu Mu held caused her heart to shiver!</p>
 <p>Such an attack, if not for Chu Mu’s careful control, could cause countless lives in Quiet Forest to die. It was truly a calamity of the forest!</p>
 <p>Ning Maner’s slowly clearing eyes gazed at Chu Mu. She could feel the anger and resentment in Chu Mu’s heart, but there was also a sliver of indecipherable sadness in his heart.</p>
 <p>With such strong strength, why was Chu Mu sad? Ning Maner couldn’t understand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>The air they breathed was full of devil flames both burning and yet cold. The black and white split devil man Chu Mu floated down to the Messiah Tree, his evil pupils cold but proud.</p>
 <p>He gazed down at the soul pets incinerated by the eight divination meteor flames and silently watched as they disappeared under the black and silver flames.</p>
 <p>Just not long ago, his own strength was only slightly stronger than these spirit dominators.</p>
 <p>Yet now, a casual technique was enough to wipe out hundreds of them!</p>
 <p>This was power, power that anyone yearned for! Power to no longer be bullied, the power to control the lives of others!</p>
 <p>If it were any other time, Chu Mu would go crazy over gaining such power. Yet, only at this particular time, did Chu Mu’s heart feel unprecedentedly heavy, so heavy that every breath he took pained his heart.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu slowly turned around to look at the black flames burning on his left side.</p>
 <p>No matter how powerful the strength he controlled, Chu Mu won’t ever forget the scene he had just seen, the one where White Three kneeled down before him and begged to be devoured.</p>
 <p>It lowered its head and used the last bit of its life to become black flames. Even though Chu Mu didn’t see its eyes, in that moment, he knew it was full of yearning for life.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu would forever remember that he devoured a Nightmare’s soul worth respecting to receive this power that looked down upon all dominator ranks!</p>
 <p>The black devil flames were created with White Three’s dying wish. It burned wildly- yearning to battle, yearning to burn everyone that hurt Ning Maner into ashes!!</p>
 <p>Since it yearned so much, then Chu Mu would grant its wish. The dominator rank intruders were only the appetizer of this battle. The real evil, the ones that truly hurt Ning Maner’s heart, were these six immortal rank experts and the human leaders behind each of them!!</p>
 <p>“It’s your turn!” Chu Mu looked down on the six immortal rank experts representing separate factions of Wupan Continent, and coldly announced their deaths!</p>
 <p>Killing a hundred dominator rank experts with one technique was something Xu Lu and the other five never expected!</p>
 <p>This black and white devil man’s strength was far from just strong!</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>“Shen Nine Ghosts, prepare your Five Ghost Diagram!” Divine Sect Xu Lu glanced at Shen Nine Ghosts and said solemnly.</p>
 <p>Shen Nine Ghosts’ Ghost Blood Diagram was an extremely famous sealing diagram in Wupan continent. If it could successfully seal the black and white devil man and absorb its life force, they would have a chance to fight this devil man in this battle!!</p>
 <p>“We’d have to withstand the brunt of its assault first!” Shen Nine Ghost said sullenly.</p>
 <p>Kang Ruodong was the earliest to arrive there, and his Poison Tooth beast had been fighting for a long while. If Xu Lu suddenly assaulted him, he could also instantly kill Kang Ruodong’s wounded Poison Tooth Beast.</p>
 <p>However, no matter how powerful Xu Lu was, he couldn’t instantly kill over a hundred dominator rank experts with one technique. These “cannon fodder” from each faction indeed did their job, and at least let the six immortal rank experts know that the black and &nbsp;white devil man was far stronger than they imagined!</p>
 <p>However, to test the black and white devil man’s strength, they lost way too much!!</p>
 <p>“Everyone’s in the same boat now. If no one wants to end up like Kang Ruodong with his heart gouged out, let’s gather our power and give Shen Nine Ghosts a chance to cast the Ghost Blood Diagram. If anyone tries to play dirty here, heng, then we’ll all die here anyway.” The strongest Divine Sect Xu Lu said with his mental remembrance.</p>
 <p>Xu Lu’s brother Xu Kuan was the first to nod, with Demon Beast Palace Huo Lei agreeing after. The remaining Navy General Xue Yingfeng, Elemental Sect Guo Yinglong, and Departed Spirit Palace Shen Bu all didn’t hesitate for long either and agreed!</p>
 <p>Since Xu Lu was the one to bring it up, he naturally had to be the man to go directly against the black and white devil man. Let alone, the only one suited to battle the black and white devil man head-on was probably his light type Light Emperor!</p>
 <p>The Light Emperor was a top tier species of light type soul pets, the exact opposite of He Cang’s Dark Emperor. Because of their soul pets’ opposition, it caused Xu Lu and He Cang to have a grudge against each other too.</p>
 <p>Both of them were formless balls of energy, able to change into any shape based on their intentions.</p>
 <p>The golden Light Emperor first morphed into a light type beast, its body noble and imposing- enough to shatter everything!</p>
 <p>The beast form Light Emperor didn’t directly attack, but instead stood in front of the six immortal rank experts, waiting for the attack from the black and white devil man!</p>
 <p>Xu Lu’s nerves were taut. The process of the black and white devil man killing Kang Ruodong was something he had seen. This black and white devil man also controlled utmost power in Other type, with its body easily able to pass through different dimensions and appear wherever it wanted. Such an unpredictable organism was the hardest to deal with. If they weren’t alert, they wouldn’t even know how they died.</p>
 <p>Behind Xu Lu was Xu Kuan and his Light’s Fury.</p>
 <p>Light’s Fury’s strength was clearly weaker than the Light’s Emperor, and it was also wounded by White Three in the previous battle. It would be a surprise if it could even use 60% of its normal power.</p>
 <p>“Light’s Eye!” Xu Kuan commanded his Light’s Fury to cast Light’s Eye.</p>
 <p>Once the Light’s Eye mark lands on someone, no matter how well it could hide, the Light’s Fury coulddetect where it is. Facing a dark and other type organism like the black and white devil man, this Light’s Eye was very important.</p>
 <p>The incantation finished and a holy light fell from the sky, accurately marking Chu Mu.</p>
 <p>The light’s eye formed, creating an eyeball like glow above Chu Mu’s head, its white energy lighting up the evil Chu Mu.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu remained floating there, completely ignoring the Light’s Fury technique, not even glancing at the mark.</p>
 <p>His pupils remained fixed on the six people, the burning fighting intent in his bones reaching a peak!</p>
 <p>He wanted to bring White Three’s yearning and fight to the extreme, until they were crazy!!</p>
