 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue ocean was beneath them. It was calm without any ripples and reflected the white clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu flew flew past the ocean and blue sky in between shadow cloud and sky cloud. He was gradually approaching Demonic Mound according to the direction Old Li pointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demonic Mound was within Eternal Ocean, but its location was not fixed. Without a professional guide, it would be difficult to find it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li came from Demonic Mound, so it naturally knew the way back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Chu Mu’s current strength, his flying speed was much faster than when he was still a Dominator. It took only about ten days for him to fly a distance that took several months on ship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mysterious Demonic Mound was right in front. Chu Mu could see some purplish Immortal mist gathering into a cloud and covering a certain spot within the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After flying into this cluster of purlish cloud, Chu Mu saw the Demonic Mound island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flight was prohibited on the island. This prohibition naturally held limitations. Chu Mu was currently clad in dual evil Devil Fire. His majestic Immortal rank aura was enough to make those wing type creatures in Demonic Mound avoid him. He would not be obstructed even if he flew into Demonic Mound directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, the Immortal aura here is so dense,” said Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner liked the atmosphere around here. It gave her a feeling that she returned to the Quiet Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the cruelty and competition hidden in this Demonic Mound was not something she liked. She liked peaceful places without any conflicts or fights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? So many powerful demons,” Ning Maner looked over the island and saw many high rank demons strolling all over the island. Emperors were mainly on the outskirts of the island, while Dominator rank creatures could be seen everywhere slightly inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They did not even enter halfway into the island and yet high rank creatures were everywhere. Then, just how powerful would the creatures be further inside?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second Demonic Mound precipice was right ahead. This precipice that towered into the clouds exuded a magnificent aura. They had to raise their heads to barely see the summit even in flight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demonic Mound precipice was perpendicular to the ground. Its altitude was extremely high. The summit was unlike normal mountain summits, it was a flat ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not need to take the Yellow Spring Road this time. He carried Ning Maner and flew up this second precipice directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were countless caves on the perpendicular precipice, becoming cliff nests. Demonic Mound guardians lived on those cliff nests in groups. He could not even count how many there were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Green vines hung down and bizarre pine trees grew along the precipice wall. Lichen crawled all over the surface. Other than wing type creatures within the caves, vine type, wood type and grass type were also living on this precipice. It was difficult to imagine how such a precipice could create such a densely packed and complete ecological chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second Demonic Mound precipice was really high. Chu Mu realized there was still a long way to go after flying through the cloud layer. With this height, Chu Mu even suspected this might ascend directly into the second layer of the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also Ning Maner’s ssdn time to see such a magnificent precipice. Her beautiful eyes sparkled and seemed extremely excited. She was really looking forward to seeing how the summit of this precipice was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, Chu Mu saw the summit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The summit was a large piece of land. One could only see the blue sky while standing on it, no clouds or rain, because rain clouds were beneath this Heavenly Realm land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, look, it’s a Sky Swallowing Roc, it’s so big!” Ning Maner excitedly pointed at a huge grey-colored roc far away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When that Sky Swallowing Roc flew over the land. Its enormous body was able to cover the sky. This should be the largest wing type creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sky Swallowing Roc’s shadow casted down on the land and covered a large piece of Heavenly Realm in shadow. It casually flapped its wings and seemed to notice an intruder to this Heavenly Realm. It turned its direction and flew towards Chu Mu slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a light flap of its wings, the entire sky was filled with billowing wind. Sky Swallowing Roc approached Chu Mu. Chu Mu and Ning Maner were even smaller than a feather on its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi~!” Sky Swallowing Roc focused on Chu Mu and Ning Maner. It let out a chirp which sounded like an interrogation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, it’s asking who we are and what we are doing here. It seems to be the aerial guardian of this Heavenly Realm,” Ning Maner could understand the language of all soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell it that we are here to look for Elder Li,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner conveyed Chu Mu’s words to Sky Swallowing Roc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, it’s telling us to follow it,” said Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sky Swallowing Roc flew at the front. It was enormous and would not mind about Chu Mu and Ning Maner as they were not even as big as its feathers, but that did not mean it was willing to let Chu Mu and Ning Maner ride on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sky Swallowing Roc did not fly at full speed. Its wing flapping frequency was not fast, so it was easy for Chu Mu to follow it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the flight, Chu Mu saw various powerful creatures in this Demonic Mound Heavenly Realm. They were similar to the other regions of Demonic Mound and possessed their own territories. Apart from guardians like Sky Swallowing Roc which could fly freely above their territories, they would surely become hostile if other creatures did that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Chu Mu had been suspecting whether all the creatures in Demonic Mound Heavenly Realm were Immortal rank creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he flew and observed, the truth told him that his suspicion was correct. It was already astonishing that the average strength of creatures in the Imprint Valley was at Dominator rank. The average strength of creatures in Demonic Mound Heavenly Realm was actually at Immortal rank, this astonished Chu Mu even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just how powerful is the ruler of this Demonic Mound Heavenly Realm?” Chu Mu could not help but started to guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A creature that could rule over an Immortal region, it definitely had to possess the absolute strength that could look down over all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they entered deeper, stronger Immortal rank creatures also started appearing. There were even one or two on par with Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for personally witnessing them, Chu Mu could hardly believe Immortal rank creatures which required vast resources as cultivation support could inhabit together on a piece of land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tall foreign rock suddenly appeared on the flat ground. This foreign rock seemed to have fallen down from the starry sky into the mortal world. It made a huge crater on the Heavenly Realm’s land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a deep gully in the North of this crater. The gully was filled up by various plants. Even the area around the foreign rock became different ecologies. If not for witnessing these traces from the sky, Chu Mu would not be able to tell how this foreign rock suddenly appeared on the flat Heavenly Realm land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that this foreign rock should be from the scene he saw in the Heaven Boundary Monument. What he had to find was also beneath this foreign rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sky Swallowing Roc did not bring Chu Mu and Ning Maner to that rock, but turned to a forest on the side instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towering trees grew densely in the forest. The flourishing canopies became platforms of various shades of green. They could occasionally see some agile creatures jumping around these canopies and drawing beautiful curves in the air. When he wanted to look closer, he would lose sight of those agile creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi~!” Sky Swallowing Roc chirped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, it’s telling us to go down ourselves. Someone will bring us to Elder Li,” said Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded and carried Ning Maner as he flew towards this unique forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu landed on a canopy. The canopy was dense and he had no problem walking above it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Chu Mu saw those agile creatures jumping towards him. They stood on the canopies of other trees and used their curious eyes to examine Chu Mu and Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are Canopy Demons, they look so cute,” A smile bloomed on Ning Maner’s face. She got out of Chu Mu’s hug and ran towards the three Canopy Demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those Canopy Demons maintained caution towards the two humans at first. However, for some reason, after Ning Maner ran over and stroked the furry ears and heads of those Canopy Demons, they seemed to rather enjoy it and intimately licked Ning Maner’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was similarly maintaining caution as those three Canopy Demons were powerful. If they attacked him simultaneously, he would have some trouble handling it. He never expected Ning Maner to easily tame those three Canopy Demons after just a little interaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that even Immortal rank creatures could not resist Ning Maner’s unique affinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother, they said they are willing to carry us,” said Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saying so, Ning Maner already rode on the back of a Canopy Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will fly by myself,” Chu Mu could feel that those Canopy Demons only became intimate with Ning Maner, but not him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then big brother has to catch up, they are really fast!” said Ning Maner with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, I won’t lose them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Chu Mu finished speaking, the three Canopy Demons became a gust of wind and disappeared with Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was startled for a moment and did not expect those Canopy Demons to be so fast. He took a glance at the ripples on the canopy platforms and confirmed their direction. Then, he immediately used Displacement Specter to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After chasing for a while, he could hear the cheerful laughter from Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pleasing laughter spread out in the forest and could easily make one forget all troubles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those creatures living in the forest also raised their heads to see which little fairy was visiting the forest......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching the fluttering curly hair and laughing Ning Maner in front, Chu Mu felt gratified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that this Demonic Mound Heavenly Realm was the only place that was similar to Quiet Forest. Ning Maner could find that purest liberation in this place. So her laughter was also very pure and came from her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was pure and happy, a fairy that danced with nature. The places her laughter spread to would calm the living beings and shower them with the raindrops of peace......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wind Eagle clan’s protection was worth it. He Cang’s sacrifice was also worth it. As long as anyone held conscience, they would not want to see such a girl getting hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was the purest favored child of nature.</span></p>
