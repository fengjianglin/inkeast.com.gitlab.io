 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn’t Ning Maner say her power came from the Messiah Tree?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did the thing Xiao Xiao was investigating have to do with the Messiah Tree and Ning Maner?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Sun quickly realized there were other people present. He had indeed just gotten angry because of Xiao Xiao’s recklessness. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have so carelessly spoken about this matter to outsiders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu wanted to inquire further, but when he saw Xuan Teacher Sun had already stopped this topic, Chu Mu knew there was no way of doing so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Xiao Xiao looked like she knew she did something wrong, her eyes betrayed her original intentions; she would investigate this matter to the end! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t the few of you drink some alcohol and rest here. The xuan items you want will take some time.” Xuan Teacher Sun politely said to the four of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve inconvenienced by Xuan Teacher Sun.” responded Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Sun faintly smiled. He stood up from his chair and left the servant here to attend these people while he walked towards shi medicine yard. He was probably going to personally concoct xuan items for Chu Mu and the others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The xuan item Chu Mu requested for was of the ninth rank. A ninth rank xuan item concoction couldn’t be easily completed. Even Xuan Teacher Sun had to be particularly careful</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Xuan Teacher Sun left, Chu Mu immediately asked Xiao Xiao: “Xiao Xiao, who are are you investigating?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A few thugs dressed up in the attire of big factions. This matter began many years ago in an extremely horrible event…” XIao Xiao didn’t evade the topic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me about it. This matter could likely have something to do with a girl I know.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao nodded her head: “Do you know of Quiet Forest?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, Chao Lengchuan, Ye Wansheng, and Pang Yue all shook their heads. This was the first time they had entered Wupan territory. They didn’t know of many places.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Xiao Xiao was instantly speechless. These four didn’t even know of Wupan territory’s famous forbidden forest. How were they all spirit dominator experts?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We come from Zhengming territory’s New Moon Land. We don’t know much about your Wupan territory.” explained Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, so you’re Zhengming territory people.” Xiao Xiao instantly understood and she explained, “Quiet Forest is an extremely famous forbidden forest in our Wupan territory. It’s like Wupan City which is the birthplace of us humans. Legends of Quiet Forest have it that many primogenitor rank species were born here. This forbidden forest has always precluded us humans from entering. For one reason, Quiet Forest has various legendary creatures and in the eyes of our ancestors, it was an unblasphemable holy land. For another reason, Quiet Forest is home to many powerful creatures.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao lifted her head and Old Li scuttled out and began to supplement Xiao Xiao’s words: “So it’s Blasphemy Forest. The name you humans give it is different from us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You also know of the event in Quiet Forest?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, the moment she described it, I knew which forbidden forest she was speaking of.” Old Li nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao had seen Chu Mu’s talking raccoon yesterday. Thus, she just watched it to see what it would say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Quiet Forest you speak of is actually the birthplace of the wood type primogenitor: the Messiah Tree. The Messiah Tree probably has the longest history of and is the strongest wood type creature. &nbsp;Essentially, among the thousands upon ten thousands of wood type species you humans have recorded, at least half of them are direct or relative descendents of the Messiah Tree. The Messiah Tree’s history among wood types is of the same level as the flower type progenitor - the Evil Good Demon Concubine Flower.” said Old Li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng, Chao Lengchuan, and Pang Yue all quickly looked at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t the demonically beautiful woman Chu Mu had subdued the Evil Good Queen?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they knew of this, they didn’t realize the Evil Good Queen was the flower type progenitor. It was no wonder this woman had such terrifying fighting strength even before reaching the tenth phase!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked at the three people staring at him. Thus, he added: “Primogenitor doesn’t mean it’s the strongest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. Primogenitor doesn’t mean it’s the strongest. They are undoubtedly strong, but evolution over countless years will ultimately make a few descendants surpass the primogenitor. I can take responsibility and say that the reason primogenitor rank creatures are practically extinct is because they, to a certain extent, are non longer suited to surviving in this world.” said Old Li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Taking the Messiah Tree as an example, it has a fatal flaw: its own fighting strength is practically zero.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fighting strength is zero? It can’t be, right? Shouldn’t primogenitor rank creatures be able to destroy the heavens and earth?” asked Ye Wansheng with a flabbergasted expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li shook his finger and continued: “The Messiah Tree doesn’t have fighting strength. It’s the world’s tree. The energy it possesses comes from absorbing the sunlight, elements, turbid air and energy in the world. It transforms them into the spirit, xuan and immortal energy that other species rely on to survive and makes them stronger. It can be described as an offering tree.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In ancient times, there were not as many species as there are now. In the chaos, the Messiah Tree was like a godly tree that covered all of the land it could with its energy, nurturing millions and millions of life forms.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“During that era, the Messiah Tree was actually a god. There was no species that dared desecrate such a benevolent offering god. However, as more and more species evolved, more and more powerful creatures appeared. Thus, if for example the Messiah Tree had nurtured 100 species in the past, they would eventually expand into 1000 species. Then, the Messiah Tree’s nurturing energy would become one tenth of the past. This one tenth nurturing energy naturally wouldn’t be enough to satisfy species that were growing increasingly strong. Therefore, the reliance of these species on the Messiah Tree grew increasingly weak. Finally, they subdivided into even more branch lineages. Some of these branch lineages would be stronger while others would be weaker. If the stronger ones wouldn’t receive nurturing they would greedily occupy the Messiah Tree’s territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just like this, there will be greed, killing and plundering. In the past, ostensibly every tribe, empire and dynasty would receive nurturing from the Messiah Tree. But today the Messiah Tree is nearly extinct and cannot be found anywhere.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li spoke of a long time ago, but Chu Mu was able to imagine the gradual decline of the once god-tree Messiah Tree. Perhaps Old Li was right. Even strong creatures were unable to withstand the changes of time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps it was the kings of a few powerful species that realized the extinction of the Messiah Tree had something to do with their greed. Indeed, the Messiah Tree was, true to its name, an offering god. Thus, these kings of various species who felt ashamed inside made Quiet Forest, where the first Messiah Tree was born, a holy land that no species, including humans, would be easily able to blasphemy. Just like a great steel gate that stood there, it warned and prevented their own descendants from disturbing the final god tree.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once creatures grew strong, they would possess some form of intelligence. Humans were the highest embodiment of intelligent creatures, but this didn’t mean only humans had intelligence and civilization. There really was a chance the highest kings of the various great species came up with this agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, despite this agreement, it was unable to withstand the test of time. In the current era, many species that had slowly risen to power have forgotten the ancient teachings of their ancestors. For example, you humans. I’m certain that not many of the few supreme kings of your species actually care about this agreement.” Old Li carried a trace of mockery in his voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, Old Li threw a glance at Xiao Xiao and said: “You can tell us now what happened in Quiet Forest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao was a bit stunned from listening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li’s words seemed to be from an ancient legend. It seemed a bit esoteric.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if Old Li was speaking the truth, then the people who had ravaged Quiet Forest were historical criminals who had destroyed this final agreement. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao had originally believed these people had only done some morally degenerate things. She never expected this matter to actually involve such an ancient agreement!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I… I really didn’t know this much. I only knew that there was a group of human leaders that kept their identities hidden who entered Quiet Forest to steal a huge amount of resources…” Xiao Xiao was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao was not a particularly high ranking member of Demon Beast Palace. She was tasked with investigating the plundering event in Quiet Forest. When she had traced the matter to the two men from last night, she discovered that those two could likely be the subordinates of a senior who had participated in that event. She only wanted to follow the clues and uncover their identities. Then, she would hand the matter over to her teacher to complete.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The things you know are a lot. It’s not fitting for your identities.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a voice broke into the courtyard, causing the atmosphere of the courtyard to suddenly change.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Sun.” Xiao Xiao looked at Xuan Teacher Sun who had come back at some point and for a moment didn’t know what to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Teacher Sun helplessly shook his head and slowly walked back to his original spot. He stared curiously at Old Li who had just spoken of this ancient secret.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you pretty much know it all, I’ll tell you the rest. If I tell you, at least your curiosity will be quelled and you won’t provoke any disaster to yourselves. Young people are young people after all. You’re willing to ask about anything… truly headache-inducing.” Xuan Teacher Sun rubbed his temples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This matter involved Ning Maner’s experiences so Chu Mu obviously wanted to know everything. However, he could see that this matter seemed to implicate many large factions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just as that raccoon said, the highest kings of us humans never properly constrained their descendents. A few greedy humans invaded Quiet Forest and relied on their powerful strength to steal the last thing in Quiet Forest… The human leaders I’m speaking of aren’t Borders Commanders or Border Lords. Their current rank is something you guys are currently incapable of climbing up to. Otherwise, why else would Divine Sect not dare punish this matter?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These leaders are very strong and are ostensibly all people who are able to cover the two territories in this world with their hands. Even if Divine Sect is able to guess who the perpetrators are, in order to not incite a huge bloody storm in human territory… in fact, this is the only time Divine Sect has maintained silence in over a hundred years.”&nbsp;</span></p>
