 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The legion’s ships were bound to the canyon, and there were still a few navy members stationed on the boats. They were extremely bored as they cleaned the deck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’ve returned. They’ve returned!!” suddenly, a navy member keeping look out on the deck gave a loud cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s big leader and the others.” the captain in charge of that boat instantly showed a happy expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other navy members stopped the tasks at hand, and moved to the front of the ship to welcome big leader and the others’ return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were still 4000 people in the ship legion, but not many were left with fighting strength. It was extremely difficult for them to return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they made it to the ships, Big Leader Xu Kuang stopped in his tracks, and he looked at Chu Mu who was riding on Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered something, and he took out the ocean lord token and handed it back to Big Leader Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You killed 2000 members of my navy legion and an ocean commander. But you proceeded to save 4000 people and a group of commanders. This is a bit unbalanced of a tradeoff.” Big Leader Xu Kuang rubbed his temples and looked like he was troubled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many border territories had their own rules. Chu Mu’s actions were no different from killing one person and saving two. Saving people was merely a question of virtue, but killing someone was to commit a crime. If they were to really go by the navy legion’s rules, Chu Mu’s group would still be punished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do as you please.” Chu Mu couldn’t care less. His father had become a Darkness Sect member and was wanted by Divine Sect. If he himself didn’t have a criminal record or had commited his own share of crimes, that would be inexcusable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Xu Kuang bitterly laughed. Chu Mu really was an indifferent fellow. Did he really look down that much on their navy?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Xu Kuang lifted his head and looked at the navy members. In a loud voice he said: “Do any of you remember how Zhao De and his subordinates died?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big leader, I remember.” an ocean soldier from Zhao De’s camp spoke up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BIg Leader Xu Kuang glared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Zhao De’s subordinate said with a straight face: “Ocean Commander Zhao De abused his power and provoked an idle expert. We’re not sure where the killer has gone.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Xu Kuang satisfactorily nodded his head. Leader Hai Qie and Leader Tie Bing all laughed, and didn’t say anything more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao De and his subordinates were a group of vermin. The committed many evil deeds and Big Leader Xu Kuang had already been thinking of sorting them out. The unfortunate thing was that there were proper and upright navy members that lost their lives with them, but Zhao De, as an ocean commander, should be the one to take the blame for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Leader Xu Kuang couldn’t leave the criminal name on Chu Mu. Indeed, if Chu Mu had wanted to on Yellow Springs Path, their 4000 ocean members could have all died there, since the Yellow Springs Chu Mu was riding on was capable of commanding a large corpse army of several tens of thousands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your ship is broken, right? How about I gift you one.” said Xu Kuang.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">。</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, thanks.” Chu Mu nodded his head and didn’t reject this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we’ll say goodbye here. If you have a chance, make a trip to our Wupan territory.” said Xu Kuang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll head there very soon.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wupan territory was probably on the other side of Dark Sky Ocean World, and Chu Mu felt it was about time to go visit that girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night’s species rank was commander, and without the demon crown, it would be suppressed by its species bottleneck, unable to enter the immortal rank. The old raccoon man had told Chu Mu that Night already possessed the qualifications to enter the immortal rank. Therefore, Chu Mu had to break Night’s species restriction first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The best way to break through the species restriction was to find Ning Maner. It was her that had broken Ning and the Devil Tree’s species restrictions back then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides Night, Ning, Devil Tree, and Zhan Ye all had species restrictions. Thus, Chu Mu had to make some preparations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they boarded the navy legion boat, Sang Ying was extremely excited, because this was the first time he was personally captaining a navy legion ocean commander rank boat. He was feeling extremely excited after he boarded the boat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the boat was slowly pulling away from the island, Night seemed to sense something .It suddenly turned around, and ran to the stern of the boat and stared at the tall precipice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the tall precipice, three creatures were silently standing there, watching the boat leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu look. It’s the Angry Horn Devil, the Shadow Beast and the Seven Sins Fox Rock Emperor… the rock emperor also seems to be wearing the demon crown!” Prince Chao pointed at the tall precipice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu walked to the stern and indeed saw the three powerful demons. The Seven Sins Fox Rock Emperor had succeeded Night’s glory, and was now wearing the demon crown!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of the four great demons on the middle island, three were standing on the tall precipice while Night was standing at the stern of the boat, slowly moving off into the distance. The four demons silently stared at each other, but didn’t make any noise. It seemed that the messages they wanted to convey could be done through their gazes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gradually, the three demons grew further and further in the distance and blurry. Those three demons were also unable to see Night, but they still looked on…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had climbed from the very bottom level of the middle island to the peak together. They were separating now, but there would be a time in the future when they would meet again at some demonic peak!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, I did a count. Haha. There are so many resources. After we return to Wanxiang City, those old fellows will definitely jump in fright!” laughed Old Li.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before leaving Demonic Burial Mound, Chu Mu had brought Night and Old Li through the middle island to plunder. Old Li innately was a treasure searching expert and practically no item could escape his eyes. Thus, after tyrannizing the land, they obtained many xuan items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they also knew when to stop. Although Night was the strongest existence on the middle island, if they provoked too many of the leading demons and they banded together, this would bring them much trouble. Therefore, after cleaning through enough, Chu Mu and Night decide to retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Night stored many good things as well. Moreover, they seemed to be specially prepared for young master’s other soul pets. For example, this upper quality Ghost Stone will allow the Ghost King to step into the high class dominator rank without problem. Then, there’s this ninth rank Wood Xuan Leaf. Hehe, this is quite the force. Although it cannot raise the Devil Tree to the high class or peak dominator rank, but it will still give it equivalent offensive force to a wood type peak dominator rank!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And then this eighth rank Dark Heart. You can leave this for Zhan Ye. If you have a chance, you should collect a few more Combining Ambers to combine this dark type item and that beast insect soul core. This will strengthen Zhan Ye even more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The remaining items are almost all xuan. I estimated that there’s about 30 thousand xuan. To put this into perspective, 50 thousand xuan is equivalent to a the price of a peak dominator rank xuan item…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he listened to Old Li’s description, Chu Mu felt disbelief that Night would be so rich.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s biggest problem now was the xuan items for his other soul pets. Night, Mo Xie, Zhan Ye and the Little Hidden Dragon had rather high ranks, but his other soul pets were lagging behind. This normally meant that the main pets would obtain fighting training to increase their strength while the secondary pets had to be dragged up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Chu Mu liked to develop his pets in balance. Therefore, this wasn’t a good thing. Yet, he had many soul pets, and he couldn’t just find xuan items everywhere. This was where Chu Mu had a headache.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But ultimately, NIght had brought him a huge amount of wealth this time, effectively resolving this problem! This would allow Chu Mu to place his attention on strengthening his secondary soul pets and raising their composite power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Mo Xie, the LIttle Hidden Dragon and Zhan Ye, he only needed to raise his own soul remembrance and their speed of growth would also speed up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Chu Mu’s excited expression, Old Li coughed and said: “These are only Night’s riches. Next is what we plundered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I did a count. Besides the 8000 xuan we collected beforehand, we plundered a total of 20 thousand xuan from Demonic Burial Mound. In total, that gives us around 30 thousand xuan. Added on Night’s 30 thousand xuan, we made a total of 60 thousand xuan from here.” Old Li stroked his beard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">60 thousand xuan!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a huge number. It would be impossible to obtain 60 thousand xuan from a place like Cloud Realm. Indeed, the Devil Soul auction from then had slightly depressed Cloud Realm’s economy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have a few fifth rank and above xuan items and we have various attributes of xuan items. If they were all the same attributed xuan items and we were to sell them to a high ranking xuan teacher, perhaps they would be willing to exchange it for a peak dominator rank xuan item. However, the xuan items don’t all have the same uses if their attributes are different. Unless young master is able to find an enormous exchange place, it will be difficult to exchange for a ninth rank and above dominator rank xuan item. Young master, what do you plan on doing?” asked Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu only had xuan items on him, not pure xuan material currency. These items could all be exchanged and then used to purchase other items. Or, they could be pooled together for a dominator rank xuan item. However, if they were exchanged, the value of the xuan item they exchanged for would be much lower. Indeed, if they went to a big border city exchange, with so many items they had to use to exchange, the middle man would take a large commission during the exchange. Therefore, Old Li estimated that if they went to an exchange, they would lose at least 10 thousand xuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">10 thousand xuan was capable of raising a high class dominator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, an exchange wasn’t optimal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s leave it in Wanxiang City. I can’t use the low ranking xuan items and Prince Chao, Mu Qingyi, Xia Zhixia, and Ye Wansheng have probably all stepped over the middle class dominator barrier. There are many low ranking xuan items and we can use them to amplify Wanxiang City’s overall strength.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, Wanxiang City is a bottomless hole. Are you sure you don’t want to use these xuan to raise your own strength?” asked Old Li, somewhat astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although exchanging it would be troublesome and would reduce the value, these would still be able to exchange for a peak dominator rank xuan item at the end of the day. With an extra peak dominator rank soul pet, one’s strength would be completely different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao De deserved his death, but there was one thing he was right about. In front of an enormous faction, a single person’s strength is ultimately insignificant.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
