 <p><strong>Chapter 147: &nbsp;Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox VS Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Chu Mu’s small Mo Xie transform into a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, the spectating Chu Yue’s face turned black again. If he knew earlier that this fellow was Chu Mu, Chu Yue would not have used his sixth level soul armor as a gambling stake no matter what. Yet, what good was it now? Not only did he lose a sixth level soul armor worth 5 million gold coins, &nbsp;but he also allowed himself to suffer punishment. The gains truly didn’t make up for the losses!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox’s strength rivalled a monarch. Every soul pet of Chu Yue’s still hadn’t been strengthened to the pinnacle of the commander level. Even if their phase and stages were higher, it was to no avail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-clothed guard crossed his arms and stood on the edge of the battlefield. His gaze was fixated on Chu Mu’s Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox. Its enormous demonic aura had already extended to his location, and the powerful aura had piqued his intense desire to fight. If it wasn’t for Princess Jin Rou’s existence, no matter what, he wanted to measure himself against Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, if my information isn’t wrong, this Nightmare Palace young princess also has an extremely strong fox species soul pet.” Old Li who was put in Chu Mu’s pet capture ring spoke to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu nodded his head. When he was in Jia City’s city residence, Chu Mu had seen Princess Jin Rou summon a small fox species soul pet. Moreover, he had often seen Princess Jin Rou carrying a noble small fox at a few events. Chu Mu didn’t believe at all that she would raise a small house pet, and it very likely was like Chu Mu- a powerful demonic fox possessing the pitiful appearance ability!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Jin Rou lightly bit her lips, yet silently read her incantation. A head of gorgeous fine black hair fluttered in the wind, displaying a beautiful and moving scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation pattern gradually condensed and slowly appeared under Princess Jin Rou’s feet. The pattern possessed an ice colored pattern, and within this pattern was contained a bizarre snowflake-like shape...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, snowflakes like the ones in the pattern flew up and spiralled in the air!! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu wu!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long cry full of a wild aura was let out. Immediately, the ice colored summoning pattern flickered with sparkling and translucent diamond stones. It was elegant and magnificent, and gave others a bone-chilling feeling!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chu Mountain peak was spurred all year by violent winds. Right now, these biting cold winds, under the permeation of the demonic aura, had become abnormally chaotic. Countless tornadoes and dregs of icy snow particles appeared on the battlefield, slashing up the uneven surfaces on the ground!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ice-colored body, graceful and vigorous. Four limbs full of ice cold strength and pure, snowy white fur fluttered in the air. Long fox tails swayed gently as the ice and snow danced about, pervading the surroundings!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towering Ice Cursed Demonic Fox!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demon foxes were half mainstream soul pets amongst demons. The most characteristic thing of the fights was that they possessed terrifying explosive speed and dodging abilities that surpassed other species of soul pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the demon fox species, after countless years of development, two great noble species appeared- the Phantom Tailed Demon Fox, and the Cursed Demon Fox!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox had a mysterious curse on its forehead. It was said that once the curse was undone, it would possess frightening strength that surpassed its rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, the princess’ Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox also possesses the same innate talent as your Royal Flame Nine Tailed Inferno Fox. Perfect strength, perfect speed, perfect intelligence and perfect ice type controlling ability. It identically is a perfect soul pet that rivals monarchs. Young master, you two truly are a pair of perfect old enemies. Unexpectedly, both of you possess extremely rare soul pets and moreover, the attributes counter each other.” immediately said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the princess summon a Tower Ice Curse Demon Fox, Chu Mu was shocked in his heart. He completely didn’t expect such a powerful old enemy to appear for his practically unrivalled Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Demon Fox. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice type countered the fire type. When it came to attributes, Mo Xie was at the disadvantage. Furthermore, the identically perfect speed, strength, and intelligence of the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox’s fighting definitely wasn’t much inferior to Mo Xie!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the uneven mountain peak battlefield, a raging royal flame and bone chilling cold ice aura crashed against each other. Ice and fire were old enemies. In the audience, everyone was staring at the opposing evil pupils on the battlefield from these two perfect soul pets. The entire Great Chu Family was once more in an uproar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Demon Fox! Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox!! Merely the royal flames and cold ice auras were enough to stun everyone’s hearts!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a magnificent pinnacle fight of two of the most perfect commander rank soul pets predestined to fight! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Previously I had wanted my Bing Ying to fight against your Mo Xie.” Princess Jin Rou’s two star-like pupils stared at Chu Mu. Even if her face was covered, he could still sense the faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu didn’t say anything. This was the first time Chu Mu had seen a Towering Ice Curse Demon Fox. He fundamentally could not determine its phase, stage, and rank from its outside appearance. However, from its dense bone chilling and ice cold aura, Chu Mu could be certain that this Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox’s phase and stage were definitely above Mo Xie’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no wonder Princess Jin Rou’s reputation was so high. With such a soul pet, there was no one who could contend against her in the entire Western Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu wu~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu wu~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one emperor. Two emperor species demon foxes had come across each other, ostensibly igniting the most vigorous will to fight. Mo Xie’ silver eyes coldly and arrogantly stared at the Towering Ice Curse Demon Fox. Her claws had already, at some unknown time, buried themselves into the ground!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let them fight first.” calmly said Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment her voice faded, Princess Jin Rou’s Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox suddenly strode forward. The imposing frozen ice was like a terrifying storm that swept towards Chu Mu’s Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie!” Chu Mu identically gave Mo Xie an order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her royal flames were burning and despite being countered by attribute and despite her phase and stage being lower than the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox, Mo Xie wasn’t the least bit afraid. Possessing the double layers burning effect of demon fire evil flames and blood fire, a sudden raging flame wave surged forth. Facing the whistling stormy snow cold ice, they fiercely clashed in the center of the battlefield!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu hu hu hu!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frozen ice and royal flame strengths collided, and the scarlet blood deep red interweaved with a deep, icy white color. Suddenly, a violent swelling force surged into the surroundings. The gangling of ice and fire, razing the mountain summit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the contest of elemental control, the Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox and the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox immediately switched to an absolute speed showdown. The fire and ice energies were still proliferating, and one was able to see two foxes’ barely visible figures changing locations constantly in the battlefield. Disappearing then reappearing, their claws clashed against each other, creating violent sparks!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Violent Blood Pupil!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation had already been chanted. Compared to the princess’ Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox, Mo Xie was clearly inferior by a level. Chu Mu had to add the Violent Blood Pupil onto Mo Xie to increase her phase and stage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The colors of his pupils began to change and, as the incantation finished, Chu Mu’s eyes had transformed into a blood red color. It was terrifyingly demonic, and such strength caused Chu Mu’s entire being to seem a bit bloody and devilish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie naturally could feel her master use the soul technique. Her nine gorgeous tails abruptly spread apart, and like a plethora of silver clouds, danced in the air!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Tail Confuse, the most absolute dodging technique. The towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox’s frozen ice claws only managed to streak across the location of Mo Xie’s Nine Tail Confuse waving tails. Yet, they didn’t actually damage any part of her body; instead, Mo Xie had charged more than ten meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her silver eyes gradually dyed in a red color. The advent of the violent Blood Pupil caused Mo Xie’s naturally silver body to be seemingly draped by a blood colored armor, and the blood flame’s effects from the double royal flames hugely increased!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood flames caused the soul pet’s bloodiness to increase. Furthermore, with the Violent Blood Pupils’ stimulation, it not only allowed all of Mo Xie’s potential to burst forth, but also allowed the blood flames fire strength to increase by a bit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie had already reached the sixth phase seventh stage. The Violent Blood Pupil’s effect that Chu Mu, who had reached the spirit master level, had released, was much stronger than before. After being draped by the blood colored battle armor, Mo Xie’s strength instantly reached the peak of the sixth phase ninth stage, already extremely close to the seventh phase!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Jin Rou naturally had seen Chu Mu’s Violent Blood Pupil before. Since Chu Mu had used a soul technique, then she identically chanted an incantation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Princess Jin Rou used wasn’t similar to the Violent Blood Pupil where it raised the soul pet’s phase and stage. She sensed that Chu Mu’s Mo Xie still had the advantage in speed and could instantly dodge the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox’s techniques. Thus, she used Bewildering Phantom Ring, which directly increased a soul pet’s speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bewildering Phantom Ring! Although the effects of this technique were not as direct as the Violent Blood Pupil, in a pinnacle fight between speed vs speed, the Bewildering Phantom Ring’s use was extremely evident!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu wu wu!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the Violent Blood Pupil’s results, Mo Xie’s fighting spirit was even more exuberant. Her entire body’s fighting blood was violently burning in the wake of the roasting blood flame!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her steps faintly stepping into stride, the body of Mo Xie burning everywhere with royal flames, outlandishly disappeared from the battlefield. In this instant, practically every young generation member could not find Mo Xie’s trace!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Illusion!” Chu Mu apathetically let out an order!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next instant, Mo Xie strangely appeared in front of the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox. However, it wasn’t only one figure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four Nine Tailed Inferno Foxes burning in vigorous royal flames appeared, and they were ostensibly impossible to differentiate in authenticity!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Flame Claw!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her short body quickly flitted past and suddenly, four long Royal Flame Claws appeared in the air. Mo Xie, whose strength had approached the seventh phase, under the effects of the full form offensive soul claw, caused the might to astonishingly reach the eighth rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An eighth rank in might attack. It seemingly could insta-kill any eighth phase and under non strengthened soul pet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four claw blades shockingly flashed into existence, causing everyone inside and outside the stage to suck in a breath of air. Those self-proclaimed peak young experts in the Great Chu Family began to ask themselves, honestly, if any of their soul pets could resist such a degree of attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such an imposing offensive that ostensibly could not be defended against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only, when Mo Xie’s claws ripped apart, Chu Mu creased his eyebrows. This was because as Mo Xie launched her attack, Chu Mu could clearly feel a slight blurriness occur with the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox’s body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four claws ripped apart the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox’s body, but as the body was split apart, the ice colored demon fox’s figure slowly dissipated! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie, Flame Dance!” abruptly realizing the Towering Ice Cursed Demon Fox had avoided Mo Xie’s attack, Chu Mu’s heart tensed up, and he immediately issued an order to Mo Xie!</span></p>
