  <p></p>
  <div class="paragraph">
   Mo Xie’s transformation didn’t end. Her body began to grow larger and her figure grew even more elegant, simultaneously filling with an even larger feeling of strength. Her supple silver tail emitted an even more grand and icy arrogance!
   <p></p>
   <p>“Wu!!!”</p>
   <p>In the blackness of night, an edge of a precipice hung over an ocean. Mo Xie, immersed in the brilliant dawn of transformation, unfurrowed her body and let out a cold howl towards the moon. The sound crashed against the sea waves, reverberating with the ocean’s scream!</p>
   <p>Chu Mu knew that Mo Xie’s current transformation pertained to her form, and she would thus enter a period of deep sleep afterwards to truly change her inner essence. As for this period of deep sleep, it was the most optimal time to use soul crystals to instruct her.</p>
   <p>Presently, Chu Mu was unable to change whether or not he had soul power and immediately retrieved the precious soul crystals from his carrying bag.</p>
   <p>“Mo Xie, eat this!” Chu Mu used his soul power to seal the soul crystal’s energy to ensure that the energy would be released only after Mo Xie ate it.</p>
   <p>The energy within the soul crystals was absolutely enormous. This sort of energy needed to be slowly absorbed. Trying to do it all in one go would render a soul pet unable to absorb it all.</p>
   <p>Soul pets were unable to control their own slow absorption of this sort of soul crystal Energy. Therefore, while absorbing soul crystal energy, soul pet trainers had to be extremely attentive, while also prudently completing this training phase.</p>
   <p>“Beast type as the primary and fire type as an auxiliary. The soul crystal’s energy should persist for three days. Mo Xie, these three days are crucial for your strength to increase. After completion, even if you don’t change to a different race, your strength will definitely not be inferior to that of a high rank soul pet!” Chu Mu’s confidence instantly increased; there was nothing that was more important than growing stronger and of more value than the inner waves surging in his heart!</p>
   <p>“Wu!” Mo Xie let out a howl. After transforming, the tiredness slowly crept up and she very obediently went back into the soul space to receive Chu Mu’s soul Crystal training.</p>
   <p>A soul pet’s training was chosen extremely carefully!</p>
   <p>Chu Mu didn’t immediately return to his wooden hut. He poured his mental ideas into the soul space and slowly controlled the dual element soul Crystal which he had already put soul Power into.</p>
   <p>The more more elements there were, the harder it would become to properly control the energy’s release. What Chu Mu had to currently accomplish was to allow the beast type energy to slowly be released first in order for Mo Xie to first receive the most pure beast type energy’s baptism!</p>
   <p>Fortunately, Chu Mu was a soul soldier and his soul remembrance was strong enough to achieve this sort of meticulous control.</p>
   <p>When inputting his soul remembrance into a soul crystal, soul pet trainers were able to see the soul crystal’s crown. The soul crystal’s crown was like a gorgeous and fascinating halo that rotated around the center of the soul crystal’s inside, and it represented the soul crystal’s energy.</p>
   <p>When Chu Mu entered the inside of this soul crystal, he saw two layers of different colored soul crystal crowns- brown and red.</p>
   <p>The brown-colored attributed indicated the beast type while red signified the fire type. These two soul crystal crown layers of brown and red colors respectively, signified that this soul crystal was dual attributed.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu slowly locked his soul remembrance on the slightly unstable brown colored soul crystal crown and began to slowly draw this energy into Mo Xie’s body.</p>
   <p>Only 20% of the 100% beast type soul crystal crown’s energy was drawn out by Chu Mu before slowly pouring into Mo Xie’s body.</p>
   <p>……</p>
   <p>After Mo Xie’s body experienced the transformation baptism, another change occurred: The flesh of her four limbs and trunk clearly expanded...</p>
   <p>Simultaneously, Chu Mu’s soul remembrance locked onto the red colored soul crystal crown, drawing out about 10% of the energy before slowly pouring it into Mo Xie’s body.</p>
   <p>The introduction of fire type energy caused Mo Xie’s body to change immediately. An unexpectedly beautiful sun-setting red luster appeared on her silver white fur. This sort of luster was hidden within the silver fur and only when one moved his eyes would one be able to see it!</p>
   <p>The energy needed to be slowly absorbed. Chu Mu couldn’t be overhasty, so today’s training could only go so far. He had to wait until Mo Xie’s body completely absorbed the twenty percent &nbsp;beast type energy and the twenty percent fire type energy before continuing training...</p>
   <p>“Nevertheless, I hope that the training this time will succeed.” Having completed this extremely essential training which focused on mental strength, Chu Mu also let out a light sigh of relief.</p>
   <p>Soul pet trainers paid an extreme amount of attention to their soul pet’s training. For instance, a Moonlight Fox had a primary demon type attribute and an auxiliary beast type attribute. In reality, if a soul pet trainer used a Moonlight Fox to fight, he or she would primarily train the demon attribute and the beast type attribute secondarily. Ordinary food was two demon type soul crystals and one beast type Soul Crystal. After all, the innate demon skills of a Moonlight Fox were stronger, and this sort of feeding method allowed their demon abilities to be exhibited to their limit.</p>
   <p>Another example was a Hunting Wolf. A Hunting Wolf was a purely beast type organism and increasing other attributes was essential. For example, fire and ice-water could make a Hunting Wolf’s attacks even more dangerous. However, the taboo was that the fire and ice attributes absolutely could not become the primary way of raising the Hunting Wolf. A Hunting Wolf’s innate gift for magic was extremely low and trying to enhance magic properties was equivalent to teaching a deer the ability to hunt. It was up to the soul pet trainer himself to determine how much a soul pet’s respective attribute proportions should be trained in order for the soul pet to exhibit the largest possible strength.</p>
   <p>It could be said that training a soul pet was an extremely profound study conducted by soul pet trainers. Different soul pets required different training methods. Even if it was an identical soul pet, there could still be different training methods.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu and Mo Xie were relatively special existences. If Mo Xie was simply a Moonlight Fox, Chu Mu’s training method focusing on the beast attribute primarily, fire attribute secondarily and demon attribute forthwith would absolutely throttle the Moonlight Fox’s demon ability. It would thereby be extremely implausible for Mo Xie’s attacking power to increase.</p>
   <p>Once this sort of training ended, this soul pet would simply become insignificant. Its beast type energy wasn’t as good as a few Hunting Wolves, the effect of its fire attribute would also be inferior to fire ability soul pets, and the demon type that itself was naturally good at would become completely abandoned.</p>
   <p>However, the reason why Chu Mu was so adherent to Mo Xie using this method to increase her offensive ability was because Mo Xie was a soul pet that could change races. Chu Mu doing such training was actually equivalent to laying the foundations for Mo Xie’s race changes, causing Mo Xie’s fighting abilities to equal the terrifying Nine-tailed Demon Fox transformation and not the cowardly Silver Moon Fox or Demon Moon Fox!</p>
   <p>Chu Mu himself was unable to completely ensure that Mo Xie would definitely transform into a Nine-tailed Demon Fox, so this sort of training method required Mo Xie to strive for it herself when she trained in the future, as well as a bit of luck.</p>
   <p>There were innumerable methods for soul pets to train as well as innumerable transformations. No matter which training method the soul pet trainer picked, the most important goal was to make the soul pet even stronger, with better adaptability in fights!</p>
