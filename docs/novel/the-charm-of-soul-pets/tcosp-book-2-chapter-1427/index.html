 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two snake dragons slowly got up from the ground as they trembled. When they were facing most of their enemies, the snake dragons would usually use their enormous bodies to compete in a match of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before the Ghost King, that method could no longer work. Furthermore, the two snake dragons really did not know what to do when they were facing a rock giant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their toxins were useless against rock type creatures. If they used their sharp teeth to bite, then they had to consider if their teeth would shatter instead. If they were to wrap around it, then it might be able to just tear them apart with its immense strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King did not bother with using any complicated method to take on the enemy. It just simply kept swinging its sword towards the two snake dragons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snake dragons usually liked to employ various different methods in their fights. They would occasionally fly into the sky and would attempt to suppress Ghost King from there since it had trouble taking the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the snake dragons swam into the sky, Ghost King certainly seemed to be unable to exert its full power. However, the snake dragons were also close-range combat creatures. Their long-range techniques were clearly nothing in front of Ghost King’s robust body. Ghost King just kept up its solid defense and did not try to chase after the snake dragons after they escaped into the air. Neither side could really do anything and they just glared at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you two doing!?” In the distance, Zeng Long noticed that two of his subordinates were fighting so passively while he was busy fighting against the Martial Cloud Dragon and roared in an annoyed tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord, this giant race is truly troublesome......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough nonsense, finish off that kid right now!” Zeng Long did not bother to listen to their excuses and scolded them in return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snake tattoos on their faces started bending like earthworms as their expression also turned bitter soon after. Rock type creatures were famous for their defense, even more so for the giant race amongst the rock type. Some common tactics that the snake dragons used were completely ineffective before the giant race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them did not dare to defy Zeng Long any more and forced themselves to descend a little towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King’s body was as tall as a mountain. Once the two snake dragons lowered their height a little, it immediately welcomed them happily with its curved sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snake dragons managed to dodge with some effort. They flung their long tails and whipped them heavily onto Ghost King’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King was currently in offensive mode, but its defense was originally terrifyingly high. Such attacks from the snake dragons would usually have been fatal, but they were utterly ineffective against the Ghost King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The curved sword was instantly swung down, a deep sword trail was distinctly carved into the sky, accompanied by the chilling ghost fire. The green Poison Snake Dragon suffered a deep fatal cut from that attack and its green blood sprayed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When did your Ghost King become so strong?” Princess Jin Rou looked up at Ghost King with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost King was currently facing off against two snake dragons. Previously, Mo Xie was still having a hard time taking on a single snake dragon. However, once Ghost King appeared, it did not even unleash any flashy techniques or use some complicated battle tactics, yet it was able to easily suppress the two snake dragons like two little snakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Chu Mu also did not know that the giant race was the bane of the snake dragon race. Snake dragons were cunning and despicable, their attacks were usually poisonous. However, before the giant race which had absolute defense and also immense strength, all of their tactics were simply like jokes and became utterly ineffective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon swam very fast in the sky. It left behind a trail in the path it travelled on, forming a golden diagram. This diagram possessed the power to restrain. When the Martial Cloud Dragon passed through it, the diagram immediately rooted the Martial Cloud Dragon on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ao~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon roared and tried to use brute force to struggle out of the creepy golden restrain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long simply sneered, and changed focus onto Chu Mu instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon was really strong, and he would not be able to defeat it in a short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After realizing that, Zeng Long no longer wanted to waste any time on the Martial Cloud Dragon. Hence, he purposely used a little trick to temporarily restrain the Martial Cloud Dragon in the Golden Snake Diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The restrain could only last for a few seconds. However, it was enough time for Zeng Long to finish off Chu Mu who possessed the Monument Tear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon dove straight down, turning into a streak of golden lightning and it split open the dark sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of Chu Mu’s soul pets were busy fighting against other snake dragons. Zeng Long reached the ground without any hindrance and instantly approached Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon saw that the enemy playing dirty and it became even more furious. A blue dragon force filled its entire body and it forcefully shattered the golden diagram!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After breaking free from it, the Martial Cloud Dragon immediately closed up its wings and performed a free fall to chase after the golden snake dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long took a glance at the Martial Cloud Dragon and sneered at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon would not be able to make it in time with such a distance between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really think that I will keep getting caught up by that stupid dragon? You need to use your brain a little to achieve your objective!” mocked Zeng Long as he got closer to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zeng Long was talking, his golden snake dragon opened its mouth and bit down decisively towards Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon’s gullet was really deep, it looked as if a spatial black hole was approaching them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou was already in a spectral state, so that attack was clearly ineffective against her. She instead looked at Chu Mu with worry and intended to chant an incantation to resist the attack for Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu raised his head and was unexpectedly calm while in front of the huge snake mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stench that was coming from the golden snake dragon’s mouth spread towards him. Darkness filled his sight completely, he could only see its red forked tongue and its wriggling gullet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou became even more anxious. She could resist some attacks with her mental technique. However, this golden snake dragon’s rank was too high for her, so she was unsure if she could properly block it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right before she was about to start chanting, black Devil Fire slowly ignited from the ground beneath them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devil Fire did not spread too quickly. After it gradually covered the bodies of Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou, their bodies appeared to have been burned into ashes, and blown away by the air the golden snake dragon exhaled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sia!” The golden snake dragon bit down thoroughly, swallowing the black flame and a large chunk of the rock on the ground along with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its snake body twisted and it rapidly ascended after sliding for a while, flying towards a mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon circled around the mountain for a while, as its long body was coiled on top of the mountain. After raising its head, its tail was right at the middle of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha!” laughed Zeng Long from on top of the golden snake dragon’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Monument Tear is mine now, both Seven Sins Fox Light King’s and this kid’s. What a great harvest. Although a few of my men died in the end, it doesn’t matter. Nobody can stop me from becoming a Gate Master now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eminence Zeng is truly incredible as expected......” Enforcer She was still present at the battlefield. She clearly witnessed the scene of the golden snake dragon swallowing Chu Mu and that female spectre whole, so she hurriedly flattered Zeng Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment, Zeng Long really wanted to be praised by others. In a few seconds, his golden snake dragon would start digesting Chu Mu. Meanwhile, the Monument Tears would also become nutrients for his snake dragon. What he needed to do right now was to find a quiet place to wait for his golden snake dragon to complete the digestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, a cluster of black Devil Fire suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Two figures slowly emerged within the fire, they were none other than Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou still maintained the motion of beginning her chanting. When she noticed that she was safe, she looked at Chu Mu with both surprise and confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s laughter came from the mountain from far away. Chu Mu saw that the arrogant fool had gone so crazy already and seemed to have found it funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“E...... Eminence......” The other members of the Snake Dragon Faction saw Chu Mu appearing from within the black fire and hurriedly notified Zeng Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long had certainly become a little too overjoyed, he only reacted after his subordinates called out to him a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw Chu Mu standing far away completely unscathed, his laughing figure instantly petrified. That appearance was as strange as it could become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long clearly remembers that Chu Mu had no other soul pets left around him, so he should not have been able to dodge the golden snake dragon’s bite. He should have been in the stomach of the snake dragon, so there was no way that he could stand there unscathed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How’s the taste of the soil?” mocked Chu Mu from far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s expression became even worse, the dragon tattoos that covered his face were twisting like centipedes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never imagined that he would be fooled by that brat. He no longer cared how Chu Mu was able to escape from his golden snake dragon’s attack, he simple rode on his golden snake dragon and pounced towards Chu Mu once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon appeared before the golden snake dragon right at that moment. It was tricked by that cunning foe once before, so it was really angry right now. Hot air blew out from its nose like a volcano eruption!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the Martial Cloud Dragon, Zeng Long became even more irritated. He gritted his teeth and ordered his golden snake dragon to avoid the Martial Cloud Dragon’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon did not let the golden snake dragon go this time though. It kept slapping down its huge claws at it. The golden snake dragon became dizzy after getting slapped and it almost crashed into the ground a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, isn’t your White Devil still fighting? So how can you still use the ability of Nightmare?” asked Princess Jin Rou after she saw that the battle was turning to their favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I possess the source of its power, so I can still perform some of its evasive or defensive techniques. Actually, I would have been fine even if it bit me,” explained Chu Mu briefly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was not a Half Human, he controlled the power instead. In fact, White Devil was just a subordinate soul. If he summoned White Devil, then he would not be able to use a lot of techniques. However, that did not mean that he was a normal human being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Chu Mu doubted whether that golden snake dragon could really inflict any damage on him. Chu Mu’s physique was different from normal people. His defensive strength was at the level of his half devil transformation. Otherwise, he would not dare to block the techniques of the enemies for his soul pets.</span></p>
