 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the western wetlands to the human faction road, there was a streak of blood that went along the marsh river path and flowed towards the barbarian mountain valley. What used to be dark green swamp ground now had many deep pools died red with blood. Many corpses were drenched in the dirt piles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil crows spiraled in the skies, creating flocks. When the time was right, they all dived towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil crow was a servant rank organism that often appeared a few hundred at a time because only then could they capture more powerful prey. Their prey wasn’t restricted to just the corpses thrown in the wilderness. It also included many hurt and tired soul pets, who they would attack in groups when they found weakness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, in this large wetland wilderness, corpses were all over, and the evil crows in the skies were nearing ten thousand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, these tens of thousands of evil crows still didn’t dare to fall on the ground simply because there still stood a human in the middle of the wilderness full of an inauspicious aura. Beside the human, there were two incredibly vicious emperor rank soul pets that nearly killed half of western wetlands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This human seemed to be red-eyed from killing already. When he lifted his head and looked around, he no longer saw anything living; only far in the skies were the evil crows letting out guttural caws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man seemed to be tired. He lifted his feet through the muddy wetlands as he stared soulessly at his soul pets, “That should be enough killing to commemorate everyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he spoke, the man started to walk slowly out of the forbidden realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one would understand that half of all the lives in the third rank tribe, totalling multiple ten thousand soul pets, were just for the man to commemorate his dead family…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the edge of the forbidden realm, the man summoned Ice Cloud Crane, and retracted his two emperor rank soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since everyone was dead, he felt there was nothing to be concerned for anymore. He didn't want to stay here either, so he planned on going east from there all the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">East of the western wetlands meant he had to pass by near seven color city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man rode his Ice Cloud Crane, as he glanced aimlessly at the ground rendered even more desolate after the ravaging of the western wetlands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Cloud Crane flew very high, and its angle of vision was very wide; the mountains, valleys, hills, and basins were all in sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, while he was going from the barbarian valley towards seven color city, he noticed a winding, thin black line that slowly moved towards seven color city!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man concentrated his soul remembrance towards the area and found it was actually a large group of people methodically in line to migrate from barbarian valley to seven color city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This many residents? What happened?” The man said to himself. Immediately, he told Ice Cloud Crane to fly towards that region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he got nearer and nearer, tens of thousands of refugee-like people slowly came into sight. Aside all these refugees were a bunch of soul pet trainers protecting them with soul pets as they travelled towards seven color city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu Di’s Ice Cloud Crane was a pseudo monarch rank soul pet. When this soul pet came down from above, it immediately lifted a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moving seven color city residents noticed the powerful soul pet appear and were all alarmed. Only when they realized that it was a human expert that they slowly calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Commander Li Zuofeng recognized Ice Cloud Crane. It was the spirit emperor expert that single-handedly caused all of the western wetlands tribes to retreat, so he immediately ran up to the crane and saluted respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boss Qiu, Boss Qiu, you’re back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other few high commanders also knew that this Boss Qiu had a higher position than even kingdom master Luo Hei. It wasn’t only his identity and power, however. A huge reason why this calamity was this quickly averted was mostly because of this spirit emperor’s efforts. As for the western kingdom army, they mostly just cleaned up the remains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is with these these people?” Qiu Di looked at the long refugee line and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re seven color city residents. When the disaster started, a young spirit emperor moved them all to barbarian valley. Using the geography there, they avoided the disaster and they were in the region with the highest survival rate this disaster.” Li Zuofeng quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Li Zuofeng’s words, Qiu Di’s lifeless eyes suddenly burst with color as he quickly asked, “Then is seven color city Chu clan part of the survivors?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Zuofeng was secretly strange as to why this Boss Qiu cared so much for the Chu family. Seeing him this worried, he quickly added, “Yes, Chu Family people are all still alive. They’re at the end of this group of people, boss you……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Li Zuofeng finished speaking, he saw the expert that saved western kingdom suddenly turn around and walk straight to the end of the team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the achievement of killing most of western wetlands, Qiu Di didn’t seem to mind that much. When he walked to the end of the team, he retracted his Ice Cloud Crane to avoid attracting too much attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Li Zuofeng and the few commanders still followed tightly behind Qiu Di because they knew the true savior of western kingdom was the man in front of them. He himself swept through nearly half of western wetlands by himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the migrating team was Chu Family. Chu Family had around 500 people. Because of the plague, around 100 old men and women lost their lives. Now that the danger was finally past, the entire Chu Family looked incredibly slumped and tired, slowly stepping out of barbarian valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu Di walked to the edge of barbarian valley before finally finding a bunch of chu family people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the people in Chu family he didn’t recognize, including the direct young generation members descendants. The ones he truly had an impression of were his brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu Di didn’t immediately walk over, instead standing a distance away, watching like a stranger at the old men all reaching middle age. Though his expression didn’t change, his eyes betrayed a new emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, if nothing had happened, Qiu Di probably could’ve maintained an emotionless face or even watched as a stranger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, after the disaster, after a near miss with death and a massacre that took over his body, this nomad who went out for nearly twenty years finally understood that, no matter how much he rejected some things, they were still just as precious as day one, just hidden deeper in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His face’s lack of expression was built through years of roaming everywhere. However, his eyes betrayed his true emotions. At this moment, Qiu Di was standing aside, eyes showing gratification, yet also some bitterness…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That must be Tianheng. He seems much older now.” Qiu Di muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That person is so strange, standing there and watching us” Chu Yishui pointed at the stranger and said to her sister Chu Qian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Qian also glanced at the old man but didn’t give it much thought, “Probably some army’s commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu He walked by the man, he took a few extra glances but didn’t say much, instead continuing to walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young generation members walked over, and Chu Tianheng was getting closer and closer. However, at this moment, Qiu Di turned his body around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu Di didn’t plan on truly meeting them. Since they were still alive, and he had seen most of it, it was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Taincheng isn’t here. We couldn’t even offer some sacrifices from him. It’s been so many years that no one knows where he went. If he knew his father would pass away, he must feel extremely bad, too.” Qiu Tianheng said quietly to Chu Tainehng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianheng’s face was gloomy. This disaster of Chu family finally safely passed. However, at the same time, the old man Chu Ming also left this world, and was buried by everyone inside barbarian valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Chu Tianheng finished speaking, the stranger suddenly stepped forward and grabbed hold of Chu Tianheng’s collar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you say, what did you just say!!!!!!!!” The stranger yelled, immediately startling all of chu clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianlin felt it bizarre, as he looked at the cleanly dressed man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This friend, if you have something to say, say it slowly, don’t get too excited.” Chu Tianheng quickly pushed down the stranger’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, just when Chu Tianheng finished speaking, his entire body froze as he stared in disbelief at the unfamiliar yet familiar face!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are…..you are third brother!!” Chu Tianheng said with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianlin only then saw the man’s appearance. He grabbed onto the man’s arm as he stared dumbfounded, “Tianren! It really is you!! You…...you’re finally back!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianren, Chu Ming’s third son- news said he died in the wilderness at a young age. However, only Chu family members really knew that Chu Tianren left the family alone because he had a great dispute between father and brothers. The first time he left, it was for three years. While the second time he left, it was a dozen years ago or more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused Chu Tianheng and Chu Tianlin both to believe he was dead. THey hadn’t thought he would finally appear now!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu Di saw that he was immediately recognized by his brothers, and dropped all disguises. Instead, he asked seriously, “Father…...he really……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking to here, Chu Tianheng and Chu Tianlin all fell silent, and didn’t dare to say more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing both brothers stopping their words, Chu Tianren knew it was the truth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The previous moment, seeing Chu family people all alive, he could still remain calm and watch aside. However, at this moment, the eyes of this expert, who single handedly destroyed half of western wetlands, were brimming with tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Tianren was free, and had a stubborn yet firm personality. Even when he left home, even though he never swore any deadly oaths or ever say that he would never want to see his father again until death, he was stubborn. However, when he heard of the disaster in western kingdom, he immediately came over from the nearby kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First Gangluo City was safe, which caused him to let out a breath. Soon, he found out that Chu family migrated to the western region, which fell to the disaster, which caused him to go crazy with grief, starting a massacre in western wetlands. After, he found that Chu family actually survived, which caused him to experience great joy….. Yet finally, the person he should have seen the most had left forever…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people had to experience the divide between life and death before they appreciated the preciousness of family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Chu Tianren finally understood this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Or else, why else would an expert who defeated half of a third level tribe, facing hundreds of thousands of enemies, stagger, dazed, towards the burial grounds in barbarian valley…...</span></p>
