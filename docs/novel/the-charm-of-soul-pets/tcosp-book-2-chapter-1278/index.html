 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crown Ocean City was the border city of Crown Border. Wupan territory was the closest neighbor to New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This border city happened to be the garrison of Wupan Navy’s Ninth Division.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crown City’s harbor was extremely large and could contain several hundred ocean vessels. When New Moon Navy docked in the harbor, there were many other ships anchored there already. However, the silver warship that led 30 other ships behind it quickly attracted the gazes of everyone in the harbor. The New Moon Land navy members standing on the ship could see that the people on the decks of the other ships were looking at them and were discussing amongst each other in astonishment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Building a boat like this required a huge amount of capital. Even Crown City wouldn’t necessarily be able to easily fork up the money to create a ship legion like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they received permission, the thiry warships orderly stopped at a stand alone small harbor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s rest a few days here before we head to that island.” said Sang Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving a few navy members to look after the ships, the others began to wander around Crown City. Yuan Sui specified to the navy members not to stir up trouble. At the end of the day, this was a border city, and they wouldn’t be able to resolve things easily if they stirred up trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuan Sui was in charge of recruiting members and all of the navy members were personally chosen by him, and they were of high quality. Chu Mu could feel this from the two months they had spent voyaging so far.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, how are you doing? I’ve been waiting here for a while.” just after they disembarked from the ship, they were met by a charming and flirtatious woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Lan Rao.” Pang Yue instantly recognized this female soul pet trainer who had stayed a few years in Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them knew each other quite well so Pang Yue immediately walked up to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After staying a few years in Wanxiang City, she had chosen to leave. But she had heard New Moon Land had created a navy and was planning on coming here, so she ordered people to wait at the harbor and when New Moon Navy arrived, they would immediately inform her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu, do you remember me?” flirtatiously smiled Lan Yao as she spoke to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember. You specially came to welcome us?” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. How could I not come to welcome you when you personally came to our Wupan territory. If you have anything you need help with, just ask me.” Lan Yao was quite cordial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After staying a few years in Wanxiang City, she had a bit of feelings for that place. Also, her and Pang Yue seemed to be friends with each other, and they had hugged just now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we’ll have to trouble you.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the navy members went off on their own, Lan Rao lead the way for Chu Mu, Ye Wansheng, Chao Lengchuan, Sang Ying, Yuan Sui, Zeng Bangyang and other vice leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao had already prepared residences for everyone at the center of the city where they could rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passing through the bustling streets, Chu Mu gained a completely new understanding of prosperous. This was his first time being in a border city. It wasn’t that border cities were much larger than realm cities, but instead the entire grandeur wasn’t something a realm city could compete with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to eliminate Dark Ocean Pirates?” after hearing why Chu MU and the others were here, Lan Rao instantly showed an expression of amazement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there anything wrong with that?” said Sang Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s nothing wrong with it, only Dark Ocean Pirates, this malignant tumor, really isn’t easy to eliminate. Our ninth division’s navy has sent legions there multiple times to encircle the island and eliminate. However, ultimately, they were all able to escape. Also, rumors have it that Dark Ocean Pirates are growing more and more rampant. There have been a few high ranking navy officers that after committing crimes and being expelled from the navy, have joined Dark Ocean Pirates. Thus, their strength has greatly increased. Their bounty has increased from 9000 xuan to 30 thousand xuan.” said Lan Rao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That much? 30 thousand xuan?” Sang Ying was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The amount Sang Ying had saved up during his lifetime didn’t even reach 30 thousand xuan. If the 30 thousand were to be invested in the navy, the navy’s power would approach the Ninth Division’s Third Ship Legion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This 30 thousand xuan is merely the bounty for the defector, Navy Officer Zhuo Qing. If you are able to completely destroy the Dark Ocean Pirates, there will be other rewards. The pirates are split into many portions and over a hundred of them have bounties. Their sum altogether is an enormous amount. Unfortunately, when a hired legion went to eliminate the island, most of them failed to return. And when Ninth Division’s legion went to encircle the island, the pirates stopped showing themselves. They waited until the situation blew over before they suddenly plundered a city…” said Lan Rao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, the Dark Ocean Pirates would occasionally threaten smaller cities. However, these pirates had now become even more savage and terrifying. Not long ago, a small city had been massacred and it was said that Zhuo Qing had intentionally provoked the Ninth Division’s legions. However, the legions were unable to find any traces of him and now the citizens were begin to discuss the Ninth Division Legion’s ineptitude.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the navy legion had no choice but to raise the bounty, especially Pirate Leader Zhuo Qing who had commited great evil. His bounty had reached 30 thousand xuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Lan Rao, Chu Mu turned to ask Sang Ying: “Are you certain the base of the Dark Ocean Pirates is here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. If it isn’t their main base, they wouldn’t have any reason to store their treasures there. If we are to resolve the situation in Dark Sky Ocean, once our New Moon Land develops, this group of pirates will definitely find trouble for us. We need to get rid of them.” said Sang Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pirates would always go where there was wealth, and it was easy to take advantage of others. New Moon Land was newly developed and the rumours from other realms were that it was full of wealth. There would definitely be many unlawful groups going there to stir up trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu initially felt that a 9000 xuan bounty didn’t even require him to take action. However, this bounty had now reached 30 thousand xuan. Chu Mu was very interested in this. Indeed, the wealth he had plundered from Demonic Burial Mound was 60 thousand xuan altogether. And most importantly, these pirates threatened the safety of New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s spend the next few days collecting some information. Those pirates have been a tumor for a long time now and won’t be easy to deal with.” Chu Mu said to Sang Ying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sang Ying nodded his head. They had to investigate well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they reached their residences, everyone was tired after voyaging on the ocean for over two months. Lan Rao immediately ordered a few servant girls to take them to rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have a good rest. These female servants were personally selected by me. They are clever, obedient, sexy and beautiful. If you like one of them… I’m sure I don’t need to hint anymore, right?” laughed Lan Rao as her eyes flashed with a knowing look towards these men.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eyes of Ye Wansheng, Sang Ying, Zeng Bangyang, and the other vice leaders all lit up. Lan Rao truly understood men too well, especially these men who had voyaged on the ocean for two months without seeing a woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Lan, why are you like this!” next to them, Pang Yue angirly spoke out. When she discovered Zeng Bangyang and the other men excitedly calling these women over to go rest, her face turned even more red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although everyone here was an adult, wasn’t it inappropriate to just have it all out in the open?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, it’s better than them finding those unclean places for this.” said Lan Rao who didn’t care at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pang Yue discovered that Chu Mu, Chao Lengchuan, and Yuan Sui hadn’t moved and she felt somewhat comforted. It seemed that there were at least some men who were reliable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a period of time when Prince Chao had been very unrestrained and was led astray by Ye Wansheng. However, his heart was currently all focused on Xia Zhixian. He had no interest in other women. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, as a clean and honest man, was self-evident. Moreover, he had seen many beautiful women before so he wasn’t very interested in these so-called beautiful servant girls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hero Chief Yuan Sui also wasn’t interested. His wife had passed away when she was young and he hadn’t remarried since. This was evidence of his character.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not tired. Could I trouble you to take me to the navy legion? I need to see someone and perhaps he can give me some information on the pirates.” Chu Mu said to Lan Rao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, but the navy legion isn’t somewhere I can just come and go.” said Lan Rao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The navy division was quite far from where Chu Mu was resting. Their headquarters was a castle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The navy legion’s castle was situated on an enormous ocean cliff that could essentially be described as a mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the bottom of the mountain, the ocean came in via a large river. Currently, there were countless navy ships stopped close together on the river. Together, they nearly formed their own walkable piece of land on the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their tall banners fluttered in the wind. The beautiful scene of thousands of ships stopped on the ocean river left Chu Mu in awe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How many tens of thousands of people could they hold?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the mountain was the imposing and grand navy castle. The entire castle was an ashen white color and its tall pointy watch towers pointed towards the blue sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The size of the navy legion castle was equivalent to a small city. From far away, it was possible to see many wing type soul pets patrolling the castle. These patrol teams were very orderly and would glide by each other at the very top of the castle’s flag, resembling an aerial performance. Simultaneously, it was very careful, dignified and evidenced tight security.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The navy legion castle is a bit imposing. If our Windy Rain City were to create a castle like this, the armies from other realms wouldn’t dare enter our waters at all, let alone pirates, eh?” sighed Chao Lengchuan with emotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the Ninth Division’s navy legion castle. As for the First Division's navy legion castle… if you have the chance, you must go see it.” Lan Rao wasn’t able to find fitting words to describe it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The inside of the First Division’s navy legion castle should all be experts, right?” asked Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course. Those that are able to enter the First Division’s navy legion are experts that are picked once per every thousand kilometers. The First Division’s high ranking officers are even more incredible. Each one of them are great figures with huge prestige in Wupan territory.” said Lan Rao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they walked towards the navy legion castle, a few soldiers halfway up the mountain stopped them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are here to find Big Leader Xu? Please wait a moment. We’ll have someone notify him.” said the soldier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the soldiers went to notify, they waited there. Lan Rao was very curious as to how Chu Mu, who had never been to Wupan territory, recognized the 3rd Ship Legion’s big leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Kuang was a famous big leader in Crown City, and was known even more for being a very eccentric expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she was thinking, she saw a man riding on a soul pet flying very quickly towards them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao looked at him. Wasn’t that Big Leader Xu Kuang himself?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, Brother Chu, I knew you would come.” Xu Kuang’s resonant voice rang out before he had even made it over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This man personally came to welcome him?” Lan Rao was a bit surprised. Xu Kuang was 3rd Navy Legion’s big leader. It was said that even vice city lord ranked people would have to act courteously in front of this man. Why would he be so cordial towards the king from New Moon Land and even come to greet him?&nbsp;</span></p>
