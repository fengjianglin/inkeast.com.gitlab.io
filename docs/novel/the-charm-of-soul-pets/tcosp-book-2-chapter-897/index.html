 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This perhaps was where she was truly terrifying. Nobody could see through her facade!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many other colorful flowers were like this. They were full of poisonous spikes, but they looked oh so beautiful in the eyes of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I look good?” the defector woman had a lovely smile on. Her eyes were charming like a witch as she intended to flirt with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu managed to not lose his mind over her devastating beauty because he was able to remember her betrayal back then as well as her enormous plot in Tianxia City. Thinking of Xiang Rong City, a city of a million, which would be reduced to a flower demon empire, all because of the arrogant and contemptuous woman in front of him, made Chu Mu feel that it was all laughable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t respond. The Empress Concubine was obviously playing with him. She seemed like a genuine beautiful woman attempting to use mental charm to make him distracted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you’re a creature who can’t think.” when the Empress Concubine saw that this silver devil’s eyes were not affected by her mental charm, she coldly sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A flower type’s charm, as long as it was a living creature, including women, would be effective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Empress Concubine fought enemies, she was used to wearing a veil or her golden mask. However, if her appearance were to be revealed, she wouldn’t mind using her soul-devastating looks to take a mental advantage. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally speaking, the mental charm wouldn’t fail because it targeted a creature’s heart and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, if that creature knew everything about her and had a resistance against her, the mental charm would be ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the last chance I’m giving you. Put down the item and you can leave.” the Empress Concubine put emphasis on her words!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A creature that wasn’t capable of thinking could not pose any threat to her. She felt that she was wasting her time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, she didn’t want to reveal her strength before everything had been achieved. If that happened, there was a person who could find trouble for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hua!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a crack was opened up in the space. Chu Mu extended his hand and took the special wooden box out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Empress Concubine saw the special wooden box, a smile immediately rose on her face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was what she wanted. The special spirit energy inside was so dense that it would allow her to breed even more stronger puppet flower demons!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, her smile froze and gradually her expression grew dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That repulsive silver devil showed off the wood box before immediately putting it back into the space. It then turned and left. It was clearly telling her: if you have the ability, come and get it!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I gave you a chance to live, but you didn’t take advantage of it!” harrumphed the Empress Concubine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had believed that the silver devil was a creature that was incapable of thinking. But now it seemed that this fellow was just playing with her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Listen to my order!” the Empress Concubine lifted her hand. Her skirt and long hair fluttered in the windless air and her body slowly rose up as a holy blue halo appeared under her feet!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue halo transformed into an enormous blue ripple in a calm ocean that spread out around her!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everywhere the ripples passed through, the surface of the ground would fissure. Countless monarch rank or higher puppet flower demons appeared from the broken earth, breaking the ground. All of them lined up in front of Chu Mu like enormous nightmarish demon women wearing hair and baring their fangs and claws!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The path in front of Chu Mu was instantly sealed off. If he used Displacement Specter, there was a higher chance he could fall into the flower devouring path!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was going to flee in another direction, but this time, shockingly strong puppet flower demons appeared. He gave a glance, and surprisingly, over a hundred emperor rank flower demon emperors had appeared. They were scattered throughout the vast swathes of the monarch rank puppet flower demon legion. Their tall and graceful bodies began to twist about and their toxic spikes flew like sharp swords in the rain as they charged at Chu Mu!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was surrounded by this army, he would suffer a total defeat. No matter which way Chu Mu moved, countless flower demons would appear around him. There were so many that he wasn’t able to see the sunlight through them. Their thick branches were rampant. They twisted about, resembling dancing snakes that raced towards Chu Mu’s body as if he was their prey!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fairy Butterflies originally scattered through the air had now been completely swallowed. There probably wouldn’t even be one survivor!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his previous fights, Chu Mu had rarely encountered flower type soul pets. Thus, he had always been under the assumption that their attacks were very weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in this dominator rank fight, as he looked at the endless demon flower forest, he was truly able to realize that after the flower type reached the dominator rank, how terrifying it could become!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s silver devil flames didn’t stop burning. The dust under his feet was continuing to pile up!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, even if the defector young woman didn’t use her Flower Throat technique, Chu Mu would also fall into the devouring path of the plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a perimeter of five kilometers, almost everything was occupied by flower demons. Occasionally, there would be a silver devil flame that rose up and all of the plants in the area would be annihilated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These five kilometers could be considered Chu Mu’s range of safety. The might of his devil flames ensured that within the five kilometers, no matter how many puppet flower demons appeared, they would die!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the puppet flower demons were endless, and Chu Mu’s range of safety gradually decreased, becoming four kilometers!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the four kilometers, the rate of Chu Mu’s techniques turned this black flower demon world into an enormous ball of silver fire. This ball of devil flames burned all of the nearby plants to ashes, but the endless wave of plant flower demons gradually pressed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If this continues, even if my physical strength isn’t depleted, I’ll be bound to death.” Chu Mu’s heart sank. He looked up and stared at the defector young woman quietly standing on a flower demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The defector young woman’s cold eyes were looking down on him. All of the plants were listening to her orders and at this height, her imposing nature caused her to look like a flower queen that controlled all creatures. Anything that opposed her would be mercilessly destroyed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A flower type dominator with extremely terrifying attacks!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether she had showed her full strength, Chu Mu wasn’t sure. But at least in Xiang Rong City, Chu Mu could not fight equally against her!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching his devil flame domain continuously shrink, Chu Mu’s heart turned heavy!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The defector woman’s strength had far surpassed his imagination. The blind old man stopping him from taking action had indeed been a wise thing. However, right now, the waves of puppet flower demons were about to practically swallow him up. The moment his demon flame domain disappeared, countless flower type techniques would all strike him. His defenses were not capable of stopping the tens of thousands of attacks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had experienced the strength of a half devil and finally found this woman. However, he was unable to do anything in this endless flower demon sea. This made him very unreconciled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu clenched his hands and forcibly attracted a spatial wind storm into this world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Chu Mu used the spatial wind storm in his own domain. In other words, he would also be struck by the spatial wind storm’s chaotic attacks!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in order to escape this extremely terrifying flower demon forest, Chu Mu had to do this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hu hu hu hu hu!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spatial wind storm mercilessly ripped at everything, tearing the interweaving and closely packed flower demon legion to shreds. Flower petals turned to powder and stems were chopped off while roots were torn out of the ground…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It flew everywhere as the entire southern city was piled up with blue colored corpses that reached a mountain high!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the chaotic energy, the silver bodied Chu Mu slightly swayed. The devil flames on his body showed signs of slightly dimming!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thousands of enemies had been injured. If he didn’t control this spatial wind storm properly, he would be struck by a destructive attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue sky and radiant sun reappeared. The feeling of suppressing suffocation from falling into the flower demon nation had made Chu Mu feel deep fear. If it wasn’t because he had the attribute advantage, a normal dominator rank would have already lost its life in the defector young woman’s territory!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How stubborn!” when the Empress Concubine saw the spatial wind storm appear, she floated far away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her defensive abilities were not strong. If she fell into the spatial wind storm, she would definitely be heavily injured!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blue branches began wildly growing out of the ground. Looking down from the air, it seemed that another blue sea had arisen in the northern side of the city. It was endless, making it seem as though one had entered the deepest part of a primitive forest!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu attempted to leave the city.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His path in front had been heavily sealed again. A feeling of powerlessness manifested.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a familiar nightmarish cry rang out from the horizon!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. He stared past the rapidly growing branches at the horizon blocked by plants.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“First White!” Chu Mu was very happy in his heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one flying over from the horizon was the Nightmare Ruler that insisted on following Chu Mu!&nbsp;</span></p>
