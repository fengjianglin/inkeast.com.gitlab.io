  <div class="paragraph">
   “Ah!!”
   <p></p>
   <p>A wretched scream reverberated throughout the valley once more. The conspicuous fresh blood spilled onto the valley’s green moss, making it particularly striking.</p>
   <p>The Multi Colored Devil Tiger seemed to have not recklessly killed like this in a long time. After biting off Shang Shi’s neck, it instantly pounced towards Shang Shi’s other two soul pets- who now had severed soul pacts.</p>
   <p>Immediately, fresh blood splattered everywhere, and the howls of beasts incessantly rang out. Without Shang Shi’s instructions, the other two soul pets could not withstand even one strike. They were torn to shreds by the Multi Colored Devil Tiger. The blood stained soul cores were directly swallowed into the Multi Colored Devil Tiger’s throat.</p>
   <p>Nearby, Chu Mu looked at the injury riddled Yang Jingli. Looking at his dying gasps, a savage and cruel smile surfaced onto Chu Mu’s face. He then used one foot to ruthlessly step on his cheek.</p>
   <p>"You’ll be stepped under my foot for life, I think that's what you said. Now, you've been stepped under my foot. How does it feel?"</p>
   <p>“If you have the ability… then.. then kill me. On… on this Prison Island… don’t even think about… don’t even think about surviving!” There was blood in Yang Jingli’s mouth as he spoke.</p>
   <p>“Do you know why I would appear on Prison Island?” Chu Mu stared at Yang Jingli and indifferently spoke.</p>
   <p>Indignance riddled in Yang Jingli’s eyes. Anything further would be a disgrace because even he didn’t think he would be defeated by Wangluo City’s biggest joke!</p>
   <p>“I came to this island to slaughter everyone. Don’t worry, it’s futile for a single person from your Yang Family to escape!!” Chu Mu’s expression instantly turned cold.</p>
   <p>Hearing Chu Mu’s unceasingly cold words, Yang Jingli finally felt Chu Mu’s difference from the past- his mercilessness and desire to kill!!</p>
   <p>Mo Xie didn’t need Chu Mu’s explicit order to understand her master’s thoughts.</p>
   <p>“Shua!!”</p>
   <p>The eminently sharp claws quickly slashed apart Yang Jingli’s neck. Instantly, blood poured out, and the humiliation and anger filling Yang Jingli’s eyes died with him!</p>
   <p>Chu Mu had never forsaken the value of a corpse. He swiftly searched through Yang Jingli’s bag. However, there weren’t any valuable items on Yang Jingli. Clearly, because of this fellows young age, the Yang Family didn’t give him any good items.</p>
   <p>“Hou”</p>
   <p>Some unknown time ago, the Multi Colored Devil Tiger stained with blood had walked over in front of Chu Mu. Its two, dark colored eyes gazed at Chu Mu, making his heart palpitate.</p>
   <p>The Multi Colored Devil Tiger swung its head and spat out a finger.</p>
   <p>The finger the Multi Colored Devil Tiger spat out was naturally Shang Shi’s. What made Chu Mu surprised was that there was a spatial ring on the finger.</p>
   <p>“His items all belong to me?” Chu Mu looked at the Multi Colored Devil Tiger and asked.</p>
   <p>“Hou~” The Multi Colored Devil Tiger nodded its head; nevertheless, it arrogantly turned its head and jumped into the precipitous valley. Its figure quickly disappeared from Chu Mu’s field of view.</p>
   <p>Seeing the mighty and aloof Multi Colored Devil Tiger leave, Chu Mu felt a twang of regret. In his heart, he thought: If I had a soul pet like the Multi Colored Devil Tiger, becoming that sole survivor shouldn’t be too much of a problem.</p>
   <p>Shaking his head, Chu Mu also knew that this wasn’t very practical. In reality, as long as Mo Xie had another species mutation, her strength probably wouldn’t be much less that the Multi Colored Devil Tiger. However, it was unknown when Mo Xie’s next species mutation would occur.</p>
   <p>There were differences between spatial rings and soul pet rings. Soul pet rings were spaces that weren’t too stable. They could hold soul pets, but if the soul pet’s strength was too much, the soul pet could use its strength to shatter the soul pet space.</p>
   <p>Equivalently, the soul pet space of soul pet trainers weren’t too stable either. If a soul pet’s strength far surpassed a soul pet trainer, even with a soul pact, trying to chant the recall incantation to lock the soul pet into the soul pet space was of no avail. They could still use their strength to break the restrictions of the soul pet space.</p>
   <p>Soul pet spaces were not actual spaces. They didn’t exactly have a set dimension, and they instead were created according to a soul pet’s build and soul power.</p>
   <p>However, the spaces inside spatial rings were actual spaces. They could be used to store goods. If a spatial ring was large enough, it wouldn’t be an issue to store soul pets.</p>
   <p>Shang Shi’s spatial ring wasn’t that large; it could hold approximately one cubic meter. In reality, one cubic meter could hold many items. Moreover, its market price was one thousand gold coins.</p>
   <p>“Soul armor! This fellow had such a treasure on him!”</p>
   <p>When Chu Mu took out the first item from the spatial ring, he immediately revealed a rapt expression.</p>
   <p>Soul armor was equipment for soul pet trainers and soul pets. Using the soul pet trainer’s Soul Remembrance, a special defensive armor could be created. When attacked, just by using a mental transmission, the soul armor would instantly appear on the body and would be used only for defense.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu had come from a large family, and he naturally knew a lot. From Shang Shi’s spatial ring, the soul armor he found was a fourth level soul armor. Its defensive capabilities were equivalent to a soul pet’s fourth stage defensive skin.</p>
   <p>(TL: Pretty sure there’s a typo. The raws I have state that the soul armor was found in Yang Jingli’s bag. Fairly certain that’s wrong)</p>
   <p>The shape of a soul armor could be changed using soul remembrance. It didn’t have any weight, and didn’t have any physiological restrictions. Thus, it could be considered a luxury good amongst soul pet trainers. Chu Mu never expected that Shang Shi’s spatial ring would contain such a treasure!</p>
   <p>“This item is worth at least a hundred thousand gold coins. Shang Shi himself wasn’t wearing it, so this item’s origins are slightly sketchy.”</p>
   <p>It was very easy to use a soul armor. One only had to pour his or her soul remembrance into it, and the energy crystals within the soul armor would establish a mental connection. The soul armor would then automatically integrate into one’s soul. Once danger arrived, with a single mental transmission, the soul armor would instantly appear. Equipped with this soul armor, Chu Mu now had even better life insurance!</p>
   <p>It seemed like these items that the Yang Family had this time when they came to Prison Island ended up increasing Chu Mu’s chance at surviving.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu didn’t hesitate to pour his soul remembrance into the soul armor. Quickly, he fused the soul armor with his soul remembrance.</p>
   <p>Summoning the soul armor only required an extremely small amount of soul power. Chu Mu impatiently called out his new battle armor!</p>
   <p>A deep, starlike shimmering patterned item revolved around Chu Mu’s body. After Chu Mu used his soul remembrance to control it, the specks condensed together. It hadn’t even reached a second before an azure translucent light armor covered Chu Mu’s body, making him exude a much more imposing aura!</p>
   <p>“Wuwuwu” Mo Xie squinted her beautiful eyes and somewhat excitedly howled at the newly equipped Chu Mu.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu pinched Mo Xie’s fluffy ears and said: “Soul pets also have soul armor. Perhaps other Yang Family people will happen to have beast type soul armor.”</p>
