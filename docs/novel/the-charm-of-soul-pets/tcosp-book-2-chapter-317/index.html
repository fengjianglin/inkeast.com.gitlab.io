 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The woman faintly laughed and nodded her head. Her clothes were luxurious and beside her were a few servant girl like young women. Compared to the young women beside her, this mature woman was more noble and elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was probably the case that when many men saw this woman, they wouldn't focus on her face. Instead they would be attracted by her warm and calm demeanor.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This family servant quickly ran over and said: “Young master, this person is called Chu Chen. He has a zero rank title and isn't occupying any position…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zero rank title?” The young man revealed a rather puzzled expression.</span></p>

These members ostensibly didn't have any authority, and could only be considered part of Soul Palace in name and only served Soul Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, every soul pet trainer that entered Soul Palace would try his or her hardest to obtain a first rank title. After all, the first rank didn’t require too many years to prepare for for a spirit soldier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He could be a new member that just entered Soul Palace. He could also be the some of someone. Don’t pay too much attention to the rank.” said the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It could also be that someone sent him to come here.” the young man’s train of thought was rather rebellious, and he didn’t really believe that a twenty or so year old Chu Mu could obtain a monarch rank soul pet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman had perhaps considered this question before, but she clearly didn’t like to casually assuming other people’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, she would quickly be able to determine if the man in front of had captured the low class monarch soul pet himself because his fight was just about to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

It was merely an extremely large empty space that was surrounded by protective nets around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s opponent stood twenty meters away from him. There were no special privileges in this competition and no matter how strong the person was, he or she had to participate in every round. If the one’s luck was bad, even if one had strength within the top thirty, it was still possible to lose and be eliminated in the first round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the competition officiators had taken note of this and naturally had split up those experts which they knew had potential to go far in order to prevent two experts fighting each other in the early rounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t belong to the group of experts known to the officiators and he was randomly assigned a group. It was presumable that he would encounter some expert in this first round, or perhaps it would be in the fourth round...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s opponent was a thirty year old or so man. His face was large and he was wearing clothing that corresponded with most soul pet trainers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this soul pet trainer saw Chu Mu, the corners of his mouth rose up into a smirk. Even without saying anything, people were able to guess that his face had ‘not bad luck’ written over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since this was a competition that didn’t divide age, a young man participating in the fight would definitely be at a disadvantage. Therefore, young people normally didn’t attend such competitions. Even if the young person did attend, it was only to train him or herself, and he or she wouldn’t have intentions of obtaining a ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young generation members were amongst the minority of people and being able to encounter a young person who was about twenty really was extremely fortuitous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Summon your soul pet.” the main ref used soul remembrance to yell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Summon your soul pet.” the assistant refs standing on either end of the battlefield repeated the command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a conventional competition, either side would simultaneously summon one soul pet each so the problem of attribute countering would be left to chance...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu chanted an incantation at the same time as his opponent. The coiling halo of soul pacts gradually formed two soul pet patterns, summoning the soul pets connected to either soul pet trainer’s soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the main ref indicated that the competition had begun, neither side could attack. Therefore, the first soul pet summoning didn’t need to be a competition of speed and both sides could take their time summoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was presently fighting under the identity of Chu Chen, so the White Nightmare and Mo Xie definitely couldn’t participate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now as the phases and stages of Chu Mu’s soul pets rose, he didn’t have to have Mo Xie or the White Nightmare fight every battle. As long as he stayed in control of the fight, his other soul pets could exhibit fighting strength even powerful than these two soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first soul pet Chu Mu summoned was the Night Thunder Dream Beast that had extreme speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dark aura slowly permeated the battlefield. A constructed shadow full of symbolic representation enveloped half the battlefield. The Night Thunder Dream Beast was silently standing in the shadows and the only thing that made its presence known were the white feathers that flowed from its back down to its tail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister, what soul pet is that?” the young man used a soft soul remembrance. He was simply unable to see through the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s concealment, and was a bit surprised as he asked a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Dream Beast. It’s a darkness attribute Dream Beast.” the woman’s expression didn’t change as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many demons possessed the ability to hide and feign. With Chu Mu’s demon currently standing in the shadows, people without strong perception abilities could only approximately judge its phase and stage. Trying to determine its fighting strength rank from its reserved aura was a bit hard for these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the Night Thunder Dream Beast was a high class commander and, as long as one knew its name, he or she would be able to guess that its fighting strength would not be low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I remember. A few days ago when I was returning to the city, there was a fellow riding on a black Dream Beast that unbridledly overtook my group of Star Wilderness Devil Colts. So it’s him!” said the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Was it very fast?” asked the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was very fast. Only, it didn’t seem to be at the eighth phase. The opposing fellow summoned an eighth phase Evil Flame Demon which has both the attribute and phase advantage.” the young man quickly saw through the Evil Flame Demon which hadn’t hidden its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eighth phase fifth stage. It should have undergone a bit of strengthening.” the woman’s deduction was even more accurate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to fight out something like this… I already said that he’s only a few years older than me so participating in a competition like this is practically seeking self embarrassment…” sighed the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Training oneself isn’t a bad thing. Compared to other young people, his Night Thunder Dream Beast is already very strong.” the woman spoke still very conservatively. Of course, within this conservativism, another meaning was expressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An eighth phase fifth stage, low class commander, Evil Flame Demon. The moment the fight started, Chu Mu couldn’t help but crease his eyebrows. The dark attribute was countered by the fire attribute to a certain extend so if the Night Thunder Dream Beast was hit by the opponent’s fire type technique, it would suffer a serious wound.</span></p>

Young people really are stubborn!” laughed Jia Yingcheng. He immediately gave his Evil Flame Demon an order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two graceful flames fluttered through the air like long pieces of captivating red silk. They interweaved with each other to form a helix, carrying raging flames as they swept towards Chu Mu’s Night Thunder Dream Beast.</span></p>

The beautiful flames didn’t seem to be strong, but they had a special attribute that allowed them to continue chasing the enemy. Without an effective technique to dispel the flames, the two long silk-like flames would fly to the opponent and burn it with fire.</span></p>

Indeed, middle aged soul pet trainers weren’t easy to deal with. From the moment the fight started, this could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Double Satin Flames had already drifted over and the shadows the Night Thunder Dream Beast was standing in were illuminated by the firelight. It was hard for it to continue to keep up its hidden existence and facing this Double Satin Flame that perpetually danced around it, it could only agiley move its body in attempts to dodge.</span></p>

They didn’t move quickly but they perpetually followed behind the Night Thunder Dream Beast. With the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s doding abilities and speed, the two satin flames couldn’t hit it; however, the flames would last for a period of time and in the fight, the Night Thunder Dream Beast would be restricted to a certain extent.</span></p>

The evil flame aura began to proliferate and the air even became scorching hot.</span></p>

If this high temperature technique struck the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s body, due to its low defense, it would easily be heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Chu Mu could only have the Night Thunder Dream Beast continuously dodge the Evil Flame Demon’s techniques whilst searching for an opportunity to defeat the opponent’s soul pet.</span></p>

If it were my soul pets, three of them added together perhaps may not even be able to touch a single hair on this Night Thunder Dream Beast…” said the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhm.” the woman didn’t add any commentary. Her two taciturn and bright eyes were continuously focused on Chu Mu’s Night Thunder Dream Beast. She looked extremely serious, and from time to time would reveal expressions of contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, it is still extremely hard for him to win.” the young man ultimately still gave his own judgement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman still didn’t speak. In truth, she previously had the same opinion as the young man and felt that it would be exceptionally hard for the man called Chu Chen to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when she gradually began to focus on the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s dodging she felt that it was giving off an feeling of perpetual readiness. She indistinctly felt that it wasn’t merely doing something as simple as just passively dodging...</span></p>
