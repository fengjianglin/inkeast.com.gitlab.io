 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xu’s clan was already eager to act. Five days before the battle, Li Xu stood at the top of heavenly mountain and told his subordinates, “Look to the west of you. It will become a land of slaves. I shouldn’t need to tell you how to treat slaves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Ground initially couldn’t enter Li Xu’s eyes. However, adventurers constantly coming to report to him kept saying New Moon Ground had many secrets that were hidden. Three palaces had sacred realms, immortal city, sealed tower, and other independent spaces that were all very rare outside of here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were actually very few independent spaces outside, yet a small third rank realm had over ten of them. This meant that this territory wasn’t as simple as they first thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So, after understanding the situation, Li Xu was even more eager to take over this land. He was already regretting not sending people over sooner, wasting a huge resource here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it didn’t matter. After the battle, these people would still become slaves. Then, New Moon Ground would permanently become cloud realm’s resource source. If these independent spaces had more room for excavation, cloud realm may even enter eighth rank realm soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they reached eighth rank realm, cloud realm would finally have a real say in the entire territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xu already had the future development planned. Because of this, he specially old the army’s power to station themselves in western region. This way, the moment this battle finished, they could become the ruler and start his master plan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t that he underestimated Chu Mu’s strength, but their origins were simply too different. How would the great Li Family ever need to be afraid of people from a third rank realm? It was like a great city master being afraid of a random mountain village monk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed slowly. When the independence battle day arrived, the red sun slowly lifted into the sky amongst clouds as Li Xu brought his experts to the top of heavenly mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly mountain’s mountains lifted up like towering screens, solemnly standing in this snow white world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first rays of sunlight fell down, dying the white carpet a brilliant gold. The dazzling scene caused everyone to be shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Climbing to the peak, the coldness was already going deep into their souls. Even the spirit emperor ranks were shivering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The location of the battle was set early on by Divine Sect members. North of cloud gate was a large group of rolling white mountains. Spectators could all watch on the main peak, while the participants could fight in the endless mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the icy mountain, a green robed main judge Lu Yuqin was already standing silently and alone at the top of the peak. She was slim but attractive- her coldness very similar to the nearby ice mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maybe, in many experts’ hearts, this icy woman was far more piercingly cold than all the heavenly mountains combined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silently staring at the icy world for a while. Lu Yuqin seemed zoned out. When she turned back around, she noticed that New Moon Ground and Li Xu’s participants were all twenty meters behind her. No one dared to come up and disturb her thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maintaining this distance with others was something Lu Yuqin was already used to. Her gaze fell on New Moon Ground’s people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first that caught Lu Yuqin’s attention was Bai Yu in a black coat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yuqin was very confused. This man seemed very young, but his manners and expression were all overly mature, if not upright old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu had just finished a difficult training session, so he hadn’t completely suppressed the devil flames within him. He oozed evil influences still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the half human type devil man?” Lu Yuqin felt the burning flames within Bai Yu and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half human type was only a saying from Divine Sect. There were countless weird things in the world. The so called other type was only the term referring to special creatures created between a human and soul pet soul. These other type organisms were mentioned in Divine Sect books but weren’t truly common.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu nodded. There was no in point denying it. He left a deep impression on everyone in Devil Soul Mountains and Wen City. Lu Yiqin could probably guess it was him regardless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yuqin nodded and didn’t ask anymore, having her gaze fall on Liu Binglan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her gaze fell on Liu Binglan for a long time. Liu Binglan was wearing a long white robe. The elegant fur on the robe adorned her soft figure well. Mature, at ease, elegant- her cold yet beautiful face instantly attracted many peoples’ gazes, including Lu Yuqin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yuqin stared at Liu Binglan for two reasons. The first was because she felt a familiar character from this woman. The aura was similar to her, a woman that was devoid of desire and gained an atmosphere that came with being in a position of authority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Lu Yuqin could tell that she wasn’t completely devoid of desires. At least, from what she could tell, she was already a mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second reason was because of this woman’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes were glinting purple. All humans in New Moon Ground had black pupils. This meant they were normal human subspecies. Using a soul pet’s species rank, it meant they were warrior rank humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What caused Lu Yuqin to be confused was the New Moon Ground three palace’s female supreme was a human royal species with her pupils filled with purple glow, meaning her bloodline was the purest purple pupil royal family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yuqin didn’t say anything but watched her for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, she noticed the ring on Liu BInglan’s ring finger. That ring seemed familliar to Lu Yuqin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did someone give that ring to you?” Lu Yuqin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan looked at the ring she wore and was wondering why Lu Yuqin asked this out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ring wasn’t anything special. It was just something that Chu Tianmang gave her when they were together early on. It was a special jade stone that allowed her to sense his location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This jade stone was something Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi also had. Liu Binglan saw it before. However, since some time, her jade stone stopped working. No matter how much spirit remembrance she put into it, she could no longer find Chu Tianmang’s presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan wore it not because she missed the man so much. She wore it simply to tell some people to step aside because it signified that she was married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t reply, but Liu Binglan was smart enough to realize that Lu Yuqin would only ask that because she had met Chu Tianmang before, since he had a similar ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yuqin saw that she didn’t want to respond and didn’t follow up. Instead, she glanced at everyone else and said, “Chu Mu isn’t here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s on the way.” Liu BInglan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan told Ye Qingzi to wait in Wanxiang City and come with Chu Mu. Ye Qingzi could sense Chu Mu’s position, so Liu Binglan knew that Chu Mu was already on his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The time has been set. If he doesn’t appear, it counts as an automatic failure. If you two are sub realm masters, you should take the challenge from the cloud realm realm masters first.” Lu Yuqin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s the first to fight?” Lu Yuqin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan and Bai Yu glanced at each other and Bai Yu spoke first, “Let me go first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Prince Chao, Ye Wansheng, Teng Lang, and Shen Mo all spoke, “Bai Yu, it’s all up to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu remained cool. He stepped through space, and towards the endless mountains that were his battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spectral Jin Rou stood behind Mu Qingyi watching her father step forth, not feeling great.</span></p>

However, because of her, everyone had to deal with it so hastily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, her father Bai Yu was going to battle, facing the experts from Cloud Realm that were far stronger and larger than Wanxiang City. Seeing him go forth without any hesitation, it seemed as if anything related to her would cause him to step forth without any complaint…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she watched, an aching arose in her heart.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I heard that during the struggle for devil souls in Guangtong Bewildering World, a great many dominator ranks attacked him all at once yet over half were killed by him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why does he seem no different than us normal people?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The changes in New Moon Ground’s structure also never seemed to be separate from this man. Two half devil incidents both marked a change in era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, this half devil Bai Yu that once caused the world to fear was no longer the person everyone blanched at the mention of. Instead, he was slowly becoming the second most respected expert of New Moon Ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, this respected yet scary half devil Bai Yu was coming to fight for New Moon Ground’s independence. Whether he won or lost today sealed New Moon Ground’s fate for the next few thousand years, starting a new chapter in history. Whether it’s independence or being enslaved was up to this nightmare emperor.</span></p>
