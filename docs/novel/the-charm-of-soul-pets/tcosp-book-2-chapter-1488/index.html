 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Follow me,” Elder Li turned and slowly walked towards the back of the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Ning Maner followed the short raccoon and entered a dark wooden room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some unique gems laid out within the wooden room glowing softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many vine tables were set up within the room, various wooden flasks were placed on top of those tables. They all had different colors and shapes. The entire room looked just like a mini pharmacy. Chu Mu remembered that Ye Qingzi’s table was also mostly occupied by such flasks occasionally, just that Ye Qingzi’s table was much neater than Elder Li’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are a Soul Teacher?” asked Chu Mu a little surprise mixed in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you were to categorize me based on a human’s standards, that would be correct,” Elder Li nodded and continued, “You humans have your own civilization, us demons have our own civilization. It's not only the humans who understand how to make Soul Items, Xuan Items, and Immortal Items......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Li spoke calmly as if that was completely normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was a shocking fact to Chu Mu nonetheless. He could imagine that most of the humans would open their mouths wide in shock after finding out that other races also had talents like the Soul Teachers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I had told you to come five years later because the medicine to remove the corpse property is not really that easy to concoct. The East Ocean is also now in a turmoil and my subordinates sadly cannot harvest the herb. I’m still missing one herb, now that you’re here already, help me run an errand,” said Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No problem,” Chu Mu readily nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t accept it so readily. This herb is not that easy to find. The place that it grows is within the battlefield between the Calamity Ocean Demon and the other ocean rulers,” continued Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu would have to find it no matter how difficult it was going to be, since it was related to Night’s life itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you have any water type soul pet with you?” asked Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu scratched his head awkwardly. He could not swim at all. Everytime he ventured into the Eternal Ocean, he would feel really insecure as he had not yet been able to obtain a water type soul pet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Li could easily tell the truth from Chu Mu’s expression, “It would be more troublesome if that's the case. Life Providence Grass grows rather deep within the ocean trenches. Although I know where you can find one, you won’t actually be able to obtain this Immortal Item without diving deep into the ocean.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could only laugh bitterly. What should he do now? Should he go and catch a water type soul pet just for this special occasion? Even though he did have empty slots in his soul contract, he did not really want to just randomly make a soul pact with a soul pet. His choice of soul pet was very strict!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Li, I have a friend. She’s currently in a specter state, and her body is also well preserved. Is there any way to resurrect her?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The matter related to Princess Jin Rou has always bothered Chu Mu. However, resurrection was truly as vague as the legends told. Chu Mu did not know of any way to search for it. Since Elder Li was more knowledgeable than Old Li and could recover a soul pet from a corpse state back to a demon, it might just be able to resurrect Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can tell me the actual situation she is in. How she died, the time that she died, as well as the reason that she is in her current state,” said Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu told Elder Li the entire situation without any deception mixed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She has already died for such a long time......” Elder Li stroked its silver beard and began thinking, “But fortunately, you have preserved her body well and have already awakened her soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there a way to resurrect her?” Chu Mu heard Elder Li’s tone and became excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Resurrection is actually a subjective matter. You cannot really expect a dead person with a rotten corpse to be resurrected, nor can you resurrect a person whose soul has already been vanquished. As for your friend’s situation, first, you have preserved her body well, and you also used the Immortal Spring Water. This initial action has preserved some of the activeness of her body. Then, she has also signed a soul contract with the devil soul and awakened her soul. This has allowed her chances at resurrection to increase. I have a method that may be able to resurrect her, but I have no absolute confidence in it. Other than this method, the Limbo Flower’s resurrection technique can resurrect her,” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had already heard about the Limbo Flower’s resurrection technique from Old Li before. However, it was not really easy to find the Limbo Flower. Bai Yu had been searching for this clue for so many years and there was no actual result in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the one holding the highest racial rank amongst the Five Great Undying Legends, Limbo Flower had a much scarcer population than the other four. It was rumored that only a single person possessed a Limbo Flower. Also, it was hard to tell what rank that Limbo Flower was and whether it really possessed the resurrection technique which could actually work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless Chu Mu could intrude into the Flower Species territory and find that Undying Limbo from amongst the many Flower Species.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was clearly an impossible task. Leaving aside whether he could meet the Undying Limbo, just finding the location of the Flower Species territory was already a problem in itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dispelling Night’s corpse state requires a Life Providence Grass. Your friend also needs this herb. However, don’t get your expectations up yet, because an Immortal Item that can reunite the soul and the body is not so easily created,” reminded Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine as long as there's a possibility,” Chu Mu nodded. Even if the chance was only one in a thousand, he would definitely try to resurrect her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then your herb picking difficulty will also greatly increase. The Life Providence Grass that I wanted you to fetch is one thousand years old, within the underwater abyss at the ocean trench. Your friend requires at least a three thousand years old Life Providence Grass. There may be one at the bottom of the underwater abyss. You can take a look there if you have the ability to. As for how to go underwater, you need to think about that one yourself,” said Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of this problem, Chu Mu began to feel a headache once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice and water were both a bane to fire. Within the water, his spatial ability would also be restricted to some extent. This weakening of his strength was quite a significant factor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother cannot really swim. Grandpa Li, can you help big brother out?” Ning Maner blinked her eyes and used a coquettish tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh......” Elder Li was already helping Chu Mu with concocting the medicine. This task of picking the herb should be Chu Mu’s own responsibility. It was up to his own ability whether he could obtain it or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, with Ning Maner pleading in Chu Mu's stead, Elder Li softened a little. That human did not really own any water type soul pet and had fire property himself on top of that. He could not really exhibit his strength underwater, so it would be too heartless to make him run such an errand all by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine, go look for the East Ocean Siren King. It owes me a little favor, tell it that I told you to look for it. It will help you,” said Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">East Ocean Siren King?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time that Chu Mu heard about such a race. Could it be that the rumor within the navy about the existence of sirens be actually true?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Li seemed to have seen through Chu Mu’s doubt and explained, “The East Ocean of the Eternal Ocean is closer to your human continent. It’s common to have some mixed bloodline there. Ancient Flood Dragon Person also had a little human blood. Furthermore, you are a mixed blood yourself. The so-called mixed bloodline may not necessarily need to be from cross breeding. It’s possible that through some special soul integration or through obtaining the inheritance of another race can mutate the bloodline of a creature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ugh,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Chu Mu went astray. For a moment, Chu Mu was certainly wondering just how two different species could produce an offspring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of which, Chu Mu had immediately thought of another question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one day he and Ye Qingzi had a child, then would that child be similar to him and could also play with fire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that was really the case, then just how difficulty would it be to raise such a child?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Elder Li,” Chu Mu knew that Elder Li had provided him with great assistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm, go. The East Ocean Siren King is a powerful individual in the East Ocean. A growing Monument Tear Individual and the Messiah Tree Guardian like you needs to be acquainted with more racial leaders like that. It will be beneficial to you,” suggested Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa Li, just now you said your Demon Species, does that include the Demon Species that reside on this island? Then, aren’t you also living along with the Ocean Species? They occupy the ocean while you occupy the island?” asked Ning Maner out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the Quiet Forest, Grandfather Messiah Tree would often tell Ning Maner stories of these races. Now that she was actually in the habitat of these Demon Species, she naturally had many questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Li seemed to really like Ning Maner. It smiled like a gentle elderly and patiently started explaining, “Demonic Mound is just one of the territories of our Demon Species. It’s similar to a main city in your human continent. Other than some of the islands on the Eternal Ocean, our Demon Species still has a territory about the same size as your human continent. However, I have not returned there for many years now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, are there only Demon Species living there?” asked Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Li shook its head, “Demon Species only possess a rather prosperous and civilized rulership. There are many other tribes, dynasties and major races there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really want to take a look now......” said Ning Maner enviously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehehe, we will gladly welcome you. Humans do not really understand the importance of the Messiah Tree, but our Demon Species know how to well cherish and protect you. Sigh, it’s just a pity that the last Messiah Tree was destroyed. The masters of the five great races are probably really angry now,” lamented Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s alright, there’s still me,” Ning Maner had already walked out from that sorrowful past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, hopefully, those humans will not make the same mistake again. If they really were to enrage the five great races, then the human territory will truly experience an apocalypse,” said Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They won’t. There are many people like big brother there, they won’t allow those people to do as they like,” said Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu laughed bitterly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t use me in such a big generalization. I’m not a human leader, I’m just a tiny New Moon Land King. There’s no point in talking about something on such a macro scale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The true rulers of humans were the Divine Set, Xuan Gate Immortal School, Demon Beast Palace, Elemental Clan and the others. There was no way that it would be up to him to shoulder the responsibility of the survival of the entire race......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu admitted that he was a rather selfish person. After all, he already found it a problem whether he could protect New Moon Land or not.</span></p>
