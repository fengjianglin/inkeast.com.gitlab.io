 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fengnan’s mouth twitched slightly. The reason he had shown up was not because of Lu Kongtong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A minor character like Lu Kongtong was not qualified enough to receive his attention. It was already an honor that he called Lu Kongtong his cousin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fengnan had already received the report of their arrival from the gatekeepers the moment Ye Qingzi entered Xuan Gate. He had originally wanted to find some of the disciples to harass Ye Qingzi after her meeting with the old madam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What surprised him though was that Ye Qingzi had brought a man with her, and that man was behaving rather arrogantly by beating Lu Kongtong on his turf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was to directly confront Ye Qingzi, then the old madam would definitely be extremely displeased with him. Lu Fengnan was just wondering on how to give Ye Qingzi a warning, and her companion actually brought himself at his doorstep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Asking for a beating? Just how many people would dare to say that to me in the entire Zhengming Main City? I want to see just how you would beat me up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, you can tell me if you don’t want to live anymore. I have many ways to make you suffer a fate worse than death!” threatened the senior disciple Yuan coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Kongtong was elated. He was still worried that his words would not be sufficient enough to provoke both sides. To think that the other party would be so cooperative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You dare to insult the top disciple before everyone! Don’t even think about leaving Xuan Gate alive!” gloated Lu Kongtong in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Yin who was next to Chu Mu was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can there be such a person in the world? He easily admitted it even though it was clear that the other side was provoking him intentionally. Could he be purposely going after the top disciple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But top disciple Lu Fengnan is not so simple, not many who looked for trouble with him could survive so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Top, let us get rid of him. I don’t know where he came from, but how dare he stir trouble in our Xuan Gate,” some high rank disciples immediately stood out and started glaring at Chu Mu in a group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fengnan simply waved his hand to silence the surrounding disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the disciples immediately fell silent. However, they were still glaring angrily at Chu Mu. Insulting Xuan Gate’s top disciple was equivalent to insulting the entire Xuan Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Name yourself first. Then, I will consider if you are qualified enough to speak with me,” stated Lu Fengnan arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu,” answered Chu Mu simply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really dare to state your name! Who the heck is Chu Mu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I have never heard of that name before. Such a nameless person actually dared to provoke our top.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu had just named himself, those disciples immediately began their verbal abuse against him. Curses, belittling and mockeries were all mixed together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not care about any of that. His eyes were calmly watching those Xuan Gate disciples who only knew how to bark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu...... Chu Mu, this name sounds really familiar......” Lan Yin was frowning in deep thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, Lan Yin recalled something and her face was filled with utter astonishment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, you’re...... you’re that......” Lan Yin pointed at Chu Mu in shock and was unable to finish her sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Lu Fengnan’s expression turned dark immediately. The other Xuan Gate disciples might not know who Chu Mu was, but there was no way he would not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The champion of the Outstanding Expert Competition. The one who took on the challenge of all the young experts in the competition venue. He was merciless and had shocked everyone with his ruthless massacre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the second match, he completely overwhelmed Han Erxing using a soul pet that did not even reach the Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the third match, he used a dark type dream beast to defeat the strongest soul pet trainer in the younger generation, Tang Zhuo, and became the champion which caused an uproar in the entire Zhengming Main City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the Xuan Gate disciples who were currently gathered here, some of them had also spectated the competition. However, they were sitting rather far away from the stage and could not clearly see Chu Mu’s appearance. Hence, they did not connect the person who had shown up with the champion of the Outstanding Expert Competition. It was to the point that when Chu Mu named himself, they were unable to react and mocked Chu Mu out of sheer habit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after a while, when they gradually started realizing that this name was not of some nameless person whom they had mocked, but the same name as the recent hot topic, New Moon Land’s King Chu Mu, they no longer dared to mock him anymore......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is...... Is this guy really the champion of the Outstanding Expert Competition, Chu Mu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are there many people called Chu Mu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Luckily I didn’t voice out my opinion just now......” the attitude of those disciples instantly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The senior disciple Yuan’s expression was similarly dark. He had finally understood the reason why that man dared to stir trouble so arrogantly in Xuan Gate. It was because he was Chu Mu, the champion of the Outstanding Expert Competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior disciple Yuan held a high position in Xuan Gate, but he was not even able to enter the top eight participant list in Xuan Gate itself......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you here to tell me that you are my enemy?” Lu Fengnan’s tone also changed, becoming full of hostility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing died. Lu Fengnan had some idea on who had done it. He had met with Han Erxing on that very day, and Snakeman was also introduced by him to Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Snakeman could not be found, and Han Erxing was also killed. This was only possible if the scheme was exposed and the enemy had retaliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Lu Fengnan would harm Ye Qingzi from the dark. Although the schemes were resolved by the people protecting her, he did not receive any form of retaliation from Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time though, when he made a move on people around Chu Mu, Han Erxing was immediately killed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing was the eldest son of Gate Master Han. Killing him was the same as committing a grave crime. Lu Fengnan had never expected Chu Mu to be so ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Erxing died, Lu Fengnan trembled. If he was at the scene that day, then he might also have been killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fengnan held a high position in Zhengming Main City. People like Gate Master Han would also have to be polite towards him. However, his actual strength was probably just on par with Tang Zhuo. He possessed great influence in the entire Zhengming Main City, as well as a high reputation due to his identity as a Xuan Teacher. However, in terms of pure assassination skills, he believed that he would not be able to kill Han Erxing who was protected by Zhao Zhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like fighting, do you dare to have a spar with me?” provoked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu said those words now, the weight behind them had comepletely changed. Nobody dared to doubt whether Chu Mu had such qualifications anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, don’t be too full of yourself. You’re acting so arrogant after obtaining the title of the champion of the Outstanding Expert Competition. Do you really think that you are the strongest person in Zhengming Main City? Our top disciple senior is just unwilling to participate in it,” shouted Lu Kongtong angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, do you dare or do you not?” asked Chu Mu without getting fazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior disciple Yuan was at a loss on how to answer, while Lu Fengnan had an urge to slap that cousin to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leaving aside whether Chu Mu held back or not, just the fact that he had defeated Tang Zhuo meant that Lu Fengnan had seventy percent chance of losing against him in a frontal confrontation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You, the Outstanding Expert Competition champion challenging a mere Xuan Teacher like me, so what if you win?” questioned Lu Fengnan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fengnan knew that Chu Mu was purposely provoking him, he would be in trouble if he were to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I said that you’re asking for a beating. I’m not intending to obtain something by defeating you, but I am rather just trying to beat you up,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s nonchalant words caused Lu Fengnan to draw a deep breath and he almost cursed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So arrogant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, provoking our top disciple senior is the same as provoking our entire Xuan Gate,” said some high rank disciples with indignation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took a glance at those people who were trying to team up against him, then coldly stated, “If you want to be like those corpses on the Hovering Mountain, then go ahead and summon your soul pets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s words turned into a cold wave and slammed onto those disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people who had spectated that battle knew that Chu Mu was a merciless person. There were over a hundred soul pets that had died by his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The average strength of Xuan Gate’s disciples was in reality not that strong. If a battle ensued, would over a hundred of them really be able to put up a fight against Chu Mu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell does this guy want?” cursed Lu Fengnan in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Provoking all of Xuan Gate’s disciples, Chu Mu was a complete lunatic to be able to do something as arrogant as that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Top, let me go. Our Xuan Gate has never suffered such an insult before!” said the senior disciple Yuan furiously as he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he stepped forward, the thirty yellow-robed high rank disciples behind him also stepped forward. Each of them glaring furiously at Chu Mu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Gate’s disciples had always been respected by the other factions. Even between the disciples of the same rank, the other factions would be polite towards them considering the identity of Xuan Teacher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They might not be strong, but their positions were not low. Getting provoked and being threatened by someone was not something that they could tolerate. Furthermore, this place was the territory of their Xuan Gate. If they really lost the courage to fight back here, then their Xuan Gate would completely lose their face when this news spreads out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you like battles so much, our Xuan Gate disciples will go along with you and let you die in satisfaction!” shouted senior disciple Yuan after he walked up to Chu Mu’s front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m here only to beat up Lu Fengnan. If you want to interfere, then you will become a corpse,” Chu Mu sneered in his heart after he saw Lu Fengnan taking a step back at such a timing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Lu Fengnan was rather clever. He stood behind his companions at the right time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not qualified to fight our top. So what if we die!” rebuted senior disciple Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was about to speak when a tall figure suddenly walked over. He stood before the senior disciple Yuan and spoke without reservation, “Dying in the hands of our King will be your honor. Do you think that you are qualified to fight our King?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior disciple Yuan was startled for a moment, then he glared at the sudden intruder angrily, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That tall man ignored senior disciple Yuan and greeted Chu Mu in front of everyone, “I’m Bai Shaoye, a wandering Enforcer under New Moon Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded. He had heard about him from Liu Binglan. Bai Shaoye was an expert that entered the Holy Region in New Moon Land early on but did not show himself often.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m also coincidentally visiting Xuan Gate, but I never thought that King Chu would also be here. Haha, leave these minor characters to me. King Chu can just beat up the person whom you want to beat,” smiled Bai Shaoye.</span></p>
