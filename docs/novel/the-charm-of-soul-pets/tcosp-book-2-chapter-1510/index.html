 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan was curious about what item Wo City’s City Lord had stolen from the royal family, but she didn’t inquire. If he was willing to risk such danger, the object he stole was definitely unordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan remembered that City Lord Lin Xian was trustworthy. She, therefore, figured that the city lord had probably formed some agreement with Yu Suo and when Lin Xian asked her to escort her back to his mountain villa, she nodded her head in agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you walk yourself?” Liu Binglan looked at the weakened Lin Xian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Probably,” Lin Xian had suffered a mental wound, but as long as he didn’t pass out, he probably wouldn’t have much of an issue walking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">City Lord Lin Xian could see that Liu Binglan wasn’t used to lending her arm to others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xian helplessly shook her head: this woman was the same as before. She didn’t like any stranger touching her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Lin Xian was even more confident that if he told her his real identity, her not immediately throwing him off this cliff, let alone lending an arm to him, would mean her temper was way better than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan walked beside him while Lin Xian didn’t say anything. He dragged his tired body forwards, and occasionally threw a glance at her face from the side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite many years having passed, her appearance hadn’t changed much. Perhaps it was because she had entered the spirit emperor and spirit immortal rank at a young age, but Lin Xian had never seen any signs of age on her face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cold beauty, icy arrogance and an unwillingness to talk. Like an icy lotus slowly blossoming, if anyone wanted to approach her, this person would be injured by the icy aura around her…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xian was also silent as he walked forwards. However, his mind was slowly filled with those memories from long ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was late at night and silent out. The servants in the villa were all resting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no one on patrol in the villa since the people living in the villa were the strongest group of people in the human realm. What person would be able to escape their perception?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After passing through the villa, they arrived at Lin Xian’s courtyard. Liu Binglan was planning on leaving, but she faintly creased her brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’ve come again.” Liu Binglan quickly warned Lin Xian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They definitely smelled the blood.” Lin Xian thought back about their trip and realized he’d neglected a serious problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the black clothing on him, hastily took it off and threw it into his spatial ring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking off his black clothing, he only had an unlined garment on. It looked like he had just climbed out of bed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After putting away his clothes, Lin Xian hastily extended his other arm, and placed it next to his mouth before he fiercely bit down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This bite caused blood to spill out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan saw Lin Xian’s action and was somewhat confused. Then, Lin Xian suddenly grabbed ahold of Liu Binglan’s windbreaker and pulled it off onto the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan was stunned. But before she could think any further, the two royal family elders from before passed through to the pavilion and flew into the courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two elders looked suspiciously at Liu Binglan and Lin XIan. They noticed that Lin XIan’s clothing was a bit weird and looked him over for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are the two of you doing so late at night?” one of the royal family elders sternly asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should be asking you this!!” Lin Xian seemed extremely angry and stared at the two elders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re chasing a thief who disappeared nearby… City Lord Lin, Female Supreme Liu, please answer our question.” asked the other royal family elder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you guys think?” Lin Xian sneered and wrapped his arm around Liu Binglan’s waist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two elders were both stunned. After thinking about it, a man and a woman with their jackets on the ground… what else would they be doing at the dead of night?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re sorry for disturbing the two of you. It was because Female Supreme Liu was alone just now and we smelled a stench of blood here.” said the royal family elder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you talking about this?” Lin Xian extended his other hand and showed the serious bite marks to the two royal family experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xian slowly explained: “I was a bit impulsive just now, and did something rude to a beautiful woman… also, she likes to bite.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two royal family elders looked at each other. There were no holes in the words that they could see.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the explanation behind biting, aih… young people liking these stimulating things was normal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people were visitors and intruding into their courtyards and interrupting their happy occasion was extremely rude.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two royal family elders didn’t dare stay longer. They turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t say anything from start to finish. When she used soul remembrance to sense that the two royal family elders were far away, she calmly looked at Lin Xian and said: “Your ability to tell a lie is very high. You’re like an old friend of mine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha.” Lin Xian awkwardly laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can you take your hand off of me?” Liu Binglan’s had turned cold. This was a sign of anger to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry, sorry.” Lin Xian hastily retracted his hand from Liu Binglan’s waist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That arm was wounded, and Lin Xian hadn’t deliberately wanted to take advantage of Liu Binglan. He just wanted to use this method to cover his wound and prevent the two royal family elders from seeing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of which, he had grabbed her waist in the past. Was there really a need to get so angry over a small action?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Goodbye,” Liu Binglan didn’t say anything further to Lin Xian. Since he had safely arrived in his courtyard, her job was finished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks.” Lin Xian watched Liu Binglan turn and leave. When Liu Binglan left, Lin Xian placed his hand next to his cheek and took off his disguise, revealing his original appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched Liu Binglan walk-off, Chu Tianmang helpless shook his head and said: “You’re still so hard to please. Didn’t I just grab your waist?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought of the days he spent with Liu Binglan when he was young, Chu Tianmang couldn’t help but rub his temples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman was unmoved by force or persuasion and was extremely stubborn. You wouldn’t know how to win over her favor or even when you had offended her. Most importantly, she didn’t like to talk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If she didn’t talk, how would Chu Tianmang knew what she was thinking about?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I shouldn’t have gone to Universe Ice Gates back then,” Chu Tianmang muttered to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">… after returning to her room, Liu Binglan changed her clothes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xian’s arm was wounded and the blood on her arms had left a mark on her back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t like to be touched by strangers. This was related to why she was always received pure and tranquil thoughts in Soul Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she felt that something wasn’t right.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xian’s eyes gave Liu Binglan a familiar feeling. It wasn’t a seemingly familiar pair of eyes, but a pair she knew well!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s the spatial survivor saved by Bai Yu.” Liu Binglan was certain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Liu Binglan also felt that this person wasn’t just that. He was also hiding something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for what he was hiding, she couldn’t figure it out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">… on the second day of the conference, all of the representatives and human experts went to their seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seats were still the same as yesterday. Liu Binglan felt a bit uneasy &nbsp;and from the moment she entered the room, she felt a flustered feeling and very uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you sleep well last night?” Madam Huo walked past Liu Binglan’s seat and smiled as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan’s ability to ignore someone was very strong. She couldn’t even be bothered to look at Madam Huo and thought about her own matters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Huo’s eyes turned sharp and she coldly said: “You must have had a good time last night. City Lord Lin is an outstanding man.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan looked up and glanced at Madam Huo before looking at City Lord Lin Xian who had walked past her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xian heard Madam Huo’s words and his steps came to a halt. He glanced over at the two royal family elders sitting high up and smiled as he said: “I thought only the two elders who barged in last night knew about my discussion with Female Supreme Liu about Northern Territory Matters. I’m very curious how Madam Huo knows about this? Could those two elders have spent the rest of the night having a long talk with the gossipy Madam Huo?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Land was a new faction and still needed to fear Elemental Sect Fire Faction’s influence</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, why did Wo City’s City Lord need to fear her? If Madam Huo were to keep insulting people, Chu Tianmang didn’t mind summoning Darkness Sect people to cripple Madam Huo’s soul remembrance before throwing her to the lowest level of the lowest-grade brothel and have her use her noble body to service those lowly men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Huo was speechless towards Lin Xian’s words. The surrounding faction representatives all looked over with interest. They wanted to know whether those two proud royal family elders had actually spent the rest of the night “talking” with Madam Huo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the relationship between Wo City City Lord Lin Xian and New Moon Land Female Supreme Liu, there were already rumors of them sleeping together. The two of them had come together to Dual Earth Mountain so who wouldn’t be able to guess that there was something between them? Moreover, City Lord Lin Xian had directly admitted it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Huo knew she had lost this round, and she scathingly glared at Liu Binglan before quickly returning to her seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Madam Huo was chased away, Liu Binglan used a mental voice to say to Lin Xian: “City Lord Lin, please watch your words. I have a husband, and I am a mother.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that’s fine. I don’t mind.” Lin Xian shamelessly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, while the words Liu Binglan used to reject suitors and maintain her reputation had some effect on others, they were nothing to Chu Tianmang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had a husband? Wasn’t the husband Chu Tianmang himself? Although they had been separated for many years, they never actually talked about a divorce.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I care,” Liu Binglan said very frankly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, then I’ll clarify things.” said Lin Xian. At this moment, he suddenly thought of something and asked: “Is there something between you and Magistrate Xiao…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My daughter in law saved his father’s life.” coldly said Liu Binglan. She was a bit unhappy Lin Xian asked about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, ok. I’ll try my best to help your New Moon Land in this conference,” said Lin Xian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll thank you first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he mentioned the conference, Liu Binglan felt anxious again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with Wo City willing to stand on New Moon Land’s side, that was only a few more votes. It would still be difficult to change the actual situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
