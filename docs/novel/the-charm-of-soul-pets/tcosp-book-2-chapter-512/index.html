With the powerful support of Wood Tray Spirit and Water Moon, Mo Xie could easily deal with even three top tier commander ranks!</span></p>

Under the effects of the nine majestic tails’ Nine Tail Dragon Obliteration, it completely lost all of its fighting strength. The eighth rank prisoner couldn’t do anything but clench his teeth and retract his soul pet!</span></p>

Beforehand, the disheveled leader thought he could handle Chu Mu alone. However, as the battle continued, more than a half of the twenty-some soul pets had died, of which a few seventh rank prisoner died under the savage attacks of the three soul pets as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, the only thing they could truly rely on was the four top tier commander ranks.</span></p>

The disheveled leader turned around to immediately find an eighth rank prisoner fallen on the floor, his hand separated from his body, shooting blood out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside this prisoner, the top tier commander rank that War Court Black Beast originally fought with had fallen on the floor. A deep gash cut this top tier commander rank from neck to hip!</span></p>

Its muscles and bones slowly dissolved into black blood that oozed out of the wound!</span></p>

Three top tier commander ranks were killed, and the remaining three commander ranks couldn’t possibly match up!!</span></p>

We’ve fought against them for so long, yet none of his soul pets are heavily injured!” The other eighth rank prisoner’s tone became very weak, without any fighting intent anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prisoners had a total of twenty one soul pets. The terrifying Thirteen Inferno Hells fell down and killed four while heavily wounding three. One technique caused them to lose seven soul pets. Three of their wing type soul pets were restricted by Ting Lan, while the rest of the eleven soul pets were all wounded to a certain extent. This caused many to instantly be killed by Mo Xie and the mysterious War Court Black Beast!</span></p>

However, as the amount of soul pets continued to decrease, and with seventh rank prisoners constantly being killed, they were slowly becoming utterly defeated!</span></p>

He originally wanted to fight even while he was wounded. After all, the prisoners had a numbers advantage. However, when he arrived there, the battlefield’s situation no longer needed him. His mission changed to dealing with the escaping seventh rank prisoner that lost two soul pets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle in the air with Ting Lan neared completion too. Two of the three wing type soul pets had their wings snapped by her soul pet.</span></p>

She watched Chu Mu, a man that was cold and apathetic as he darted through between these prisoners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining two top tier commander ranks could no longer cause any obstruction to the ultimately swift Mo Xie. Now was the time for Mo Xie to kill!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A total of twelve seventh rank prisoners. Just as Chu Mu said, Chu Mu didn’t view these prisoners as people. No matter if they were fallen on the ground or still riding wounded soul pets, whenever Chu Mu and the Nine Tail Inferno Fox appeared, a prisoner would face a miserable death under its savage claws!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!!!!! Ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Screams rang through everyone’s ears. Not long ago, the prisoners’ malevolent and wicked laughs were still echoing beside her ears, almost causing her to lose her reason. However, now, these prisoners got their deserved punishment, all slowly accepting their deaths in terror as their torturous laughter became frightening screams!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And this all was because of the man who had completely released his killing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before seventh realm, TIng Lan always thought Chu Mu’s strength was at most similar to herself and Shang Heng. However, now she finally saw the true power of this bloodied man who constantly trained in the wild!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Ting Lan, Li Zhan, and Shang Heng saw as difficult prisoners now became insignificant life forms that Chu Mu could kill with ease. The prisoners still alive were all shadowed with death. They were all soul pet trainers that lived over thirty years. With their understanding of the young generation, it was almost impossible for someone that could beat all fo them to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, they still ended meeting this abnormal young man. As a result, they were being slaughtered like pigs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did it turn out like this, we had so many people…” The eighth rank prisoner that lost two of his top tier commander ranks looked as if he had lost his mind as well, staring blankly at the corpse-ridden grounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just ten minutes ago, this prisoner was still fantasizing about the female soul pet trainer’s attractive body. Ten minutes later, his head was filled with nothing but fear, without the energy to escape because of his damaged soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” A silver figure strangely passed by this eighth rank prisoner’s body. This eighth rank prisoner seemed to get startled. He lifted his head up and only saw the black clothed man’s emotionless eyes on the Nine tail Inferno Fox. A coldness came from his neck, prompting the eighth rank prisoner to touch it, just to discover that unceasing blood was spurting out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wu~en~~~~” His throat was cut open, converting his cries of pains into gargles.</span></p>

The eighth rank prisoner leader’s face twitched with a terrible expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he no longer had a chance to win, so he viciously glanced at the other prisoner. While this eighth rank prisoner’s top tier commander rank was being attacked by Mo Xie, he suddenly turned around and ran towards this prisoner in an attempt to escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prisoner that made Ting Lan most angry was the prisoner leader. The other leaders could be let go, but this lead prisoner that killed and mocked Li Zhan definitely couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing as the leader was about to escape, Ting Lan quickly rode his wing type soul pet downwards towards the eighth rank prisoners.</span></p>

This eighth rank prisoner was also very sly, so Ting Lan could fall for something easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan didn’t force herself this time, simply riding her wing type soul pet high above the ieghth rank prisoner’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Ting Lan didn’t dive down, the eighth rank prisoner’s face twitched again. Clearly, the plan of baiting the wounded Ting Lan to come down and taking her as hostage fell through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Ye Qingzi’s War Court Black Beast dealt with the other two top tier commander ranks, it became a black blade that caught up to the escaping eighth rank prisoner in mere seconds!!</span></p>

Suddenly, the top tier commander rank he was riding was enveloped in a beast type aura as its muscles expanded, nearly ripping through skin!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nong!!!!!!!!” This top tier commander waved its powerful arms and slammed them heavily towards the running War Court Black Beast!</span></p>
