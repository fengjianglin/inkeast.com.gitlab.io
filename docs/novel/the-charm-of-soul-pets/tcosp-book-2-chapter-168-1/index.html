 <p><strong>Chapter 168: Zhan Ye’s New Technique, Heavenly Splitting Claw</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Mu has already reached the spirit master level?” Meng Huazhong looked at the coarse and demonic White Nightmare, and his face revealed a rather disbelieving expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meng Huazhong had neared his middle ages before finally becoming a spirit master. Moreover, once he entered this realm, he had never received an opportunity to obtain a truly fitting monarch ranked soul pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the rumors, Menghua Zhong had heard that Chu Mu wasn’t even twenty, yet he was already a spirit master at this tender age. Moreover, he controlled the two great monarchs, the Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox and the White Nightmare. Perhaps in comparison, Chu Mu’s current soul pets weren’t a match for him, but once those two monarchs matured, Meng Huazhong definitely wouldn’t dare to fight against Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silent and cold white demonic devil flames ceaselessly welled up, burning the two eighth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects’ souls as they let out painful shouts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two eighth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects beat their six flesh wings, and they instantly flew high into the sky. They fundamentally didn’t dare to fight against the powerful monarch ranked White Nightmare, and began to unceasingly dodge the white demonic devil flames by soaring high in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Nightmare, chase after them.” Chu Mu was very reassured towards the White Nightmare’s fighting strength, and he immediately had it pursue into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jie jie~~~~” the White Nightmare produced a devilish evil laughing noise. Its two legs gradually began floating into the air under the support of the top of the white flames. Its body burning in white demonic soul devil flames was arrogant, and its mannerism was violent, as it was full of a monarch’s hegemony!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Mu, your Mo Ye’s life is in danger.” Ye Qingzi was in charge of supporting Chu Mu’s three soul pets. The White Nightmare and Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Demon Fox had abnormally terrifying fighting strength, so dealing with these Heavenly Devil Insects wasn’t too much of an issue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Mu’s Warbeast Mo Ye was only at the sixth phase third stage, and its fighting strength was only comparable with a fire-rate talent commander at most. Even if its life force and recovery strength was even more powerful, it still ultimately suffered from heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhan Ye, Broken Limb Rebirth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu was naturally paying attention to Zhan Ye’s fight. Seeing that the wounds on its body were hard to heal, he decisively had Zhan Ye use the rebirth technique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several bloody holes had already appeared on Zhan Ye’s ink armor. When Zhan Ye used Broken Limb Rebirth, these bloody holes were quickly overflowed with life force recovery insect fluid that covered the wounds, before rapidly attaching to Zhan Ye’s ink armor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a few seconds, the wounds on Zhan Ye’s body were completely healed. The ink armor spinning on its skin once more irradiated its original jet-black lustre, the spikes were evident and it was incomparably firm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once, its fighting strength was recovered once again, Zhan Ye’s exuberant fighting spirit once more burst forth. Its bloody red pupils closely stared at one of the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dark Steal!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black colored ink armored tiger body flew out, and it created a long shadow on the ground. It was like a black whirlwind charging onto the side of that sixth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shattering Claw!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both claws extended at the same time, and the shattering claw fiercely smashed into that sixth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body. Its insect armor was instantly smashed into pieces, and its insect body unexpectedly completely exploded! Blood, serum fluid and brain tissue burst out and nauseatingly splattered onto the ground...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rebirth ability?” Ye Qingzi opened her lips and let out a rather astonished expression!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder you can be so calm.” seeing the Warbeast Mo Ye whose strength had fully recovered, Ye Qingzi suddenly understood. She silently wondered in her heart where on earth Chu Mu had obtained so many strange pets and odd beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Mu cracked a smile and said: “Its potential is much more than just this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true, Zhan Ye’s potential definitely wasn’t merely this. Broken Limb Rebirth allowed Zhan Ye to possess a persistent form of battle strength. Yet, it was its tenacious and unbending fighting spirit that truly caused the opponent a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou Hou~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye nimbly dodged the Dark Meteor Flying Attack swooping down before continuously jumping a few times. It agilely jumped onto the teetering summit of the rock garden!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Death Ray!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark light condensed in its throat and was abruptly spat towards a Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect flying in the sky!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect had already been injured by Zhan Ye earlier. After suffering form another Death Ray attack, its insect body, missing one wing, swayed in the air before crashing to the ground. It resolutely smashed into the mud! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weng weng weng~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, there were only fifteen remaining Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect covering the surroundings. Two of them promptly used their insect armored body to ferociously charge towards Zhan Ye from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attacks were so concentrated that Zhan Ye was unable to dodge. It was knocked flying from the rock garden, and it slid along the ground...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whilst sliding along the ground and sustaining injuries, five insect lights were spat out from the air and exploded next to Zhan Ye’s body. Several wounds blew up on the new insect armor that Zhan Ye had just changed into.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weng weng weng!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four Heavenly Devil Insects swooped down from the air, and their claw-like arms fiercely cut Zhan Ye’s four limbs. Zhan Ye simply couldn’t stand up and incomparably deep wounds appeared on its four limbs...</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Qingzi watched this Zhan Ye of Chu Mu’s continuously suffer setbacks, she was silently anxious in her heart. She immediately had the Water Moon use Healing Water Heart on Zhan Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gentle ribbon of water curled around Zhan Ye’s four limbs and, like the soft hands of a woman, they gently healed the wounds on Zhan Ye’s body...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wounds on Zhan Ye’s four limbs began to heal, but before they were fully healed, a few insect lights came bombarding down once again. They caused the ink armor on Zhan Ye’s back to shatter in pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Mu!” Ye Qingzi reminded this heartless man once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rebirth.” Chu Mu didn’t explain any further and directly had Zhan Ye use the second Broken Limb Rebirth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye’s fighting strength was extremely limited. It wasn’t that Chu Mu was heartless, but rather that if Zhan Ye didn’t train itself in this sort of a fight, with its innate strength, even using more spirit items would be to no avail. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from fighting, Chu Mu’s method of training Zhan Ye was still also through fighting. Moreover, he had to challenge the limits of its fighting. Only by tempering Zhan Ye’s body to become even stronger and igniting all of Zhan Ye’s potential would the effects of spirit item strengthening be more prominent. Otherwise, Zhan Ye would never be able to become a soul pet that was truly capable of surpassing its own rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its blood colored pupils burned once again with a vigorous fighting spirit. The Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect had genuinely angered Zhan Ye completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second Broken Limb Rebirth was completed instantaneous. Zhan Ye’s ink armor spikes extended once more. Simply ignoring all attacks, it directly charged towards a few of the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects that had seriously injured its four limbs!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pu Chi!!!!!” the eminently sharp ink armor spikes entirely ignored the Four Winged Heavenly Devil’s insect armor and tore a Heavenly Devil Insect’s insect armor into pieces!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Death Ray!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Death Ray contained in its mouth was shot out at close range!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hong~~~~~~’ the Death Ray exploded on the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body which insect armor had been pierced through, causing its body to be smashed into pieces. Body juices and blood sprayed all over Zhan Ye’s ink colored armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the blood-soaked fighting Warbeast Mo Ye, Ye Qingzi opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but she didn’t know what to say. After all, this was the first time she had seen such a tenacious soul pet with an ability to resist attacks like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After adding on Violent Blood Pupil’s effects, this Mo Ye had reached the sixth phase third stage. &nbsp;With this rank and phase and stage it, at most, could contend with two or three seventh phase warrior Heavenly Devil Insects. Yet, this Mo Ye had killed six of the twenty Heavenly Devil Insects surrounding it. This truly wasn’t some average bravery and powerfulness! </span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Broken Limb Rebirth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Death Ray, Shattering Claw, Dark Steel, Ink Armor Spike, Steel Tail, Uninhibited Assault… all of Zhan Ye’s techniques were repeatedly used, and the Heavenly Devil Insects besieging Zhan Ye decreased one by one...</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Broken Limb Rebirth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the fifth Broken Limb Rebirth, Ye Qingzi truly didn’t know what to say. As she watched this Warbeast Mo Ye that was still fighting at close quarters with an incomparably vigorous fighting spirit against the remaining five Heavenly Devil Insect’s attacks, she ultimately could only give Chu Mu’s Zhan Ye a conclusive and fitting evaluation - an abnormal soul pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the twenty Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects, there now only remained one last one. This probably was the group amongst Heavenly Devil Insects that had died in the most depressing way, unexpectedly being completely annihilated by a sixth phase commander.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou Hou Hou!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the sixth Broken Limb Rebirth, Zhan Ye used the Water Moon’s water pillars to jump into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Splitting Claw!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The powerful ink claws ferociously cleaved apart two imposing claw marks from two sides. These two claw marks manifested into two gorgeous, sickle-like grey curves and tore the last Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect into shreds!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four flesh wings, four arms, and an insect armored body was essentially ripped apart at the same time. The disintegrated Heavenly Devil Insect’s corpse crashed to the ground after Zhan Ye steadily landed beside it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou Hou!!!!” twenty Heavenly Devil Insects were completely annihilated. Proudly standing on top of these Heavenly Devil Insect corpses, this soul pet with an undying fighting spirit let out an even more satisfied roar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Comprehended a new fighting technique!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s face instantly revealed a delighted expression, and he called back Zhan Ye, which had defeated all its opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sixth rank fighting technique - Heavenly Splitting Claw, very good. It seems that your beast attribute is slowly strengthening. In the future, you’ll definitely be able to comprehend even stronger fighting techniques.” Chu Mu laughed as he rubbed Zhan Ye’s sturdy head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from Broken Limb Rebirth which was a seventh rank bug type technique, Zhan Ye’s other bug type fighting techniques were all under the fifth rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifth rank and under were practically all warrior rank techniques. Being able to comprehend the sixth rank Heavenly Splitting Claw meant that Zhan Ye’s present beast type talent was already close to a normal beast type commander.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching Chu Mu praise his own soul pet, Ye Qingzi was slightly speechless towards Chu Mu and his soul pets. Originally, she had wanted to have the Water Moon return and heal Zhan Ye, but when she saw the ink armor full of bright blood, she felt that there wasn’t a need to use the healing technique...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi had never seen such a masochistic sort of fight. She further hadn’t seen a soul pet comprehend a new technique after such an ordeal of masochism. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Qingzi had no choice but to admit the abilities of Chu Mu’s Mo Ye were truly extremely abnormal. If its phase and stage were to increase, and its attributes were to be strengthened, it definitely would be able to take on everything by itself!</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu wu wu~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s fight had already neared the end. An Illusion Royal Flame Claw abruptly flashed by, and the last Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s flesh wings began to spill blood one after the other, before all of the wings fell to the ground!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie carefully obeyed Chu Mu’s instructions, and she didn’t use blood flames. The demon fire evil flames swept through and immediately burned the seventh phase high staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood compression vial in her fur instantly began to collect blood of the seventh phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect into the vial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie, go and help them. On the way, collect all the blood in the courtyard.” Chu Mu glanced at Feng Qi and Zhang Qian’s fight, where they were struggling a bit as he spoke to Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu~~” nodded Mo Xie. She exhibited her ostentatious monarch disposition, and she transformed into a royal flame gale that swept through her path unobstructed….</span></p>
