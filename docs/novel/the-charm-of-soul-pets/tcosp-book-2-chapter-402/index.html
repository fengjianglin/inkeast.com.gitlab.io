He was dressed completely brown. If he hadn’t summoned any soul pet, when he stood still, he would be like a hawk with extreme killer instinct. At any moment he would be able to launch a fatal attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man didn’t even look at Chu Mu. He even ignored the dozens of Soul Palace soul pets surrounding him. Instead, he used his two sharp eyes to stare at Shen Yicheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man had very evidently emerged to save Shen Yicheng, but for some unknown reason, when Shen Yicheng saw this man, none of the fear from impending death seemed to disappear. His entire face was pale and he fumbled his words as he spoke: “I was only lacking a little bit… I could have completed it…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And you have one life less.” coldly said the hawk-like man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking, this man slowly turned around, he stared imposingly at the leader of all the Soul Palace guards, and Chu Mu, he coldly said: “You’ve killed so many of my subordinates, so you won’t mind if I killed all your subordinates, right?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment his tone dropped the man’s aura abruptly burst forth and instantly, it was as if the entire street was suddenly hit with a snowstorm. A patch of uneven ground was completely crushed to pieces by the force and the destroyed structures were covered by a layer of thick ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Transforming aura into ice type energy!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This terrifying ice aura caused everyone to take multiple steps back. The soul pets surrounding Shen Yicheng and Feng Kun were also terrified, and didn’t dare move an inch. Holding their breath and with rapt attention, they lay low on the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man hadn’t summoned any soul pets, yet this strength was already capable to making others quake in fear. Such an expert simply wasn’t someone they, as young generation members, could compete with. Over forty Soul Palace guards were presently dripping with sweat. An intense killing intent was shrouding over their heads, causing them to tremble in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, unless their leader gave the order, they wouldn’t dare flee. They had thus effectively become livestock to be slaughtered by any person at this point. They could only focus their gazes on their leader, hoping that he would be able to think of a solution fast, otherwise this man would annihilate them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is your name. After killing all of your subordinates, I will let you go. However, today’s matter won’t end just like this!” the man’s killing intent pervaded the air and his eyes stared at Chu Mu as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Chen.” Chu Mu calmly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The name Chu Chen was a symbollic alias of radiant heroism to commit heinous deeds. Thus, Chu Mu did not care if he told him or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Chen!” Shen Yicheng opened his eyes a bit wider and glared at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Chen was very evidently a third grade member of Soul Palace. Shen Yicheng had never expected he would be forced into such a wretched state by a third grade member. Most importantly, Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng had already mentioned this person before, but Shen Yicheng had never placed any importance on it. He should have had Zhuo Xiao just get rid of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ultimately, the Soul Palace leader that had annihilated all of his subordinates was this Chu Chen. Where on earth had this Soul Palace Chu Chen come from?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember and observe a moment of silence for your subordinates. You can only blame them for following the wrong person.” the hawk-like man finally had the intention to kill and it was possible to sense him chanting an incantation. Moreover, from the enormous aura, it was possible to see that the soul pet he was about to summon would be able to easily instakill them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leader!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Chu Chen!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of Soul Palace’s guards had pale faces. They were trembling with fear and slowly retreated as they stared at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t say anything. Instead, he stepped forward towards Shen Yicheng’s Violent Blood Pool Beast bound to the ground by Ye Qingzi’s soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody understood his actions, but very soon, the trembling guards discovered that when Chu Mu left, a man who hadn’t appeared yet walked out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hawk man’s ice and killing aura didn’t have any effect on this man. The man continued to walk forward with steady steps and when he walked, everyone could see that he even had an engrossed smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of an extreme expert that could instakill all of the soul pets on the field, this person was still able to maintain a smile! Casual, free and no traces of seriousness or anxiety could be sensed. Nor was there any hint of false bravado.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hawk man was about to finish chanting his incantation, and just as he was about to summon his soul pet, his actions came to an abrupt halt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His two sharp eyes opened a bit wider, and he closely watched the man walking over to him. The expression on his face further proceeded to freeze up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be anxious, continue summoning. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen your soul pets. Summon them for me.” the man who walked out from behind Chu Mu began to laugh. He seemed very carefree, but the words he spoke caused everyone to blush with shame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Hen…” the hawk man stood there, his face ashen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul Palace… Li Hen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul Palace’s famous expert, Li Hen, was recognized by all but few. The hawk man had already realized earlier that there was definitely a middle aged Soul Palace expert backing Chu Mu and this was the reason why he didn’t kill Chu Mu. However, he never thought that the person protecting Chu Mu was among Soul Palace’s strongest, the middle aged new talent Li Hen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he not be clear of Li Hen’s strength? Continue summoning? The hawk man was sure that no matter how many soul pets he summoned, he wasn’t the opponent of the man in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, this fellow was also a fierce character who didn’t care about anything. He perhaps wouldn’t kill people, but killing one or two soul pets was something he would definitely do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why aren’t you summoning anymore? In the fight just now you were practically like a supreme expert hiding in the shadows. According to the way traditional stories go, you should have annihilated the entire battlefield before carefreely taking away your useless juniors with you. It would help you to release your bad aura… yet now you’re not summoning soul pets anymore. Could it be that the aura you released just now was just a fart?!” mocked Li Hen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hawk man grit his teeth. There was nothing more aggravating than being humiliated in front of others. However, he truly didn’t dare to summon . The moment he did, Li Hen would have a reason to attack and when that time came, the losses would be even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t want to interfere in a fight between the younger generation. However, your Soul Palace people perhaps went too overboard, killing so many of my Merchant Alliance’s subordinates. Moreover, they were going to kill Shen Yicheng. If I hadn’t happened to passed by and prevented this tragedy, wouldn’t this matter have ended up at an even higher level?” said the hawk man incomparably sullenly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As expected… the older one is, the lower one’s character is. Hmph… you just happened to pass through and prevent this matter from ending at a higher level? Sure you can say these things. I’ll feel embarrassed for you, don’t worry. What does it matter if your Merchant Alliance’s trash has been killed? If you can’t accept this and yell for the help of others, our leader won’t be able to kill with satisfaction. If you don’t dare fight, then scram with your tail between your legs and then pay for the damage that you owe in this street district. Your Merchant Alliance has a lot of money and doesn’t care about this sort of stuff.” when Li Hen spoke, he was extremely unsatisfied. He felt like he was in a street gangster fight without the slightest demeanor of a Soul Palace divine senior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, Li Hen’s gangster talk and imposing mannerism caused the forty guards to shout for joy. Especially after they saw the darkened sullen expression of the hawk man, they all began to laugh and involuntarily felt prideful.</span></p>
