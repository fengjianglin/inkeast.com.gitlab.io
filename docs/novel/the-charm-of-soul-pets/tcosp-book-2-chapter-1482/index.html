 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhengming Main City</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They entered Zhengming Main City again. New Moon Palace already had a place in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo had managed the palace here in a very organized manner. Liu Binglan was very satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Wanxiang City, Shen Mo had gradually replaced his father, the senior elder, and Nightmare Emperor Jiang’s position, taking charge of Nightmare Palace. As New Moon Land expanded into other border kingdoms and established palaces, Liu Binglan felt that Shen Mo would probably do a good job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The facts proved that Shen Mo was actually an outstanding administrator. When Liu Binglan was in Zhengming Main City last time, not many people knew of New Moon Land. But this time, she discovered that many people understood at least a bit about New Moon Palace. He had even won over the support of many experts who were willing to serve New Moon Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just do things according to your methods.” Liu Binglan faintly smiled as she looked at Shen Mo who had given her a summary of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo proposed numerous expansion plans. These plans had to utilize some resources from New Moon Land so he had to obtain permission from Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo was definitely one of them so Liu Binglan gave him the authority to utilize it as he wished. Indeed, New Moon Land in the future would ultimately belong to people like him. Once Liu Binglan retired, she would have to find a successor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan went from New Moon Land to various border kingdoms in Zhengming Continent. She was even on a trip to Northern Territory where she met many city lords, border lords, and kings. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But for some reason, their allies that were originally friendly towards New Moon Land were now acting strange recently. This made Liu Binglan feel a bit uneasy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Border Lord Li, who they had the best relationship with them had quietly told Liu Binglan of some rumors that certain factions were targeting New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan felt as much recently. New Moon Land’s development had initially gone very smoothly. In the last half a year, however, it had been impeded in several border kingdoms. Additionally, there were a few people harboring evil intentions that had entered New Moon Land with intentions of destroying New Moon Land’s internal unity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current New Moon Land could be described as having encountered a bottleneck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This bottleneck didn’t come from New Moon Land, but instead originated from the collusion, rejection, suppression of other powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were over a hundred border kingdoms and New Moon Land only had their palace in around thirty border cities. This included their current symbolic palace in Zhengming Main City. The other seventy or so border kingdoms didn’t permit the influence from New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of New Moon Land’s foreign members were wandering soul pet trainers. They wandered to other border kingdoms but didn’t belong to any faction in New Moon Land. This meant that these members had no sense of belonging and would lead to members being lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo had predicted that such a situation would occur. Initially, Shen Mo believed that this was because New Moon Land didn’t have any gate master rank experts. But he gradually discovered that even with a gate master rank expert overseeing them, New Moon Land would still be limited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only a few immortal rank experts in Zhengming Continent. If they couldn’t expand their influence and reach other border territories, it would practically impossible to rope in additional immortal rank experts. Indeed, the absolute majority of immortal rank experts had a place they belonged to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had a slight headache because of this matter, but she didn’t have any better method.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the night, Liu Binglan sat in the courtyard and she went over everything that happened and the people she saw during this trip. She wanted to try and guess something from the reaction of these people she saw.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering, a fragrant wind drifted over. It was unique and wonderful. A single sniff would make one feel like the exhaustion from travel had greatly been reduced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a person where this intoxicating fragrance would pervade the air before the person had even arrived. Liu Binglan knew who had appeared in the courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sit.” Liu Binglan pointed to the seat next to her as she spoke to the absolute beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had to be admitted that this woman had an absolutely beautiful face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had silky purple hair that reached her bum, a smooth and glossy forehead that was as exquisite as a gemstone, thin eyebrows a unique womanly bearing that would be exhibited without needing to be described and resplendent eyes with hints of mystery and wisdom and even moreso a unique charm. A single glance would make one fall deep into these eyes as they looked at charming smile that also wasn’t a smile. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan normally didn’t take time to examine her in the past. But it was rare for them to sit as close as they were today. Liu Binglan was also curious how such a flawless beauty could exist in this world. She was so beautiful that even Liu Binglan, an absolute beauty herself, felt a bit jealous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, perhaps they were at opposition and there even may have been hatred. But this was a long time ago. These things would naturally fade away. And even without Empress Concubine Yu Suo back then, Soul Alliance, which still had absolute strength, would have ultimately swallowed Three Great Palaces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you curious why we have the same pair of eyes?” Yu Suo discovered that Liu Binglan was examining her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo’s words made Liu Binglan notice this. Yu Suo’s eyes were actually flashing with a somewhat purple luster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, she never noticed this. But now she was very confused. Did she and Yu Suo have some sort of relation?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do these eyes represent?” asked Yu Suo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It represents that our bloodline is superior to all humans you’ve seen.” Yu Suo said with an arrogant tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had never felt she was superior. But if they were speaking about specifics, it would just be that her soul remembrance growth speed was much higher than others as well as her cultivation method was different than others. She had her own independent cultivation space that others didn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This uniqueness allowed her strength to remain at a rather high level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lot of people in New Moon Land knew that Chu Mu, Mu Qingyi, Ye Qingzi, Chao Lengchuan, Ye Wansheng and Bai Yu were very strong. However, they didn’t know that New Moon Land actually had the absolute Female Supreme Liu Binglan who was very strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, very many foreign border lords and city lords believed that Liu Binglan was a weak and helpless woman because from the information they obtained, Liu Binglan rarely went out to train. The only time she had fought was in the New Moon Land independence fight which happened a long time ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you targeting me first at Sacred Holy Region and signing a soul pact with Chu Mu wasn’t a coincidence?” Liu Binglan quickly realized a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was a coincidence. At the time, I had no place to go and I had to choose a host. Choosing you definitely wouldn’t do. Your cautiousness was too high and your growth speed, if left uninhibited, would definitely be very fast and could even suppress me. Therefore, I could only choose Chu Mu… only, I never expected…” Yu Suo revealed a wave of bitterness. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You never expected his growth speed to be much faster than mine.” Liu Binglan suddenly felt that this was rather interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever, it’s already like this.” Yu Suo knew that she had given her Flower’s Stamen, which was like a heart, to Chu Mu. There would be no opportunity to rebel in this life. No matter how strong she was, she would always be his soul pet. She would never be able to flee unless Chu Mu willingly gave back her Flower’s Stamen to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about the eyes? Are you and I related somehow?” Liu Binglan brought the topic back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If your hair was also a purple color, perhaps we would have some sort of blood relation. However, your hair is black,” said Yu Suo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan still didn’t understand Yu Suo, but she was now certain that before Yu Suo transformed into a half-human, she was probably a human with a very high blood lineage. Perhaps she was a member of the two royal families that had sent out invites this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do you harbor such enormous grievance in your heart? I feel that you probably weren’t like this in the past,” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My grievance was because the past me was too weak, too immature, and too laughable.” Yu Suo gazed into the distance. The corners of her mouth faintly rose as she smiled and continued, “You should understand that kindness and devotion are useless in this world. That Messiah Tree Girl. She will either die in ruins or become a second me.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan heard about Ning Maner’s matter from Chu Mu. When she heard Yu Suo say this, she couldn’t help but guess what Yu Suo’s past was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo had a unique temperament. This was pureness and holiness that she was born with that allowed her to easily generate affinity with other organisms. This indeed had similarities with Ning Maner’s kindness and pureness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the good side of the Evil Good Queen wasn’t an act. It could be innate. But the evil side was also innate. Thus, she innately was a contradictory existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What relation do you have with Ning Maner?” asked Liu Binglan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo shook her head and said: “No relation. She is herself, and I am myself. Only our experiences are a bit similar. However, her luck is better than mine. When she needed protection, there was someone to protect her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you have someone now?” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you referring to Chu Mu?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He wants nothing more than to kill me. Moreover, he’s sick in the head and enjoys abusing others,” said Yu Suo with a face full of arrogance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Liu Binglan was somewhat speechless. This woman was speaking bad about her son in front of her. If it were anyone else, Liu Binglan would have already sorted them out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Speaking of which, Chu Mu had indeed tortured Yu Suo quite harshly. A normal person would not have been able to withstand such devil flame burning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Ye Qingzi was kindhearted, and had secretly helped Yu Suo lessen much of the devil flame burning pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s grievance towards Yu Suo was very large. Nonetheless, Ye Qingzi was looking at things from an objective viewpoint and didn’t wish for their conflict and hatred to continue expanding. Her actions were indeed very intelligent. At least now it could be seen that everything Yu Suo was doing was technically to protect New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will also participate in Dual Earth Mountain’s conference. You must be careful at this conference. There will probably be many people targeting you.” Yu Suo warned Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I felt as much.” Liu Binglan nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before participating in the conference, Liu Binglan had sensed that things weren’t right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a very strong faction attempting to destroy New Moon Land. You must make adequate preparations. It won’t be good for my strength to be revealed. If you’re able to weather through this time, in future Dual Earth Mountain conferences and in the entire Zhengming Continent, we will have absolute influence.” said Yu Suo.</span></p>
