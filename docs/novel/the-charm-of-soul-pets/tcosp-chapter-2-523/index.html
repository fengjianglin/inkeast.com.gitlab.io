 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just now someone had opened a medicine bottle and Xia Guanghan had used this opportunity to approach Chu Mu and the others. He was waiting for Chu Mu to lose his guard before taking Chu Mu down in one fell swoop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Xia Guanghan never expected that Chu MU’s Mo Xie had firmly remembered his smell when they fought in the demon’s home. Him approaching Chu Mu now was equivalent to exposing himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s eyes stared closely at the man covered completely by golden armor. In the past, Chu Mu was like an ant in front of this person. If were to merely lift his leg, he could easily trample him to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, Chu Mu was only 15. At that age, Xia Guanghan’s strength made Chu Mu feel fear and an insurmountable obstacle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bu many years had now passed and Xia Guanghan had appeared once again before him. Chu Mu’s strength was no longer as different from his and when Chu Mu saw this great enemy of his appear in front of him, his blood didn’t completely feel a sensation of danger. Instead, there was also an ambition to firmly step on this man who he used to feel was difficult to overcome!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wu wu wu wu~~~~~~~”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xie and Chu Mu had known each other the longest and their emotions for each other were the deepest. Back then, Xia Guanghan had nearly forced her and Chu Mu to come to an end. The soul pact rupture’s soul pain occurred in both parties. When Chu Mu’s body was convulsing, Mo Xie’s soul would equally tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During that experience, Mo Xie had been weak and could only let that executioner do as he pleased. But now, Mo Xie’s strength had greatly increased, reaching the ninth phase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted nothing more than to attack know and rip that Sunset Eagle to pieces before ripping Xia Guanghan’s flesh off one piece at a time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was you guys that killed this person?” Xia Guanghan intentionally lowered his voice before pointing at Duan Xinze’s head under his feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Guanghan recognized this head. It was the ninth rank prisoner, Duan Xinze who had been ordained as the highest honor reward. Even though his strength had been severely restricted, to the majority of the competitors, he was still difficult to fight. Xia Guanghan was a bit surprised the four people could kill him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. He was killed by our Soul Palace’s Chu Chen. In truth, we didn’t do anything.” Shang Heng intentionally praised Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? He’s that amazing?” Xia Guanghan’s face showed a few traces of astonishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the information Xia Guanghan had obtained beforehand, Chu Mu’s strength probably barely ranked within the top tens of the large factions. Xia Guanghan couldn’t enter the competition himself while Chu Mu had remained hiding inside Soul Palace. Therefore, Xia Guanghan could only have Zhuo Xiao deal with Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was greeted with surprise, because Chu Mu had been able to defeat the ninth rank prisoner Duan Xinhe. This meant that he was still hiding some strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was merely astonished, but not afraid. The severely restricted strength of Duan Xinze was not on the same level as the current Xia Guanghan. As long as he had the chance to attack, any number of Chu Mu’s would all die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu didn’t say anything and simply stood beside Ye Qingzi, calmly thinking of countermeasures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Direct confrontation wouldn’t work. With Xia Guanghan’s strength, even if he defeated him, his soul pets would be wounded and even if only one of his soul pets was wounded, it would be difficult for Chu Mu to continue the realm breakthrough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The adjacent Ye Qingzi seemed to detect Chu Mu’s change in, mood even though this change was extremely minute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked back at the golden armored competition authority guard before looking at Chu Mu again. She discovered that Chu Mu seemed to be keeping a certain distance away from this fellow. This distance was precisely a fighting distance!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi didn’t understand why Chu Mu was so cautious towards this competition authority guard. Competition authority guards were chosen by the various large factions in the Battle of the Realm. These people had to strictly adhere to competition rules and it was their job this time to protect the competitors and prevent prisoners from harming them. There shouldn’t be such a need to be so cautious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Mu, what’s the matter/” Ye Qingzi asked Chu Mu with her soul remembrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is the enemy I spoke about.” Chu Mu used soul remembrance to speak to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi immediately showed a shocked expression. She never expected that Chu Mu’s great enemy would appear under the identity of a competition authority guard. This meant that Chu Mu’s enemy wasn’t a young generation person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingzi wasn’t a stupid woman and she quickly hid her shock, not letting Xia Guanghan sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the fight still hadn’t started, this meant that the opposing side was afraid of something, and wasn’t going to attack for the time being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, from a safety perspective, Ye Qingzi still quietly gave her soul pets orders to watch Xia Guanghan’s Sunset Eagle. The moment something happened, her soul pets would immediately attack the Sunset Eagle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do now? Fight?” Ye Qingzi asked Chu Mu with soul remembrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not for the time being. Ting Lan and Shang Heng are here, so there’s a chance he doesn’t dare attack me.” Chu Mu responded with soul remembrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a competition authority guard, unless Xia Guanghan was able to kill all four of them, he would definitely suffer the Battle of the Realm competition authority’s punishment afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, regardless if it was Chu Mu or Ting Lan, both of their statuses in Soul Palace were extremely high. If Xia Guanghan didn’t have a very high chance of success, he wouldn’t easily take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This guard, take us down the mountain. We’re withdrawing from the competition.” Ting Lan said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Guanghan nodded his head and said to Ting Lan and Shang Heng: “Recall your soul pets and come onto my Sunset Eagle.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan and Shang Heng didn’t have any intentions of continuing to fight. To them, the eighth realm was pretty much their limit. If they tried to continue, they would very likely suffer the attacks of prisoners.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t recall your soul pets!” however, just as the two of them were about to recall their soul pets, Chu Mu instantly spoke to them with soul remembrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Ting Lan and Shang Heng recalled their soul pets and sat on Xia Guanghan’s Sunset Eagle, Xia Guanghan would definitely immediately kill the two of them. Xia Guanghan was a ruthless person and if he had the opportunity to kill the two of them in one fell swoop, he would definitely take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan was stunned and quickly asked Chu Mu with soul remembrance: “Why? The competition authority guard has already appeared. We’re very safe.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two listen closely. Don’t show any signs of panic. Feign calmness and pretend to say something secretive to Ye Qingzi.” Chu Mu used soul remembrance to speak to Ting Lan and Shang Heng. “The truth is that this competition authority guard is my enemy and his methods are ruthless.
