 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng stared closely at Zhu Chao through their masks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To them, their teacher, Ying Rong, was like a father. Thinking of the betrayal of their teacher, who had raised them for many years, by the person sitting at the highest point in the stands and being respected and admired by countless people, they wanted nothing more than to kill him right now!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhu Chao!” Ye Qingzi’s eyes turned cold, and her hands began to lightly tremble as they pressed down on the stone table!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been many years, and the two of them had always hidden their names and lived under the shadow of Soul Alliance. This was all because of Zhu Chao. Now that their enemy was in front of them, how could they remain calm?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingzi…” Ye Wansheng restrained Ye Qingzi’s hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was getting harder and harder for Ye Qingzi to control her emotions. Ye Wansheng was afraid that the soul ability competition would be affected by her hatred.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi took in a deep breath, and slowly quelled the anger in her heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, each time she looked at the self-righteous old face of Zhu Chao, a nauseating feeling would well up inside her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Continue. I’ve only come to take a look.” Zhu Chao swept his gaze over the outstanding soul teachers, and lightly smiled as he shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main adjudicator nodded his head, releasing the topic of the second round.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Begin!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the adjudicator announced that the round was beginning, all of the soul teachers lowered their heads and began using their hands and soul remembrance to mix and divide the incomparably complex spirit items. They began the extremely important spirit item concoction among soul abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Easier spirit item concoctions were relatively simple. One only had to know how to mix and the proportions to successfully concoct a relatively simple spirit item concoction. For example, when Chu Mu was on Prisoner Island, he had used what he understood to successfully mix.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, high ranking spirit items were not as easy. There were extremely complicated procedures, refinements, differentiations, proportions, sequential mixing, filtering, and combining… only soul teachers could grasp this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first round of extracting was clearly the most basic form of concocting spirit items. Now that the second round had become complete concoction, this would clearly differentiate everyone. There was a chance that even those whose names were read on in the first round would be eliminated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi placed the hatred in her heart to one side, and began to focus on concocting the spirit items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, perhaps her emotions were still slightly affected, because while concocting according to the procedure, she failed once. This was a rather low ranking mistake amongst high ranking soul abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She made a mistake.” Old Soul Teacher De said to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s state of mind had always been calm and steady. However, after Zhu Chao appeared, Chu Mu could detect a change in her emotions. It seemed that she had a deep hatred for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It won’t affect her, right?” Chu Mu asked, somewhat worriedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll see how she recovers. If she fails three times, the remaining amount of materials will not be enough to concoct a spirit item.” said Old Soul Teacher De.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After failing once, Ye Qingzi didn’t immediately refine again. Instead, she closed her eyes and took in a deep breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems that you were only good at extracting.” Zhu Zizhan glanced at Ye Qingzi, who was the only person of the first round of tables that had failed once. He was calmly mixing together medicine with a playful expression in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi knew that he was intentionally provoking her. After failing once, if she rushed straight in, the chances of failing a second time were extremely high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if I fail once, my quality will not be worse than yours.” Ye Qingzi calmed down and coolly replied to Zhu Zizhan’s provocation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really do talk big.” arrogantly smiled Zhu Zizhan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To soul teachers that put all their attention on concocting spirit items, time flowed very fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gradually, soul teachers who had failed three times chose to leave the arena because they no longer had the qualifications to enter the next round</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, there were a few soul teachers that concocted spirit items that they were satisfied with and the remaining materials was not enough to concoct even better spirit items. Therefore, they stopped concocting and silently waited for the end and watched the other soul teachers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truly outstanding soul teachers, when the concoct a spirit item, will use all of the materials and incorporate them all. So those people that still have left over materials but have finished already will be able to advance to the next round, but are not outstanding…” Old Soul teacher De gave Chu Mu a bit of insight into soul abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, because she already failed once and lost one third of her materials, the quality of what she concocts cannot compare to those who are truly strong?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. At least the utilization of the materials will greatly affect the quality of a spirit item. However, that doesn’t matter. It’s fine if she can enter the next round.” said Old Soul Teacher De.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder De, is the person next to you Chu Fangchen who angered Senior Mo LIng in Snow City?” suddenly, Zhu Chao glanced down and stared at the masked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Chao was one of the Eight Desolations, and he naturally knew about Fourth Hero Mo Ling’s loss in Snow City. He was indeed surprised that Soul Palace would have another young soul pet trainer even more outstanding than Soul Palace’s Crown Prince.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does Senior Elder Zhu have any advice?” calmly asked Old Soul Teacher De.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he called Zhu Chao a senior elder was because Zhu Chao was Soul Church’s senior elder, and Old Soul Teacher De naturally wouldn’t be polite to a great enemy who worked for Soul Alliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Soul City, this neutral city, neither side could rashly start a fight. If both appeared in the same setting, it was best for them to compete with words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t dare give advice. Perhaps he will become Soul Palace’s next Underworld Supreme if he doesn’t die… when that time comes, I, Zhu Chao, will need to be respectful.” Zhu Chao wore a profound smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of Soul Palace’s Four Supremes, the Underworld Supreme had the highest status. Historically, the Underworld Supreme also had the most authority in Soul Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, this generation’s Underworld Supreme seemed to be inferior to the previous generations and was unable to hold up by himself like Soul Pet Palace’s Li Hong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Chao was obviously not praising Chu Mu’s incredible potential. Instead, he was telling Chu Mu directly that he had already entered Soul Alliance’s black list of those who must die. In other words, he was telling Chu Mu to watch out!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“None of those that provoke the Four Heroes have a good ending.” added Zhu Chao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember someone called Qin Wu speak to me in the same way. In the end, not even his soul remained.” Chu Mu glanced at the arrogant Zhu Chao and spoke with sarcasm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph. I’ve seen many young people who don’t know how high the heavens are. Hasn’t anyone told you how big the gap between the high class emperor and peak emperor rank is? There are people in Wanxiang City that can annihilate you at this age. Don’t be conceited.” slowly said Zhu Chao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie’s forgiven mutation made her rank a high class emperor. Only because of her multiple attributes was she comparable to a peak emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle had been extremely chaotic in Snow City, so Mo Ling and the fleeing spirit emperors were not able to completely determine Chu Mu’s Seven Sins Fox. However, from the aura, they guessed that it was a high class emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, the information Zhu Chao obtained about Chu Fangchen clearly wasn’t complete. He thought that Chu Mu was someone whose strength had rapidly risen due to good luck. These sorts of soul pet trainers had appeared in the past, but all of them ended up getting stuck at a bottleneck, unable to break through their whole life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhu Chao, is there anything that you find displeasing about our three great palace’s most outstanding young man?” suddenly a man’s strong voice rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this voice, Zhu Chao’s expression slightly changed. He forced a smile and said: “Of course not. I was only advising this young man not to be so arrogant and hot-tempered. Otherwise, he will be greeted by a huge crisis.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At some moment, another middle aged man had appeared on the highest parts of the stands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man was mighty and bold and his eyes carried a bit of evil. He was probably a soul pet trainer that used other type and dark type soul pets. Otherwise, he would not be able to exude an aura that instilled fear in others without release his soul remembrance aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If he’s arrogant, he has the qualifications to be arrogant. If he’s hot tempered, he has the ability to be hot tempered. When you were his age, you were a brat who would get weak in the legs when you saw an emperor. What qualifications do you have to be criticizing him?” mocked the bold and evil middle aged man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of Old Soul Teacher De, Zhu Chao was willing to rudely warn Chu Mu with a few evil words. However, with Shen Qiu present, Zhu Chao couldn’t maintain his self-entitled mannerism.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nightmare Palace’s members had always been a fierce bunch. Their soul pets were even more of a headache to Soul Alliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Soul Pet Palace’s Great Senior Elder Shen Qiu, he was the leading fierce person of the soul pet trainer world. Unless an expert stronger than the Four Heroes appeared, there was ostensibly no one who dared provoke him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Qiu was Nightmare Palace’s second ranked expert, inferior only to Nightmare Emperor Jiang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Yang Que and Soul Alliance didn’t dare take action against the three great palaces inside Soul City was because Shen Qiu oversaw this city!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Fangchen, I heard from my son, Shen Mo, that you also had White Nightmares?” this was the first time Shen Qiu saw Chu Mu, but he was immediately interested in him possessing White Nightmares.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Chu Mu nodded his head. He really did have White NIghtmares.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I’ve said it before that Soul Palace’s Seven Diagram Saint Pets are too weak. They lack the aggressiveness of our Nightmares. Choosing the White Nightmare to be your soul pet is definitely the smartest choice of your life.” Senior Elder Shen was rather bullish, and said something very disparaging to Soul Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the side, Old Soul Teacher De bitterly laughed and said: “But don’t walk the same path as Nightmare Emperor Bai Yu…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you understand!” Shen Qiu glared at Old De and continued, “Bai Yu was the strongest person of our three great palaces. Even if he didn’t transform into a devil, would Li Hong dare fight Bai Yu? Not even Li Hong, even the current head of the Heroes lost to him back then. Tell me the last time a person like this appeared in your Soul Palace. All of them either died early or stopped advancing. Additionally, when we wanted you to look after Her Majesty Dawn Supreme because she had reached the spirit emperor rank so early and had the chance of entering the dominator rank, the outcome was that she suffered multiple soul injuries. What are Liu Xinji and Liu Zhong doing… if it wasn’t because the time wasn’t right, I would have already taken care of them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
