  <p></p>
  <div class="paragraph">
   “Shut up! Tell your trash wolf to get out of the way!” The owner of the Wind Fairy belittlingly glanced at the Hunting Wolf’s owner. Paying no more attention to him, he immediately controlled his Wind Fairy to chase after Mo Xie.
   <p></p>
   <p>“Idiot, how could your Wind Fairy hope to catch up to that Fox’s speed? Cast Wind Riding on the Nido Beast!” Wang Keluo ferociously glared at Sun Li, the owner of the Wind Fairy who damaged its own teammates.</p>
   <p>The Wind Fairy’s owner Sun Li expressed a hint of hatred, but grudgingly commanded his Wind Fairy to cast Wind Riding in order to increase the speed of the sluggish Nido Beast.</p>
   <p>Nido Beast, as a pure attack and defense organism, had a burst of speed after being imbued with Wind Riding. Its fighting strength immediately became very terrifying; its entire rock-covered, bovine form locked onto Mo Xie and began to charge.</p>
   <p>Wind started broiling around as sand was strewn everywhere. Just as Mo Xie was about to dodge to the side, two thorny vines sprouted from the ground and created spiky vine webs on either side of Mo Xie!</p>
   <p>Before Mo Xie could think of a countermeasure, rows upon rows of spikes abruptly fell from the sky. The black, spike-covered Thorny Demon Grass’s AOE ability fell like a thunderstorm towards the area where Mo Xie was locked up!</p>
   <p>Mo Xie’s fur instantly became tough, but with such a dense coverage, her body was still pricked slightly!</p>
   <p>The Thorny Demon Grass’s ability couldn’t cause too much harm to Mo Xie. What was really terrifying was the Nido Beast’s charge attack. This time Mo Xie was completely stuck in the Nido Beast’s charge with nowhere to dodge!</p>
   <p>“Mo Xie, meet it face on!!”</p>
   <p>With nowhere to dodge, staying in place would only cause her to withstand an even harsher attack. Chu Mu decisively chose to rush towards it instead.</p>
   <p>Mo Xie’s body tensed up and abruptly dashed forwards, directly into the Nido Beast who was four times bigger than her!!</p>
   <p>​With the vast area of the Nido Beast’s charge, even Moon Shadow would’ve been futile- all three shadows would’ve been hit. Chu Mu didn’t tell Mo Xie to use Moon Shadow to evade the attack, but rather directly issued a command to attack.</p>
   <p>“Blood Rending Claw!”</p>
   <p>In the process of running, Mo Xie suddenly extended her coldly glinting claws and approached the massive Nido Beast directly with her second rank late stage claws. She then ripped a shocking, bloody line across the Nido Beast’s head!</p>
   <p>A Nido Beast’s head was similar to a three horned statue, hard and sturdy!</p>
   <p>However, as the bloody glint passed by, a crack appeared on its statue-like head, spreading quickly throughout. Immediately after, the entire exoskeleton of the head shattered, falling from the Nido Beast’s head!</p>
   <p>“Beng!!”</p>
   <p>Although she hit the Nido Beast, its horns still hit Mo Xie. Her abdomen caved in as her body flew up ten meters. Her petite body flipped through the air helplessly…...</p>
   <p>“Ao!!!”</p>
   <p>The Nido Beast rose its shattered head and let out an excruciating roar. After this roar, the Nido Beast’s hard head, as if collapsed, violently ruptured!!</p>
   <p>Immediately, the bovine-like roar rolled through the silent stadium, echoing off the vast walls!</p>
   <p>Known for its defense, especially in its skull area, the Nido Beast’s skull still got shattered by one claw of the Moonlight Fox? This scene was both shocking and unbelievable!</p>
   <p>The appearance of the Blood Rending Claw was the main reason the entire stadium fell silent. At this moment, the deep-rooted stereotypes of the Moonlight Foxes being merely an ornamental pet were absolutely broken. Who could still believe that a Moonlight Fox that could shatter a Nido Beast’s head was only a little ornamental pet?</p>
   <p>Mo Xie’s body fell from the skies, skidding on the ground until it reached the edge of the protection shield. Seeing Mo Xie rammed by the charge, Chu Mu’s heart was torn with pain. A wrath started blazing within his body like a violent fire!</p>
   <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chu Mu’s grave face was filled with resolution and tenacity, his eyes full of anger and fighting spirit. Clenching his jaw, he directly locked his own soul remembrance in combat with Cao Yi’s Mental Shackles, and his resentment fueled&nbsp;his soul and unyielding spirit to batter Cao Yi’s mental world!!</span></p>
   <p>Cao Yi’s expression changed. At that moment, he could feel the powerful mental attacks that Chu Mu was making. These mental attacks had the power of a Spirit Soldier!</p>
   <p>Mo Xie rammed into the edge of the protective shield. Slowly standing up, a trace of blood was already seeping from her mouth, but her eyes were fixed on Chu Mu…...</p>
   <p>Strangely, the emotions revealed by Mo Xie’s silver pupils were identical to that of Chu Mu’s- both were filled with wrath, and both were fuelled by the strongest of fighting intents!</p>
   <p>Chu Mu and Mo Xie were interlinked by heart. When Chu Mu withstood immense pressure to fight against Cao Yi’s Remembrance, it also caused Mo Xie’s dignity as someone strong to become even more intense!</p>
   <p>“Mo Xie, moonlight!”</p>
   <p>While battling Cao Yi’s spirit, Chu Mu still hadn’t forgotten that Mo Xie was fighting for him, and he forcefully maintained his link with Mo Xie!</p>
   <p>“Let’s see how long your Soul Power can last!!” Cao Yi’s face contorted with anger. The power displayed by Chu Mu was already completely beyond his expectations, but this only reaffirmed his resolve to kill Chu Mu!</p>
   <p>Night had fallen on the island. Wailing winds whistled past, shepherding the dark clouds in the distance. The frigid, silver moonlight spilled onto the world, landing on the middle of the entire stadium, like sprites dancing and bathing in the light, spry and lively, beckoning for the darling of the moon to come over!</p>
   <p>Mo Xie stood up, her eyes shining with resolve. Suddenly speeding up, she swiftly swept through the thorny vines set up by the Bramble Demon, dashing towards the middle of the sandy battleground!</p>
   <p>“Don’t let it get near the moonlight!!” Wang Keluo suddenly remembered the species ability of the Moonlight Fox - Moon Essence. Watching Mo Xie approach the moonlight with blazing speeds, he immediately cried out!</p>
   <p>The Ninth Stage Du Jue and the Eighth Stage Scarlet Scorpion immediately appeared in front of Mo Xie. The Du Jue casted Piercing Drill while the Scarlet Scorpion waved its chain-like stinger to attack Mo Xie!</p>
   <p>“Huhuhuhu!!”</p>
   <p>Just after Mo Xie evaded the attacks from the Du Jue and Scarlet Scorpion, the Wind Fairy’s Whirlwind rolled towards the area!</p>
   <p>“Mo Xie, Dark Assault!”</p>
   <p>Although Mo Xie was already on the verge of exhaustion, she cast Dark Assault while clenching her teeth. With her previous speed and trajectory, Mo Xie would have definitely been tossed up by the Whirlwind. After casting Dark Assault, however, Mo Xie’s speed instantly increased. Under everyone’s bewildered gazes, she scraped past the edge of the raging Whirlwind, and reached the middle of the battlefield!</p>
   <p>The cold and dismal Moonlight was unknowingly veiled by a layer of clouds, causing the moonlight to soften. This clean and beautiful light bathed onto Mo Xie’s body, as if adding a layer of silvery, ornate armour onto this beautiful and demonically charming Moonlight Fox.</p>
   <p>The lighter wounds on her body started slowly healing, and the abdominal wounds caused by the Nido Beast’s charge were also distinctly changing.</p>
   <p>Moonlight was a Moonlight Fox’s best recovery method. The longer it bathed in it, the faster its wounds would heal. Most importantly, under the moonlight, Mo Xie’s physical strength was swiftly recovering as well!</p>
   <p>“Wuwuwu!!! Wuwuwu!!!”</p>
   <p>Standing in the silver light, Mo Xie arrogantly raised her head, howling again and again towards the moon. The mottled shadows casted by the moonlight shaped this cold-hearted fox into a black crescent scythe!</p>
   <p>The howling echoed throughout the battlefield- proud and imposing. From the sound, people could hear that it was the Moonlight Fox’s declaration of battle to all the rest of the soul pets!!</p>
   <p>Declaration of battle! A declaration of battle towards the remaining six soul pets!</p>
   <p>Mo Xie’s unrestrained recklessness again silenced the crowd!</p>
   <p>No one would have thought that a Moonlight Fox, known for its beauty and glamor, would have such a wild and demonically imposing side!</p>
