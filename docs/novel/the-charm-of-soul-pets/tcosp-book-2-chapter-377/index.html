It was as if they were about to be extinguished by the violent wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the devil flame, Chu Mu and Ting Lan’s bodies gradually appeared.</span></p>

Just now, the tenth rank wind type force had wantonly poured down his throat and nearly suffocated him. Fortunately, his body was stronger than normal people, otherwise when he had just been completely sealed off in the wind pillar just now, he would have been unable to use Displacement Specter and been completely swallowed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan had her eyes tightly shut. When the tenth rank wind technique had completely sealed them off, she had felt a genuine threat of death. Right now, her mind was blank, and she was grabbing onto Chu Mu’s arm purely out of instinct, waiting for her body to be ripped apart by the violent wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Open your eyes, we’re safe.” Chu Mu said as he looked down at Ting Lan who was trembling from fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Chu Mu’s voice, Ting Lan finally slowly opened her eyes. Unexpectedly, on the corners of her eyes was a bit of moisture...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearness of death was a fear that was hard to describe with words. Ting Lan wasn’t Chu Mu, and was unable to remain calm and cool near the face of death and when she opened her eyes, her eyes were filled with tears. She fraily gasped for air and wasn’t much different from a normal girl who had been frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, Ting Lan’s hazy field of view allowed her to discover that they hadn’t been swept into the tenth rank wind type technique and her constant palpitating heart slowly began to calm down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re…. We’re ok? How… how did you do it?” Ting Lan raised her gratified face as her tear-filled eyes looked at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu remembered that when the wind pillar had been completely sealed off, they were still in the technique. Just as she thought she was definitely dead and closed her eyes, this ability that seemed to be able to instantaneously teleport unexpectedly brought her away from this tenth rank Wind Pillar which made her feel despair. Aside from the happiness from surviving a calamity in her heart, she was also astonished by this man’s mysterious ability!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s not talk about this. Li Hen should have been able to escape. Let’s leave this place.” Chu Mu naturally wouldn’t explain the White Nightmare’s technique, Displacement Specter, and changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan’s mind was a bit of a mess right now, so she didn’t continue asking him after Chu Mu had changed the topic and she somewhat loosened her grip on Chu Mu’s arm...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tenth rank wind type technique was not too far behind them and no one could be sure whether this technique would ravage outwards. It would thus be better to stay further away from this place. Promptly, Chu Mu chanted an incantation and summoned the Night Thunder Dream Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huh? Careful!!!” suddenly, Ting Lan let out a delicate shout. Her eyes stared with fear at the eighth phase high stage Binding Wind Spirit chasing them from within the tenth rank wind type technique!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Ting Lan shouted, Chu Mu instantly noticed a powerful wind type technique sweeping at his back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of Chu Mu’s techniques, none of them were wind type defense techniques. Moreover, continuing to chant to summon the Night Thunder Dream Beast would be useless. He could only cut off his incantation and summon the Ghost King King in order to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this amount of time wasn’t enough for Chu Mu to rechant a summoning incantation. An incomparably powerful ninth rank technique was quickly about to crush his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan realized that Chu Mu wouldn’t be able to defend in time, and hastily closed her eyes as she rapidly chanted a soul technique incantation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black turbid wind began spiraling under Chu Mu and Ting Lan’s feet. The spiraling speed grew faster and faster before ultimately transforming into a turbid wind shield that coiled around them and protected them in the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My… my technique cannot completely defend a ninth rank wind type technique. Hold… hold onto me tightly. My eighth level soul armor can protect you.” Ting Lan presently wasn’t able to deal with the male and female distinction as freeing themselves from this predicament was the most important. She thus took the initiative to hold onto Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eighth level soul armor?” Chu Mu was stunned and didn’t expect Ting Lan to have this eminently luxurious eighth level soul armor. It was no wonder she was able to only suffer a light wound from a tenth phase Hurricane Fairy’s attack without any defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the eighth level soul armor was to protect two people, it would not be able to cover them completely. When Chu Mu tightly held onto Ting Lan, the eighth rank soul armor merely protected his head and neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hu hu hu hu hu hu!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The acute sound of whistling wind was in his ears and Chu Mu could feel countless pairs of wind hands using force to pushing him upwards whilst also madly ripping at his body. This pain was as if his flesh and skin were being ripped apart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, Chu Mu and Ting Lan were unable to stay on the ground, and were fiercely tossed into the air by the ninth rank wind type technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ninth rank wind type technique was terrifying and in the air, Chu Mu was unable to hold onto Ting Lan. A little while later, they separated and the two of them tossed about by the wild ninth rank wind like weeds and were swept towards unknown territories…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the entire boundless wind zone, a human body was too small. The ninth rank wind type technique threw them a hundred meters up into the air before they began to flow with the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan’s situation was alright with the protection of the eighth level soul armor. Chu Mu, however, was wearing a sixth level soul armor, and its defense was completely negligible in the ninth rank wind type technique. If Chu Mu’s body hadn’t been imperceptably changed by the half devil, when he separated with Ting Lan, Chu Mu would have been ripped to shreds by the wind type technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful wind type technique carried a certain dizziness effect and in the ravaging violent wind, Chu MU finally lost consciousness. He was still unconscious even when he fell from the flowing streams of air and fell to the ground…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

Several tearing scars had appeared on his body and he seemed abnormally wretched.</span></p>

Alone in the entire boundless wind zone was a figure lying on the extremely dry ground. It was motionless and didn’t seem to have any signs of life...</span></p>
