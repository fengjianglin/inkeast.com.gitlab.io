 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The real competition will take place two days from now. Liu Binglan was busy settling the matters regarding the Territory Institution and the Zhengming Main City’s branch palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Shen Mo also went along with her as Liu Binglan had intended to let Shen Mo handle the matter of the Zhengming Main City’s branch palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo was not really strong in a battle, but his management ability was excellent. He was stable and calm, and was very suitable to be a palace master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Shen Mo was still a little too young for that. Liu Binglan would also dispatch a few experienced elders along with him who were more familiar with the Zhengming Main City to assist Shen Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the following two days, Chu Mu surprisingly did not cultivate and put all his effort on accompanying Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had never handled matters in regards to the New Moon Land, so he seemed to be rather free from other people’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu also was not familiar with what coaxing meant. He just stood there wherever Ye Qingzi was. Since he was the one who had made a mistake, it was necessary for him to be the one lowering his posture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was always followed around by Ning Maner. With her around, the mood between the two of them did not become too stiff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, when night arrived though, Chu Mu would keep finding chances to be alone with Ye Qingzi, regardless of whether she was willing to or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation between them had become much better these past two days. At least Ye Qingzi was not completely ignoring him. He knew that she was just in a fit of pique. If things had really become unsalvageable, then she would have already left quietly long ago, not giving him any chances to coax her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next day the match between the top four would be taking place. Chu Mu had finally gotten to sleep on the same bed with Ye Qingzi. The only regret was that Ye Qingzi had forbade him from going any further than that. Chu Mu could only hug her and sleep obediently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The day of the competition between the top four had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s sudden appearance had heavily stirred up the originally almost guaranteed champion ranking. Many people had begun guessing on whether that New Moon Land King had truly displayed his full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first match taking place would be Chu Mu vs Han Erxing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing had been waiting with anticipation for a long time. After the match schedule was revealed, he curved up the corner of his lips and said, “I was really worried if he would encounter you two. I won’t be getting a chance to teach him a lesson if that were to happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His battle beast Mo Ye is very strong. It may not be inferior in strength to your Heaven Horn Beast after completely powering up. You better be careful out there,” reminded Xin Xin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think that I will give it a chance to slowly increase its power?” snorted Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The greatest weakness of that battle beast Mo Ye was that it was weak at the beginning. If it could be suppressed, &nbsp;then it was only a soul pet that was a little more powerful than a peak Dominator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re right,” Xin Xin nodded, then glanced at Tang Zhuo and spoke, “Looks like he won’t be getting a chance to fight against you. Of course, if you were to purposely lose to me, then you will get a chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo was indifferent to the matter. If Han Erxing could defeat Chu Mu, then that meant that Chu Mu was no match for him from the beginning. Although Han Erxing and Xin Xin were ranked similar to him, there was still some difference in actual strength between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“First match, New Moon Land Chu Mu vs Divine Sect Han Erxing,” announced the middle-aged main referee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu entered the Hovering Mountain Battlefield and took a curious glance at the main referee who had a black beard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main referee of the match was Mu Xie, an Immortal rank expert belonging to the Mu Family Dynasty. In truth, he had sworn allegiance to Yu Suo, hence Guo Shi was coldly humiliated by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi did not dare to show up in the public anymore. For some reason, he had received loathing looks from countless people in the Zhengming Main City, be it from either the strong or the weak. Guo Shi’s reputation was utterly ruined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, Han Erxing also flew into the battlefield. When the two of them stood on separate Hovering Mountains and started glaring at each other, loud cheers broke out from the various Hovering Mountain spectator seats. This battle was clearly one of those that were anticipated by many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was a sudden black horse. A competition without any element of suspense could not excite the spectators no matter how brilliant the performance of the participants was. Only when such irregularities like Chu Mu mixed into the competition making the outcome totally unpredictable could it truly make a competition worth watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prepare yourselves,” said the main referee Mu Xie calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing nodded towards the main referee, indicating that he had completed his preparations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Erxing had quite an average look, with a bit of a patch of freckles on his face..However, that did not affect his gaze from overflowing with a superior attitude. Regardless of the Divine Sect that he represented or his own strength, he truly had the qualification to look down on others. Even some of the old Immortal rank experts would have to show some respect in front of a young outstanding expert with unlimited potential like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was impossible to just rely on a vast quantity of resources to support themselves in order to reach such a level. Without going through harsh training, his soul pets would die during a battle no matter how high their ranks were. Talent, background, chance encounter and luck, all of these factors were necessary. Only by gathering all of them together, would a person gain a chance to stand at the peak of the human domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this era of the youth, he would be standing at the peak of the youths. In the next era, he would be standing at the peak of humanity. With such potential and resources, there was no need for him to pretend to be equal with the commoners, let alone tolerating someone who had offended him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re really helplessly foolish. Do you know that if I wanted to kill you, then you would have been a corpse on the street by now?” Han Erxing sneered in disdain and calmly spoke, “But I did not do that, because I must let you know that you are nothing before me even without me using the Divine Sect’s power!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Han Erxing said this, Chu Mu came to a sudden realization. So it was Han Erxing’s subordinates who had kept following him and Ye Qingzi when they were out strolling. Those subordinates appeared to be quite strong as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Han Erxing should be the one feeling glad that they did not make a move. Otherwise, it would not be Chu Mu who would lay fallen on the street, but those wicked Divine Sect members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not make a rebuttal. After his mood was lifted up in the past two days, he now maintained his usual attitude by not trash talking before a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took a glance at the main referee Mu Xie and was just about to indicate that he had also finished his preparation. However, he had suddenly felt a warm flash in his Spatial Ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was startled for a moment and he quickly probed his soul remembrance into the soul pet space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The warm flash had precisely come from the Monument Tears!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was in possession of ten droplets of Monument Tears. In the past, Chu Mu had always thought that after using the tear crystal, the Monument Tear would also automatically disappear. He only realized later on that each droplet of the tear would leave behind a mark in that tiny container. It clearly meant that the Monument Tears have never disappeared, they had only lost their energy temporarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had obtained his ninth Monument Tear while on the Yellow Spring Road. That droplet of tear belonged to Night. It had wandered within the vast Eternal Ocean all by itself &nbsp;looking for the Demonic Burial Mound. After entering the Demonic Burial Mound, it was heavily riddled with wounds for the sake of the King in its heart. It did not give up on its faith even after it had turned into a spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That droplet of the Monument Tear truly had a rather deep place in Chu Mu’s heart. Even if their soul contract was broken, it still turned into a very precious droplet of Monument Tear and it stayed in the container.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tenth Monument Tear was Ning Maner’s tear. It actually did not originally belong to Chu Mu. However, Ning Maner was not a Monument Tear Individual. Chu Mu who had a soul contract with it had obtained her Monument Tear through its experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, there were a total of ten Monument Tears in his possession. Chu Mu did not know whether having ten was many or few to a qualified Monument Tear Individual......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Monument Tears that had always been staying quietly in that tiny ancient container. It would only gain the warmth of a tear when it was obtaining new Monument Tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu had clearly &nbsp;not obtained any new Monument Tear this time, yet they had started glowing as if they had received the summon of something!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master, it’s a Monument Tear Individual! There is another Monument Tear Individual here in this Hovering Mountain Battlefield!” reminded Old Li hurriedly using a mental voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li’s reminder had snapped Chu Mu back to reality. His black eyes immediately scanned through the entire Hovering Mountain Battlefield to find the person who was also similarly possessing Monument Tears and was acknowledged by the Heaven Boundary Monument.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that Chu Mu had encountered a Monument Tear Individual. According to Ning Maner, every Monument Tear Individual had astonishing potential. Their stories would definitely be long and filled with many hardships. They were individuals who were chosen by the Heaven Boundary Monument according to the memories recorded from the Monument Tears &nbsp;were currently the strongest or the most likely to become the strongest in future!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, the other Monument Tear Individuals should not be inferior to Chu Mu. The hardships that they had experienced would not fall short of Chu Mu's own. Since they were still alive, then they definitely were in possession of great strength. Tang Zhuo, Han Erxing or Xin Xin could not even hold a candle against them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you sense his position?” asked Old Li anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each Monument Tear Individual possessed a portion of a memory given by the Monument Tear. Connecting all these memories together would reveal a complete story. This story recorded the strongest creatures and strongest race within ten thousand years. Whether they still existed in this world, how did they advance into Undying Realm, and did they leave behind any treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the hidden history that was sealed in the Heaven Boundary Monument could be revealed, then it would be equivalent to directly finding a method to step into the Undying Realm. Although the Immortal rank was the current peak of humanity, countless Immortal rank experts were desperately seeking a way to successfully advance into the Undying Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t, he seems to be stronger than me,” Chu Mu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being similar Monument Tear Individuals, the Monument Tears could only inform Chu Mu that there was a similar individual nearby. However, Chu Mu could not find that specific individual among the fully occupied venue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It better not be a Fake Monument Tear Individual, otherwise you will be in big trouble if you were to be exposed,” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook his head and spoke, “He also should &nbsp;not be able to find me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That may not really be the case. You are on the battlefield right now, he has a greater chance of finding you,” said Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu became more cautious. He hoped that it was not a Fake Monument Tear Individual. Otherwise, it would be a pain to get targeted by an individual who was maddened by the desire to supersede life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s gaze turned to the Saintess seat on the main Hovering Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yu Suo, a Monument Tear Individual has appeared,” said Chu Mu with his mental voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo was shocked for a moment, then immediately asked Chu Mu only two key questions, “Did you notice it in the previous match? Which direction do you roughly sense it from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not in the previous match, probably south of me, between the Hovering Mountain 10 to 15,” answered Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Hovering Mountain seats were strictly restricted by levels. Basically, every seat was fixed, especially the seats that were near the front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, if they could find out the change in the spectator flow, then they could roughly ascertain the identity of that Monument Tear Individual. Chu Mu believed that the surveillance network of Yu Suo had spread everywhere and could locate that Monument Tear Individual.</span></p>
