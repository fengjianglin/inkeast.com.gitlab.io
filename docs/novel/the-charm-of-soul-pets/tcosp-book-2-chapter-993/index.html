 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had just reunited with Liu Binglan when he heard about the bad news about Ning Maner from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu had returned to Wanxiang City, he hadn’t felt a spiritual fluctuation from her, making him feel strange. He figured she was in some restricted area, playing around. He didn’t realize that she had been taken away by people from the Dark Sky Ocean World.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had signed a soul pact with this girl, so her being taken away left a bitter feeling in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu spent a long time talking with Liu Binglan and gave her an approximate account of what happened. Liu Binglan had already heard Ye Qingzi tell her this before, but as a mother, she wanted to hear it from Chu Mu himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s version was had obviously taken out any of the dangers he was in. Nonetheless, after undergoing the devil transformation, Chu Mu was no longer as weak as before. He wouldn’t constantly be in danger…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they talked, the topic arrived at Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s encountered a bit of trouble.” Liu Binglan had come to know this daughter in law of hers for a year now. She was rather satisfied with her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What trouble?” Chu Mu wasn’t very happy about this. He had left for a year, and in this period of time, someone found trouble for her?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She wanted to help me concoct a few spirit items. I went with her to the Eastern Wild Forest and encountered a wounded person deep in the forest. Out of kindness, she helped heal that person and his soul pet. Somehow he managed to find out that Qingzi was in Soul Palace and often comes here…” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Chu Mu more or less understood what was happening. The person who Ye Qingzi had saved out of kindness went so far as to court Qingzi. That was something, eh. He absolutely had to trample on this fellow!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is that person?” asked Chu Mu with a blank face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This person is a bit of trouble…” said Liu Binglan. If it was someone normal, Liu Binglan could get rid of him herself. There was no need to wait until now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But why would it be troublesome for Chu Mu? Even if that person was the Hero Chief, Chu Mu would still make him understand that his woman couldn’t be provoked just like that!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s called Wu Kuang. If I’m correct, he should be the Alliance Master’s disciple. In Wanxiang City, he is called the Son of Heaven. He is the most outstanding person in the younger generation.” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu slightly creased his brows. He never expected it to be the mysterious and unfathomable disciple of the Alliance Master who Teng Lang had told him about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Was it a coincidence or intentional?” Chu Mu immediately asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that after he defeated the Fourth Hero Mo Ling, he would probably be followed closely by a lot of people. There was even a chance he could be noticed by the powerful and unknown Alliance Master. If the Alliance Master had sent the Son of Heaven, Wu Kuang, to follow Ye Qingzi in order to inquire about him, this would be troublesome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Alliance Master could be suppressed by the Holy Region’s Seven Saint Kings, Chu Mu could only single control right now. The Dead Dream’s phase also hadn’t been raised yet. If they were to fight, he would be be in trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was just a coincidence, then this would be a matter of that man being jealous of a rival in a love affair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It should just be a coincidence. When we entered the depths of Wild Forest, there was a spring there where experts often rest. After washing away our fatigue, we encountered him there and the wound on his body was real.” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Liu Binglan had known that person was the Alliance Master’s disciple, Wu Kuang, she definitely would have gotten rid of him. Liu Binglan couldn’t afford to allow a person who could threaten her child survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan would be able to kill him in the wild, but once back in Wanxiang City, she no longer dared. Indeed, this person was the Alliance Master’s disciple who was someone who could change the entire situation with a single movement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it’s a coincidence, then it’s fine.” Since it was a coincidence, Chu Mu didn’t need to worry too much. He would still beat him up since he was also a young generation member. As long as he didn’t kill him, it wouldn’t affect the general situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Teng Lang had told him before that in the subsequent period of time, there would probably be a contest between the young generation. Since the Son of Heaven had appeared in Wanxiang City, this fellow would probably challenge him, who had already shown his ability. Only, he had an extra reason to hate him because of Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan wasn’t well-positioned to handle this so she endorsed Chu Mu’s decision to deal with it &nbsp;himself. However, she told him to be careful because the Son of Heaven’s strength was definitely above Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Liu BInglan’s relationship couldn’t be known to the public, so he didn’t stay long before leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to his courtyard, Chu Mu’s powerful sense of smell managed to pick up the fragrance from Ye Qingzi when she would walk through it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was the most familiar with this fragrance. It was a mix of fresh flowers, both alluring and fresh. It would always intoxicate Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After walking past the front courtyard, Chu Mu made his way to the back medicine garden. He spotted the sexy and bewitching Ye Qingzi crouched over a flower medicine. She was carefully examining the growth of the plant and her small red lips were muttering something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was like a phantom that silently reached Ye Qingzi’s back. Yet, he heard her mutter, “If Ning Maner was here, it would be good. These spirit plants are growing so slow…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s lips curved into a wicked smile. His hand silently reached towards Ye Qingzi’s ass and he abruptly grabbed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah!” Ye Qingzi jumped in fright and let out a delicate cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when the familiar scent reached her nose, her heart began to beat quickly like a small deer and her face instantly turned red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lovely smile blossomed on her beautiful face. The colorful and fresh spirit grass and flowers paled in comparison. She lovingly turned around and looked at the handsome face still with a wicked smile…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you think of me?” Chu Mu hugged her thin and flexible waist, and asked her with his head pressed against her smooth forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Ye Qingzi nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long period of time away, their feelings for each other were even stronger. Seeing Ye Qingzi’s increasingly beautiful and moving figure, Chu Mu couldn’t help but be entranced. He tilted his head down and his lips planted on Ye Qingzi’s red lips. He would have a passionate kiss with her before they continued talking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s thin arm was already wrapped around Chu Mu’s neck, holding him tightly. She gave a &nbsp;slightly embarrassed response to Chu Mu’s mouth of a wolf… &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scoundrel… not here!” as they were passionately kissing, Ye Qingzi suddenly felt something and she feigned anger. Her face was already flushed red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, there’s no one here. Trust my dominator rank perception.” Chu Mu’s lust had been triggered and couldn’t care less where this was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi small fists punched Chu Mu’s chest. This was what this fellow used his dominator rank strength for?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimately, Chu Mu was unable to convince his conservative wife. He picked her up and glanced at the room…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silver colored devil flame ignited on Chu U and Ye Qingzi. Chu Mu couldn’t wait any longer and didn’t hesitate to use Displacement Specter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flames burned over his entire body, even igniting the love and desire in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tonight would probably be a sleepless night…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the morning when golden rays of sunshine spilled into the white wintery courtyard, the morning dew sparkled in the beautiful light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A young servant girl was carrying hot water and lightly knocked on the door from outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Xin, bring it later.” Chu Mu heard the door and quickly sent her away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a long while before he had slept so comfortably. Chu MU was lying under the cosy cover and in his arms was the sleeping Ye Qingzi whose face was a rosy red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had already woken up. Normally, the two of them were used to waking up early to work hard, but today they were lazing around in bed and weren’t willing to get up. The night of passion clearly wasn’t enough to satisfy the yearning they had for each other in the past year.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them just lay there talking. After speaking many words of love, gradually, the topic shifted to Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“About Ning Maner…” Ye Qingzi softly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, tell me what happened.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to this topic, Ye Qingzi’s heart contained anger. Promptly, she told Chu Mu about those people who kidnapped Ning Maner at night and the extremely arrogant and ruthless Border Guard who subsequently appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Chu Mu finished listening, his eyes became extremely cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person had been so arrogant as to tell him, the guardian, to go to the Dark Sky Ocean World to find him for revenge. What Chu Mu couldn’t stand the most was that he had used the lives of the White Nightmares and Ye Qingzi into forcing Ning Maner to willingly follow them back!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is Third White?” Chu Mu said in a low voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I saved him, but its abilities have been completely lost…” Ye Qingzi was only able to save Third White whose life force was rather tough. The other White Nightmares had all perished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about First White and the others?” Chu Mu’s heart sank and he continued inquiring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“First White and the others are fine. They are currently training hard in the Nightmare Holy Region. They were waiting for you to return. You only need to tell them that you’re going to the Dark Sky Ocean World and they will immediately round up a Nightmare army from the small Southern Forbidden Region and the large Southern Forbidden Region to kill their way over there.” said Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was unable to swallow this, especially when she thought of the Border Commander’s arrogant words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Border Commander Zheng Wu!” Chu Mu firmly remembered this name!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After dealing with the matters here, Chu Mu would fly over to the Dark Sky Ocean World and raze whatever area Zheng Wu was in!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky above the Wanxiang Altar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mighty and imposing White Tiger was stepping on the clouds in the sky. Its icy pupils were staring down at the Queen’s Palace situated high up.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Wanxiang Altar should have belonged to the Mu Family. However, even the final Queen’s Palace had changed masters, becoming the territory of Eight Desolations Fang Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi stood next to the White Tiger, staring down at the person who had sold her out and stolen her palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tai, go down.” Mu Qingyi jumped onto the White Tiger’s back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger didn’t step its way down. Instead, it shot straight down!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its white mighty body fell from the blue sky and white clouds. The Queen’s Palace was defenseless right now and they abruptly landed in front of the palace!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beng!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incomparably sturdy crystal rocks on the ground were shattered and the servant girls and servants who were busily moving in and out of the palace jumped in fright. They all fell backwards to the ground and stared with shock at the White Tiger with godly might and the woman with cold dignity - even more cold than chilled ice - who sat on top!&nbsp;</span></p>
