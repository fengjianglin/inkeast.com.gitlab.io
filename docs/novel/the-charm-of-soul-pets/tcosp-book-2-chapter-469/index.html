 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Chu Mu never expected to encounter the defector young lady in the seventh realm, nor did he expect her to be a competitor in the Battle of the Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been an entire 12 years since he had seen the defector young lady. The resentment in his heart had already manifested into a chilling killing intent. His gaze was like a sword that coldly pierced into the defector young lady’s pupils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defector young lady’s face was covered by a veil. Her eyes weren’t as full of life as Chu Mu had seen in his dream. Instead, they gave a vacuous feeling, devoid of any emotions. It was like a body without any soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she looked at Chu Mu, it was like she was looking somewhere else. This feeling made Chu Mu extremely uncomfortable; it was as if he was being ignored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys can leave.” the defector young lady waved her hand, indicating that the three people beside her should retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three others didn’t dare question it, and respectfully retreated to the other side of the flat mountain peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The violent gale whistled high up, blowing the defector young lady’s long hair into a disheveled state. She stepped forward, taking one step at a time towards Chu Mu...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu looked at her. For some reason, as the defector young lady neared, Chu Mu was unable to sense her aura at all. It was an extremely strange feeling, as he had never encountered this feeling from any life form before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defector young lady slowly walked past Chu Mu. With her back to Chu Mu, she faced the distant meandering mountain range, looking on as the violent wind ceaselessly blew in her face. She didn’t say a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, she’s extremely strange. Be prepared at any moment to have the White Nightmare fight.” Old Li used soul remembrance to warn Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Li knew that Chu Mu had intentionally let himself be captured, but his intuition told him that this defector young lady wasn’t just a little bit strange; yet, he wasn’t able to discern why she was strange. Instead, this made Old Li worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu forcibly suppressed the emotions his heart. As Old Li felt the strangeness, Chu Mu himself realized that the veiled woman in front of him was only similar to the defector young woman in external appearance. Her gaze, temperament and perception was different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Withdraw from the Battle of the Realm.” finally, the defector young woman opened her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice was very empty and soulless. It sounded like the unstable whisper of a wind. If one didn’t listen carefully, he or she wouldn’t be able to tell she was talking...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t her.” Chu Mu creased his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t obstruct me. If you obstruct me, I’ll kill even you.” the defector young woman continued to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Hmph, only a puppet. You had me all excited for no reason.” Chu Mu disappointedly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no soul connection. The veiled woman in front was only had the external appearance and part of the aura of the defector young woman. However, she definitely wasn’t the defector young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Chu Mu hadn’t entered the Sacred Holy Region, perhaps he would have confused this intuition; however, when he had entered the dream realm, Chu Mu obtained an even deeper level of understanding towards the defector young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defector young woman was a person undeniably full of life, and looked like a perfect fairy. She had a special soul, her eyes were so beautiful they would intoxicate others and her expression was capable of impacting a person’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body radiated with a holy aura, and even someone who possessed the deepest hatred towards her and had heightened his vigilance would still be unable to resist her charm. Her charm wasn’t a pretty and flirtatious kind. Instead, it was the most pure form of female charm. However, the veiled woman in front of him was merely a shell of the defector young lady. Aside from her delicate body, she possessed not one bit of the defector young woman’s temperament; she didn’t even have a soul…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whether I’m her or not isn’t important. I only want to tell you not to obstruct me. This time is just a warning.” emptily said the veiled woman,&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Listening to the veiled woman’s words, Chu Mu suddenly really wanted to laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A warning. A puppet of his own soul pet wanted to warn him? This truly was absurd in the soul pet world and Chu Mu suddenly felt the absurdity of it all!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is she?” sneered Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bring Princess Jin Rou in front of me, and I’ll let you safely back out of the Battle of the Realm. If you’re determined to continue, then don’t blame me for killing you as well.” the veiled woman in front of him didn’t respond to his question, instead indifferently telling him something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu took a few deep breaths in an attempt to pacify the emotions in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Before this, I didn’t wish anything more than to immediately undo our soul pact. However, right now, even if it comes to after the Battle of the Realm, I would refuse to undo the soul pact.” said Chu Mu in an arrogant voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s up to you. In any case, your weak soul isn’t able to influence my actions at all, let alone control her.” said the veiled young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of Chu Mu’s mouth faintly twitched as he said: “Is that the case? My weak soul is unable to control her or influence her at all?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many cases when purely possessing ego and a feeling of responsibility will not do. You must have strength, which you simply don’t have. Just like in this seventh realm. Your ability was limited to merely killing a few weak killers. Even right now, all I have to do is think of it and I can have you immediately killed. There’s only one path of survival for you right now. So throw away your ridiculous dignity and happily accept this path. Otherwise, there will only be the path of death for you. If I don’t kill you, you’ll die if you continue. I’m actually saving you right now.” the veiled woman’s tone became colder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The veiled woman’s words carried a cold prick that pierced Chu Mu’s body. The defector young woman’s temperament made it very hard for others to link her to an extremely vile and evil soul. However, she was really just a woman whose external appearance was the complete opposite of her heart. This could be seen from the words of this female puppet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She put herself high up on a pedestal, and saw others as lowly filthy things that could be trampled on as she pleased. She didn’t even remember the pitiful state she had pretended to be in when she had begged to sign a soul pact with him. It was her that was an even more lowly and filthy creature!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, I can’t listen anymore either. If we don’t capture this woman, peel off her falsely beautiful exterior and throw her into the soul devil flames to burn hundreds of thousands of times, it’ll be hard to resolve the hatred in your heart!!” Old Li’s angry voice transmitted to him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Li was usual cowardly and afraid. However, today, he truly couldn’t bear this puppet of Chu Mu’s soul pet using such a tone to talk to Chu Mu!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He silently grit his teeth: don’t irritate young master, or even if he underwent the devil transformation, he would let his young master become a half devil. Young master would hen use his claws to rip this puppet of the defector young woman into pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did I say something wrong? She wanted to save you out of the goodness of her heart.” The veiled face finally turned around and looked at him face to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was shocked because the expression on Chu Mu’s face wasn’t the forced suppression of anger that she had imagined; instead, it was a pure ice-cold smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This smile rendered an uncomfortable feeling all over the veiled woman’s body. It was as if he was standing on an even higher place looking down on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you smiling for?” Asked the veiled woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The veiled woman was emotionless when she spoke and her face was also expressionless. However, it was possible to feel the contempt she had towards Chu Mu.</span></p>

He believed that just because he had signed a soul pact with her that he was her master. What was ridiculous was that his weak soul pact simply had no power to terminate itself. Moreover, she had never seen this soul pact as a slave-master relation!</span></p>

You have no idea what lowly and despicable is. Lowly and despicable isn’t determined by species rank or strength. I’ll tell that woman that today, her high and mighty good heartedness is just another form of humiliation; that’s the way I see it. Adding on the things from the past, I, Chu Mu, will return it ten-fold to her!!” sneered Chu Mu.</span></p>

Only by destroying her glorified and arrogant ideals and fiercely trampling over her dignity could one make her understand how stupid her words today were!</span></p>

She coldly harrumphed: “Don’t waste my time!”</span></p>

Then, he had Mo Xie and Princess Jin Rou meet up to capture Shen Yicheng!&nbsp;</span></p>

At that moment, Chu Mu’s heart had intensely beated because if the veiled woman was Princess Jin Rou, then him and Mo Xie would have fallen into the enemy’s hands. Fortunately, they weren’t the same person. He had over thought things.</span></p>
