 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It really was Yellow Springs. It was extremely difficult to see Yellow Springs in the human realm. At least Chu Mu had never seen a soul pet trainer with one of the five great undying species. This exemplified how difficult it was to sign a soul pact with one of these five species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, these five great undying species had their own civilization. They were also the rulers of this civilization and prosperous nation. They couldn’t rely on someone else’s charity and their status was higher than humans. Therefore, this made it hard for humans to sign soul pacts with these five species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chu Mu didn’t have Mo Xie who had the special mutation ability that mutated her into a Hades Fox Noble, Chu Mu wouldn’t have any opportunity to obtain the interest of the five great undying species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was lacking a water type soul pet, and if he was able to sign a soul pact with a Yellow Springs, he wouldn’t have any regrets in his soul pet trainer life!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what were Yellow Springs like?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hades were the supreme bloodline of the Demon Fox species. So what species were Yellow Springs the supreme bloodline of? Was it the Water Unicorn species, the Turtle Species, the Ocean Demon species, the Shark species, or the Flood Dragon species? Or perhaps they were a hybrid of all the first-rate species?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like you’re very interested in Yellow Springs?” the mermaid princess slowly swam over from her throne. Her body lithely drifted over to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The currents lightly brushed against her lustrous body. The gorgeous eroticism couldn’t help but make one want to look more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big brother!!” Ning Maner exasperatedly and flusteredly glared at Chu Mu. Where was this pervert looking at? What was there even to look at? Wasn’t it just more flesh there? Moreover, wasn’t such a big mermaid princess afraid of water resistance when she swam? Ning Maner was angrily thinking about all of this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t disturb,” Chu Mu removed Ning Maner’s two small pinching fingers from his arm. This girl was always pinching him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not allowed to look! Close your eyes!” said Ning Maner. As she spoke, she stood on her tiptoes and used her small white hands to block his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was speechless towards her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess watched Ning Maner’s adorable actions and giggled. She said: “Is this your girlfriend? How cute.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister, you must wear clothes. Big brother is a pervert.” Ning Maner didn’t let the issue go.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those are customs of you humans. Us mermaids all like to reveal our beautiful parts to those we like. Little sister, you can also reveal the places you’re most proud of. Perhaps your good older brother wouldn’t look at me anymore and instead just look at you,” the mermaid princess laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner’s face instantly flushed red as she muttered: “How can I do that.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess faintly smiled. She stopped joking around this topic with Ning Maner. She swam up to Chu Mu and used her hand to lightly touch his forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment, the mermaid princess’s beauty was fully exposed before Chu Mu’s eyes. Chu Mu wanted to suck in a deep breath, but discovered he was underwater.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the beautiful mermaid species was full of alluring women. Right now he had to try his hardest to focus on her lower half and cut off those thoughts he shouldn’t be having.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are a human soul pet trainer?” the mermaid princess used her finger to lightly move the hair on Chu Mu’s forehead as she softly asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve heard that you humans have the ability to tame other species? I think they were called soul pacts?” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed, I already have many soul pets and they have followed me. Together we have grown, cultivated, and fought,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you show this ability to me? I want to know why it can make these creatures fight for you humans.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Show? You’re talking about the soul pact?” Chu Mu didn’t really know how to show.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Use your soul pact on me.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” before Chu Mu responded, Ning Maner helped him refuse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was going to sign a soul pact with the mermaid princess?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner would refuse under any circumstance. Who knew what kind of naughty things he would do when this beautiful and sexy mermaid princess became the soul pet of this bad big brother!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, younger human sister. Don’t worry. I won’t randomly become the subordinate of a human. I only what to know special form this ability comes from. Don’t be jealous.” the mermaid princess laughed. Although species were different, the intelligent mermaid princess was clearly able to see Ning Maner’s jealousy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not jealous. I’m helping big sister watch over him,” earnestly said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok ok, this works too,” the mermaid princess laughed in response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the mermaid princess was interested in understanding soul pacts, Chu Mu used it on her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deep blue star-like light landed on the mermaid princess. It was like opening a bridge to the soul. In that instant, Chu Mu felt as if he could see the mermaid princess’s memories. However, they were vague and indistinct scenes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess could also see fragments of Chu Mu’s memories. Because it was Chu Mu that had opened his soul to her, she was able to see far more than Chu Mu was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And for some reason, the memories gave the mermaid princess a renewed understanding of this unfamiliar human. It was like he was a very close friend or even a family member that one was unable to part with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess realized that if she allowed the soul pact to continue reaching in, she would actually become this human’s soul pet. Thus, she hastily resisted, and kept Chu Mu’s soul pact at bay.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once it was held at bay, the feeling of closeness slowly grew indistinct and she returned to normal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How dangerous…” the mermaid princess hugged her large and erotic breasts. She spat out a few bubbles from her mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ya, you almost became my soul pet. You shouldn’t have become intoxicated in my memories just now. That caused you to lose yourself. If I had taken a forceful approach just now and made my soul remembrance enter your soul, you would not be able to resist then,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The success rate of a soul pact signing wasn’t very high. However, if the soul pet didn’t have any mental resistance, for example like the mermaid princess when she attempted to accept the soul linkage just now, then the success rate would near 100 percent. If Chu Mu had been shameless, this mermaid princess would have actually become his soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This demonstrated that Chu Mu was an honest person and hadn’t been swayed by the upper half of her body. Indeed, Chu Mu had suffered when he signed his first pact causing him to be extremely cautious in future soul pact signings. He would not sign a soul pact with the envoy of the Ocean Species without reason.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, thank you for being a gentleman. I was too reckless. However, the soul pact ability of you humans is truly special. If we also possessed this ability as well, not as many stupid and stubborn people as now would have appeared. For example, Yellow Springs, which just threw a tantrum.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the soul pact didn’t succeed, the mermaid princess had an even deeper understanding of Chu Mu. She also felt some gratitude and goodwill towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each species has different abilities,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forgive my presumptuousness, but I learned from your soul memories that you are lacking a water type soul pet?” carefully asked the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our Eastern Ocean is currently resisting the enticement and war of the Calamity Ocean Demons. We only have a few adult Yellow Springs in our Eastern Ocean and they aren’t entirely willing to help us. Since you humans have an ability that allows you to create a special soul pact with soul pets, perhaps you can try…” the mermaid princess’s eyes flashed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Try?” Chu Mu felt that he had seized something that made him a bit excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Try and change its views by using your special soul pact method.” said the mermaid princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess’s words immediately made Chu Mu wild with joy!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yellow Springs! Wasn’t this letting him sign a soul pact with Yellow Springs?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If his water type soul pet was Yellow Springs, what was there to be picky about!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of the five great undying species, he already had the Hades Fox Noble. He also had the Evil Good Primogenitor - the flower type soul pet even more ancient than the Limbo Flower. If he obtained the water type supreme, Yellow Springs, Chu Mu would have no regrets if he died!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess’s words made Chu Mu too excited. She was too good at understanding others. He really wanted to kiss her beautiful face and of course, this would be purely to show his thanks!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Human friend, I should explain things first. This Yellow Springs’ status is very high in the Ocean Species. If it wasn’t because it committed a wrong and was demoted… but even if this is the reality, everyone had best not do anything to it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s arrogant and obstinate. It doesn’t even listen to the orders of its own father and mother. It may be young, but it is wanton and violent. The number of disasters it has caused for the Ocean Species is innumerable. My father, the mermaid king, spent a huge amount of effort in order to capture it when it was causing a disaster to a region. When he sought Eternal Ocean Lord for instructions, the lord himself was fed up with it and just ignored it. He handed the matter over to my father to deal with. My father didn’t have any better option and could only lock it up…” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking frankly, this fellow’s influence is not even close to the Calamity Ocean Demon.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. He never expected that Yellow Springs was so capable. Moreover, from Eastern Ocean Princess’s tone, this Yellow Springs was a notorious wild creature amongst the Ocean Species. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The chances of success of signing a soul pact with a soul pet before they reach the seventh phase is rather high. But once a mature soul pet’s consciousness is fully developed, it is very difficult to control or change its consciousness.” Chu Mu rubbed his temples. Given that Yellow Springs was able to rampage through Eternal Ocean, its strength was extremely formidable. There was no way it was an infant Yellow Springs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, no, no, I don’t have any intentions of having you sign a soul pact with it. This arrogant fellow will never sign a soul pact with humans. I only want to use the unique method of humans to guide it. The truth is that we are really in need of its help. Unfortunately, my father has placed it under house arrest and with its temper, not taking revenge on Eastern Ocean already isn’t bad, let alone helping us annihilate the Calamity Ocean Demon army.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid princess thought before adding: “Of course, if you’re able to sign a soul pact with it, we won’t oppose. Once news of it being taken away by a human has spread, the entire Eternal Ocean will thank you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stood there agape. How nasty was this Yellow Springs that the Ocean Species didn’t like it?&nbsp;</span></p>
