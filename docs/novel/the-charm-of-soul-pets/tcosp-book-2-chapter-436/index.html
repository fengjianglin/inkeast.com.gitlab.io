People with a seal of honor possessed the nickname of “Tianxia Ranking Youths” and no matter which kingdom these people went to, they would receive respect and reverence from countless people. They could also make countless factions open their entrances to them and they would possess powers that numerous people were incapable of possessing!&nbsp;</span></p>

Why have I never heard this person’s name before. Such a woman exists in Soul Pet Palace?” numerous people who had come to understand the Tianxia City young experts from the Fengyun Ranking all showed expressions of curiosity.&nbsp;</span></p>

I’ve heard that the true experts don’t use their strength in the first few realms. Everyone all saw in the beast fight that Soul Palace Chu Chen only triple controlled the whole time. Although everyone thinks that he only summoned his main pets, he definitely has held back something. This Soul Palace Xue Qing defeated all of the fighting beasts under quadruple control. Her strength isn’t necessarily stronger than Chu Chen’s.”&nbsp;</span></p>

There were definitely hidden experts in the second grade like Xue Qing who had never appeared before. These people had strength far above his!&nbsp;</span></p>

She suddenly appeared then and defeated the accepted third grade’s strongest, Soul Pet Palace Zhou Qingxing. Back then, that female soul pet trainer had shocked many young experts in Tianxia City, but after that, she didn’t appear at any other occasion. Three years have gone by and she’s already been forgotten. I never expected that three years later, this female talent appeared once again. Moreover, she appeared in the high-key position of first position of the Tianxia Ranking.” said Shang Heng, who came with Chu mu to look at the Tianxia Ranking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Heng hadn’t used his entire strength in the first realm, and had only emblematically made his way into the Tianxia Ranking.

She should have already taken out all her main pets. Otherwise, it would have been very hard to complete in such a short period of time. Chu Chen, although you aren’t first place, the first three places are still the highest honor. Moreover, there’s still the 250 million honor reward.” said Shang Heng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 50 thousand difference wasn’t too painful to swallow for Chu Mu. What he truly cared about, as the Battle of the Realm continued, was those true second grade experts that continuously appeared from behind the scenes!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu planned on conserving the 250 million first and waiting until he gathered the second realm’s honor reward to make 500 million. Then, he would directly purchase a wood attribute spirit item to raise the Devil Tree Battle Soldier from the low class monarch to the middle class monarch.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the earlier realms, Chu Mu felt that there was a chance he would have to reveal himself. In these situations, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier, the Night Thunder Dream Beast, Zhan Ye and the Ghost King all had to rapidly increase their strengths. This way would he have a chance of continuously obtaining the honor rewards in the first few realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After accumulating the rewards, he would have his soul pets try and break into the ninth phase or even higher stages. He would strive to have all his soul pets reach the ninth phase by the time the Battle of the Realms finished. After it was finished, Chu Mu would be able to completely focus on having his soul pets reach the tenth phase perfect form evolution!&nbsp;</span></p>

You are a third grade member, so you can pick the warrior rank difficulty. If you encounter a difficult region, no one will call you out if you go to the third grade and obtain the highest honor there. The highest honor there is 100 million.” Ting Lan faintly smiled as she spoke.</span></p>

The first thirty people in the second grade earn more than the highest honor from the second grade.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>

I should go participate in my second realm elimination round. Are you going to spectate?” Ting Lan gave Chu Mu a warm smile as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were about a few thousand competitors who were listed in this round and they would fight each other to elimination.&nbsp;</span></p>

The three groups would engage in an elimination competition.&nbsp;</span></p>

Two wins and one loss would count as a realm breakthrough success. And if one wanted to obtain an honor reward, his or her name had &nbsp;to be on the Tianxia Ranking before being able to participate in the semi-finals.&nbsp;</span></p>

The top three people after three days and thousands of eliminations would obtain the highest honor of the second realm, and ranking would continue in a similar fashion.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the second realm, she further indicated that she planned on striving for the highest honor.&nbsp;</span></p>

According to Chu Mu’s estimates, she probably had three ninth phase middle class monarchs. It probably wasn’t hard to obtain the highest honor in the second realm’s elimination round. Ting Lan wasn’t very adept at training in the wild, but she probably had a lot of certainty in this round.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was dumbstruck!</span></p>
