 <p>Liu Binglan had seen the Alliance Master before. It was precisely this single-eyed man who had killed Chu Tianmang’s soul pets, sealed his three main pets, and restricted him to the tiny Luo Region!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;It had been so many years since, but the appearance of this man again was like the descent of a killing god!</p>
 <p>“I’ve heard that there is a soul pet trainer who has broken through the spirit emperor realm. Who is it?” calmly said Alliance Master Ling Chan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Binglan knew that the Alliance Master already knew the answer to this. When the Sealed Mouth Event had happened, Chu Tianmang had been restricted, while she herself suffered as well - her soul being sealed for a long amount of time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Originally, Liu Binglan had believed that after the seal was undone, she would be able to recover to her normal state. However, she became exceptionally angry when she discovered that the seal Alliance Master Ling Chan had implemented would actually slowly eat away at her soul!</p>
 <p>It was because of this soul poison that her cultivation speed became abnormally slow. Each time she would break through a remembrance, it would be immediately accompanied with an overflowing soul wound. It would take a long time of recuperation for her soul to heal.</p>
 <p>“Alliance Master, what’s the point in asking a question you know the answer to!” coldly said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Alliance Master Ling Chan’s eyes fell on Liu Binglan. Although it had nearly been 20 years, he wouldn’t forget the successor of the Dawn Supreme. A smile rose on his face: “Then why do you still provoke me even though you clearly know it’s a death crime? Did you really forget those people I killed or crippled in that event?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If I can, I only need to kill one person.” the Alliance Master’s laughter slowly turned cold and he swept his eyes over the experts of the three great palaces. His eyes were filled with indifference and contempt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was nothing to be afraid of in the present three great palaces.</p>
 <p>Liu Binglan looked at the Alliance Master who stood above every soul pet trainer and anger rose in her heart!</p>
 <p>Only needing to kill one person. That person was obviously Chu Mu!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, everyone in the three great palaces knew that once Chu Mu, who could fight against the Four Heroes, was killed, that would be no different to the three great palaces’ destruction. The only person who could fight against the four heroes was Chu Mu. Even the outsider assistance of Mu Qingyi was due to Chu Mu. Once he died, the three great palaces would immediately retreat from Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Alliance Master Ling Chan saw the elders and senior elders from the three great palaces had no intention of retreating, a cruel smile rose on his face: “It seems that I need to kill many then!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The moment he finished speaking, a phantom figure suddenly appeared from under his feet!</p>
 <p>Its body resembled by a mummy as it was wrapped by dark colored cloth. Its head was hidden in the darkness, but the outlines of its three red eyes could be seen!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ghost Eyed Blood Devil Buddhist!!” when the old hermit saw this soul pet appear, he immediately let out a terrified shout!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ghost Eyed Blood Devil Buddhist was the executioner who had harvested the lives of countless experts back then!</p>
 <p>Moreover, this ghost type dominator had an extremely terrifying addiction to first ripping apart all of its opponents blood vessels before admiring their blood spill from their body, as they were immobile, until the blood ran dry. It had to wait for its enemies to become a dried corpse before it ended their lives!</p>
 <p>The Ghost Eyed Blood Devil Buddhist was above ten meters tall. The reason why Ling Chan was standing in the air wasn’t because he was using some levitating technique, but because he was standing on its shoulders. Before the Ghost Eyed Blood Devil Buddhist had shown itself, nobody had realized it was hiding in the dark night!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Its ghost aura was overflowing. Ghost type creatures were extremely rare in Tianxia Realm and Wanxiang Realm. Now that a dominator rank ghost type had appeared, it made the soul pet trainers who were innately fearful of departed spirit world soul pets tremble. Who would want to fight now?!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Binglan, Ke Yin, go and wake the Seven Diagram Saint Pets. Leave this place to us.” said Senior Elder Liu.</p>
 <p>Now that the Alliance Master had appeared and was going to go on a killing spree, Soul Palace had to show its final trump card. Although nobody had expected all this to occur so suddenly, the endless ruins and corpses that littered the ground were incomparably conspicuous. Without a doubt, all this was telling the three great palaces that the catastrophe had already arrived!</p>
 <p>Liu Binglan didn’t say anything more. She knew that she had to wake the Seven Diagram Kings otherwise they would be powerless against the Alliance Master’s strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Binglan didn’t stay here any longer. Riding her Star River, she flew towards the newly constructed main Soul Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of Soul Palace’s god palaces, totems and diagram arrays, including the Holy Region entrances had been moved. Now, the Seven Diagram Saint King totems were in the new Supreme palace. After returning there, one would be able to open the spatial entrance and have the Seven Diagram Saint Kings descend upon Wanxiang City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the Diagram Supreme and Dawn Supreme left, a thousand Supreme holy guards immediately set up the array. In the darkness, it was like golden stars that formed an enormous holy shield array!</p>
 <p>Even if the Alliance Master and the Four Heroes wanted to destroy the defensive fortification of a thousand high ranking holy guards, it would take them a while. The duty of the holy guards was to buy the two Supremes enough time to summon the Seven Diagram Saint Kings!</p>
 <p>Retreat to Soul Pet Palace’s stronghold.” ordered Senior Elder Liu. With the holy shield in front, all of the higher ups urged their soul pets to enter the defensive fortification and were able to retreat to Soul Pet Palace’s stronghold.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soul Pet Palace’s stronghold was situated behind Nightmare Palace and the original Soul Palace. Soul Pet Palace’s stronghold was maintained pretty well and now combined with Soul Palace’s strength, although it would not necessarily be able to withstand Soul Alliance’s army, with Alliance Master Ling Chan participating, it would definitely be able to buy a bit of time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>The big fight could happen at any time so Liu Binglan, the Diagram Supreme, and three accompanying Holy Guard leaders quickly returned to Soul Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Behind them, loud sounds were ringing out and the city was violently trembling after countless techniques bombarded the area.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The moment they entered the palace, Liu Binglan turned around and glanced at the battlefield where continuous vortexes of energy, spatial ripples and elemental explosions occurred. In her eyes, there was a slight trace of pain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They didn’t need a long time to summon the Seven Diagram Saint Kings, but in this period of time, countless members of the three great palaces would die at the hands of the Alliance Master and the Four Heroes!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Mu Qingyi has already arrived. Let’s awaken them as fast as possible.” Diagram Supreme Ke Yin could read the emotions of Liu Binglan and consoled her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Binglan nodded her head. She knew that for each second she delayed, more people would die. Promptly, she stopped her hesitation and entered the palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The moment she did, she and Diagram Supreme suddenly discovered a man standing in the in the corridor they had to walk through. His back was facing them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Binglan was stunned. Faintly, she felt this person was somewhat familiar.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Diagram Supreme Ke Yin’s face was that of joy. This person was Soul Pet Palace’s King, Li Hong!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Li Hong’s strength was probably equivalent to the Hero Aide. With him and Mu Qingyi combining forces, they would probably barely be able to fight against the Four Heroes. Thus, when the Seven Diagram Saint Kings arrived and held down the Alliance Master, although they couldn’t win this sudden battle, they wouldn’t necessarily lose!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Diagram Supreme Ke Yin was thinking about this as he quickly walked up: “Li Hong, you’ve come back just in time!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Li Hong turned around and looked somewhat arrogantly at Diagram Supreme Ke Yin. He slowly nodded his head: “Yes, it’s just in time.”&nbsp;</p>
