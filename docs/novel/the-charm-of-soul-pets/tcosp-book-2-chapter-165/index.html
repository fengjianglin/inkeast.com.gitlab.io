 <p><span style>Chapter 165: Entering Devil Insect Lair (2)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a few eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects flying over, let’s start fighting.” Zhang Qian pointed at a spacious structure ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This structure originally seemed to be a gathering for the aristocrats. From the outer shape, it seemed lavish and luxurious, but what originally should’ve been a splendid mansion was now shrouded in a thick shadow. The outside of it was covered in a sticky, black bug liquid that emitted an overwhelming stench.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to cross through this gathering place. This way we can walk a lot less.” Zhang Qian added. After saying this, his eyes immediately started watching the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects that flew out of this structure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects were quite savage. The guards’ soul pets would clearly have a greater difficulty dealing with them. After discussing, they agreed to let Ye Qingzi’s Ice Fire Demon Fairy deal with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Theoretically, eighth phase warrior rank and seventh phase commander rank should be around the same strength, but Ye Qingzi’s Ice Fire Demon Fairy’s strengthening process was even greater than Chu Mu’s Ice Air Fairy. With everyone else’s soul pets as support, it would be more than enough to deal with these strengthened eighth phase soul pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice Sword Formation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fairy incantation started, and massive ice swords began floating up beside the Ice Fire Demon Fairy. These ice swords were only about five meters in length, not as huge as the Ice Air Fairy’s, but their attacking strength was clearly stronger than the Ice Air Fairy’s!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the black crystal ice swords slowly appeared, they flew accurately towards the eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect, and cold air immediately pervaded the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This many ice swords probably won’t be able to kill those fellows.” Zhang Qian looked at Ye Qingzi’s Ice Fire Demon Fairy and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s defense was pretty strong. A few black crystal ice swords couldn’t really cause true harm to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Overlay!” Ye Qingzi didn’t mind him, still focused on controlling her own Ice Fire Demon Fairy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation almost instantly finished, and the Ice Fire Demon Fairy immediately cast an overlaying technique. The Ice Fire Demon Fairy’s ice sword formation was originally already thirty swords. With an overlay, it would become sixty!</span></p>
 <p><span style>These sixty ice swords floated in the air, emitting cold air and an imposing aura. Zhang Qian beside her originally wanted the Ice Fire Demon Fairy to cast an even more powerful technique. Seeing this, he decisively shut up, looking warily at the aggressive beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sixty black crystal ice swords was majestic and intimidating. After the first few ice swords flew out, all the rest flew over and, under the Microcontrol of the Ice Fire Demon Fairy, precisely stabbed the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insects that constantly moved in the air!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng beng beng!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice swords flew past, bringing cold air with them. No matter how good the flying abilities of the four eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect were, they still couldn’t dodge these Micro-controlled ice swords!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice swords that flew into the Heavenly Devil Insect constantly shattered into ice shards that showered down onto the ground. One of the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect took ten ice swords continuously, and it was sent heavily back into a window of the gathering place…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretty good control.” Meng Huazhong saw that Ye Qingzi’s Ice Fire Demon Fairy used basically one technique to get rid of the four eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect, and he showed some approval.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This house possibly has many Heavenly Devil Insect as well- everyone be careful.” Zhang Qian opened his mouth to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Zhang Qian looked at Feng Qi and said, “You lead the way and crash the doors open.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Qi nodded, and he immediately summoned his sixth phase seventh stage Violent Blood Pool Beast!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violent Blood Pool Beast: Beast world - Beast type - Pool Beast species - Violent Blood Pool Beast subspecies - commander rank</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Violent Blood Pool Beast had a body full of power similar to a bear and ape. It was definitely an extreme strength type of Beast Types!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Houhou!!!!” The Violent Blood Pool Beast let out a roar, as its iron-like arms slammed the ground and actually ripped the ground apart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long crack stemmed from where the Beast Blood Pool Beast slammed, and it quickly reached the doors of the gathering place, shattering open the door coated with black bug liquid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the door was shattered, a vomit inducing smell came with a wave of black insect air that reached everyone, immediately causing some cries of alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s bug poison. Everyone be careful.” Ye Qingzi lightly creased her brows, and used her remembrance to remind the guards with soul pets ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plant type soul pets had a strong immunity towards poison. Some special wood type soul pets could even absorb poison air and transform it into their own life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards were clearly all trained. Realizing it was bug poison, they immediately moved their beast type soul pets back, letting the plant type soul pets create all sorts of poison absorbing plant obstacles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A total of thirteen plant world soul pets caused countless roots to extend from underground and grow into a patch of root forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vine wood criss-crossed in the air, and much of it spread to the nearby streetways, lamps, windows, and walls to create a sturdy viney grid…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black insect air came like a storm cloud, but it was immediately blocked off by the plant defense. This plant defense was airtight, not letting a single bit of poison air through, and it even quickly absorbed it all, as it was converted into their life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wengwengwengweng!!!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, behind the plant defense came a thunderous roaring. Everyone could clearly hear the violent flapping of meat wings. Waves of stifling aura came through the plant wall, and they buffeted everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone stay on guard and summon your defensive soul pets!” Zhang Qian’s face immediately changed, as his eyes looked over to above the plant wall!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The plant wall was about twenty meters tall. When looking up, what made even Chu Mu startled was that there were near a hundred Heavenly Devil Insects that flew out from behind the plant wall, densely packed above the gathering area, looking viciously with their red eyes at everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“This is one of the places with the most Heavenly Devil Insects. Leave these Heavenly Devil Insects to my subordinates. Us four should charge in and get rid of the lair master. Then, these Heavenly Devil Insects will become scattered sand<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.” Zhang Qian immediately told the other three.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your subordinates can handle this?” Meng Huazhong looked at the hundred Heavenly Devil Insects and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem. They’ve all undergone strict training, and they have good cooperation between them. Even if there’s double the current amount, they can handle it.” Zhang Qian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, everyone follow me, my Rock Meteor Fairy has already dug an underground tunnel. We can go through by this tunnel.” Feng Qi said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu immediately lowered his head and indeed found that, since sometime ago, there had appeared a narrow tunnel. Even Chu Mu didn’t notice when this tunnel had been dug open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Feng Qi in front and Meng Huazhong following, Zhang QIan and Ye Qingzi in the middle and Chu Mu at the end, the five immediately jumped into the tunnel and passed through the tall plant wall into the gathering place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weng!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as everyone jumped into the tunnel, a Heavenly Devil Insect that the guards left alone suddenly retracted its wings and dived straight into the tunnel!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Mu, behind!” Heng Huazhong, as a spirit master, immediately noticed a decently strong Heavenly Devil Insect follow them in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu naturally noticed too, but he didn’t pay it any attention because following behind him was the Pitiful Appearance Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwu~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still holding the compressed blood bottle in its tail, little Mo Xie lazily licked her little claws and looked arrogantly at the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect that dived in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect didn’t seem to put little Mo Xie in its eyes at all. Using its four arms, it quickly crawled through the tunnel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Flame Claw!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect neared, Mo Xie’s claws swiped past indifferently. Immediately, the streak of the Royal Flame Claw lit up, and it abruptly clawed through the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s claws were already at the seventh rank late stage. With the effects of the sixth level full form offensive soul equipment, even without a technique, it neared eighth rank in power. With the royal flame claw, even a Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect would have a hard time blocking it, let alone an eighth phase unstrengthened Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The claw easily ripped the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect in two, and the powerful royal flame immediately spread from the open wound to the rest of the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect, burning its innards and blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhu~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the burning of the royal flames, in a matter of seconds, the Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect became ashes in the tunnel and the royal flames slowly dissipated…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s your Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox?” Meng Huazhong turned around to look at the instantly killed eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect and asked with amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En.” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a very powerful soul pet.” Meng Huazhong said with envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Meng Huazhong was a spirit master, he didn’t have a monarch rank soul pet. He had always been controlling high phase commander ranks. To have a perfect commander that could compete against monarch ranks was naturally every soul pet trainer’s dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie, don’t use blood flames……” As they continued, Chu Mu specially reminded Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwu~~~~~~~” Mo Xie let out a little nasal noise, acting cute, and expressing that she forgot that she needed to collect Heavenly Devil Insect blood for Chu Mu again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighth phase Four Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s blood was equal to five servings of blood. After Mo Xie habitually burned the corpse, they had lost quite a bit of blood and material.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The tunnel can only go up to here, we still have to walk on the surface. These Heavenly Devil Insects have powerful detecting abilities. If we get discovered, we will have a hard time reaching our full power underground.” Feng Qi said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En.” Everyone nodded. This was common knowledge that everyone understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Above us should be the main hall of the gathering area. There are quite a few eggs in there, and therefore quite a few female Heavenly Devil Insects will be in there. After everyone enters, if you have a fire type soul pet then summon it. We will use fire to escape being surrounded and enter the center area behind the gathering area. The lair master should be in the biggest hall of the gathering place.” Zhang Qian said.</span></p>
