When Liu Binglan mentioned that the Holy Realms still had a lot of room for development, Chu Mu specifically selected the Binding Wind Holy Region to train.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Binding Wind Spirit had already reached the dominator rank, and its strength was extremely powerful right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Binding Wind Spirit’s tribe had been destroyed at the hands of the Fierce Wind Demons. It wouldn’t forget this grievance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon entering the Binding Wind Holy Region, The Binding Wind Spirit guided Chu Mu through the wind paths towards the place where the Binding Wind Spirit’s tribe once laid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tribe of the past was now just an empty piece of land. It had experienced numerous things and followed Chu Mu to become stronger; however, it would never forget the loss of its tribe. No matter how strong it was, it could not obtain them back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present strong wind belt was of no threat to Chu Mu. When Chu Mu entered the Binding Wind Holy Region, he was curious as to what sort of a heaven and earth laid outside the enormous wind belts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this curiosity in mind, Chu Mu brought the Binding Wind Spirit to the Fierce Wind Demon’s Empire which occupied the entire Binding Wind Holy Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, in remembrance of it leaving its homeland and its species members that were killed in battle, as it passed through the Fierce Wind Demon Empire, Qin had conjured an angry wind!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After passing through the strong wind belt, an even stronger wind belt gradually appeared. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had been here before, and she had told Chu Mu that there was a fengshui mountain here. Without the strength of a dominator rank, one didn’t have the qualifications to enter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After over half a year of crazy training, Chu Mu had raised Qin to the low class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, low class dominator rank was far from enough for the current Chu Mu. Therefore, Chu Mu would be the first to explore the wind treasure placed in Binding Wind Holy Region that no person had ever stepped in before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yu’s training ground was Sacred Holy Region. His main goal for going there was to search for Limbo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sacred Holy Region was the holy land for flower type soul pets. Since creatures of the Evil Good Primogenitor would appear here, perhaps one of the five undying creatures, Limbo, would also appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Bai Yu also knew that even if his strength allowed him to find Limbo, he couldn’t make it revive his daughter. Therefore, Bai Yu’s main reason for entering Sacred Holy Region was to train.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao and Ye Wansheng entered two different Holy Regions to bitterly train. New Moon Land was now open to a certain extent to outsiders and even if they sat in Wanxiang City, there would ultimately still be many experts who rushed here. At the end of the day, strength was the most absolute thing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi and Mu Qingyi didn’t stay in Wanxiang City either. Mu Qingyi wanted to go train by herself, but Lu Yuqin genuinely wanted to take her as her disciple. After thinking it over, Mu Qingyi felt that she had to join Divine Sect, since this would be beneficial towards her strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Ye Qingzi, she possessed soul healing abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering Cloud Realm, she had discovered that even outside New Moon Land, the soul teachers and xuan teachers were at a loss when it came to souls. This included soul force recovery medicines, soul force increase medicines, and soul healing…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, Ye Qingzi had believed the soul method her teacher, Ying Rong, left her had come from outside of New Moon Land. Therefore, it would be more advanced than Cloud realm’s soul methods. She didn’t expect that even outside the realm, the soul method she controlled was unprecedented for normal soul teachers and xuan teachers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lu Yuqin learned that Ye Qingzi had the ability to heal souls, she sincerely invited her to come with her in hopes that Ye Qingzi would be able to make a trip to Divine Sect’s main altar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, the old sect master whose soul was very heavily wounded was very high ranked. The xuan method Ye Qingzi had chosen was not guaranteed to be able to heal him. Nonetheless, the problem was that even the various miraculous pills and medicines Divine Sect were using right now were unable to even lift the soul curse on the old sect master or heal his soul. Thus, Lu Yuqin invited Ye Qingzi to Divine Sect just to give it a try.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhengming Continent’s Divine Sect main altar is located in the Mu Family Dynasty’s southern mountains. It’s actually very close to Great Border City. When I was young and when cultivation got boring, I would secretly run off to Great Border City to bully a few people who were the same age as me. Martial Sister Mu comes from the Mu Family, so I presume that we must take a trip to Mu City, right?” said Xu Daofeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Xu Daofeng, Lu Yuqin, Ye Qingzi, Mu Qingy,i and Yu Suo were on the path towards Zhengming Continent’s Mu Family Great Border City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had been flying for two to three months now. The entire journey had been on Lu Yuqin’s soul pet. With its speed, travelling from Cloud City to Wanxiang City didn’t take more than a month. However, their current trip had been over territories that were countless times more vast than Cloud Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Ye Qingzi and Mu Qingyi had travelled to such a distant place. This world was indeed much larger than they imagined!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am, but a member of a very small branch. I have no connections with the true Mu Family.” said Mu Qingyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, Junior Martial Sister Mu is being modest. You come from Mu Tuan. Mu Tuan is very famous in Great Border City. Also…” at this point, Xu Daofeng through a glance at Lu Yuqin and lowered his voice, “also, Mu Penghe is very famous. If it wasn’t for him being too wanton and unrestrained, causing many people to target him, he would be a person well spoken of in the Mu Family Dynasty…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Penghe was King Mu. Mu Qingyi had never seen this grandfather of hers before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Mu Qingyi had heard of his stories when growing up. This extremely legendary figure that was full of character had always remained in Mu Qingyi’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now hearing many things about him again, Mu Qingyi really wanted to see her grandfather.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew for certain now that King Mu, Mu Penghe, was a prodigal person. He was very strong, and he did very self-indulgent things. He absolutely loathed authority and prioritized himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, Junior Martial Sister Mu, who is the golden masked woman who’s been sitting next to Ye Qingzi the whole time. Why has she not said a thing after following us for so long?” Xu Daofeng’s heart was itchy and he ultimately asked this question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Daofeng had asked this question before, but Ye Qingzi and Mu Qingyi hadn’t answered him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Ye Qingzi and Mu Qingyi should have gone to Divine Sect’s Zhengming main altar. In fact, Mu Qingyi was also curious as to why Chu Mu had let this Evil Good Queen run amok, and even follow Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi had also asked Ye Qingzi, who responded that Yu Suo had been restricted and could not release attacking techniques. The main reason for bringing her was in hopes of saving an even stronger soul pet trainer’s soul. She really was inseparable from Yu Suo’s good type techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu wanted to kill Yu Suo, but Ye Qingzi didn’t let him. Chu Mu didn’t have any other plans for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu also didn’t enjoy using devil flames to torture this woman now. Chu Mu had known about Ye Qingzi secretly helping this woman neutralize the pain from the high devil flame temperature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having locked Yu Suo up for these years now had pretty much eliminated the pent up grievance Chu Mu had. As long as this woman wasn’t scheming against him, Chu Mu couldn’t be bothered with her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had seen a few fragments of Yu Suo’s memory, and he could pretty much guess what Yu Suo wanted to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to complete the “major event” in her heart, Yu Suo had ultimately chosen to compromise with Chu Mu, and shared her Heart Core with Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Heart’s Core was the most important thing to the Evil Good Flower, and it was equivalent to a human heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu then had Yu Suo use her soul to swear that she would not harm Chu Mu or any of his people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a soul pact existing between Chu Mu and Yu Suo already, so if Yu Suo used her soul to swear, she would have to agree to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, even if she tried to break the vow, as long as the evil intentions in her mind grew strong, Chu Mu would be able to sense it through the shared Heart Core. If that happened, Chu Mu would only have to throw a ball of devil flames on the Heart Core. It wouldn’t matter where Yu Suo was. She would be instantly burned to a crisp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, after sharing the Heart Core, Yu Suo’s life was truly in Chu Mu’s hands. In the future, defecting again would be useless….&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that Yu Suo had always wanted to flee and emancipate herself to step on him. Therefore, she absolutely had to hand over the Heart Core.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, he never expected that after the independence fight, this Evil Good Queen had finally lowered her proud head to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Yu Suo didn’t pose any threat to him, and he would always know of her intentions to defect when they became intense, this couldn’t change Chu Mu’s extremely loathsome attitude towards this woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Chu Mu had just given Yu Suo to Ye Qingzi to be her medicinal helper, and also to protect Ye Qingzi. As for her ambition to conquer the world that still filled her mind, that could just follow her. The world was so unimaginably big that even Chu Mu was curious how much this woman would be able to conquer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Daofeng was a young and healthy man. He had been continuously inquiring about Yu Suo because even if she didn’t say anything, the noble and holy aura she emanated would make one’s heart itch regardless of her appearance. Thus, he wanted to go talk to her. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi could see what Xu Daofeng was thinking and warmly warned him: “I suggest you don’t try and attract her attention. She is Chu Mu’s slave, but when this slave eats people, she won’t even spit out their bones!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi’s words immediately caused Xu Daofeng to glance with shock at the golden masked and seemingly gentle Yu Suo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pure and beautiful looking girl was truly this terrifying?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Martial Sister Mu, are you joking with me?” Xu Daofeng dryly laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Lu Yuqin glanced back at the two of them having obviously heard their conversation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She glanced at Yu Suo before looking at Xu Daofeng. In a mental voice she calmly said to Xu daofeng: “Qingyi isn’t joking. It’s best if you don’t approach her. Remember this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Daofeng was stunned. He didn’t expect even his teacher to say this!&nbsp;</span></p>
