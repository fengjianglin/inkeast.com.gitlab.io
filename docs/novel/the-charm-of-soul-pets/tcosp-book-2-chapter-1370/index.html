 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu returned back to the spectator seats. He did not return towards the main Hovering Mountain, but he rather went towards the place where the people from the New Moon Land were seated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng had obediently shifted from his spot to allow Chu Mu to sit next to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, I have noticed that you’re actually a really shameless person. You usually tend to keep quiet and cannot be bothered to deal with trivial conflicts. However, once you encounter such a large event where you can show off your strength, you make sure that you are more flashy than anyone else present. Look at the gazes of all those maidens and the ladies looking at you. Compared to those brats, you are a true man amongst men,” nagged Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think so as well. However, after this battle, a lot of people will probably have heard about our New Moon Land. It's just perfect, we were just lacking a chance like this to astonish the world,” said Chao Lengchuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they had expected, while the two of them were talking, various major Boundary Lords from the surrounding seats had started approaching them with the intention of getting acquainted. Most of the discussions they engaged in were centered around the New Moon Land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had successfully managed to vent the anger that had accumulated in his heart to some extent. He did have some concerns regarding what he had done earlier, but his personality was affected by his Black Nightmare side, and so he ended up being a bit too cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They might have ended up offending some of the other factions, but that little bit of problem was nothing compared to the respect and awe that they were receiving now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Hidden Dragon, come here,” called Ye Qingzi as she waved towards the Little Hidden Dragon resting on Chu Mu’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon obediently flew to Ye Qingzi. The Little Hidden Dragon had received the greatest amount of damage in the previous battle. It would be faster for Ye Qingzi to treat it than for it to slowly recover by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye had just completed going through its Broken Limb Rebirth, so only its stamina was exhausted and it did not sustain much damage. As for Dead Dream, let alone inflicting any damage to it, none of the other soul pets even managed to touch it in the chaotic brawl. Naturally, it did not need any form of treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi held up the chubby body of the Little Hidden Dragon in her arms. She did not perform any techniques and only applied some ointment on the wounds of the Little Hidden Dragon to remove some of the potential deterioration poison. She then applied a layer of wound treatment ointment on top of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Open your mouth,” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon obediently opened its mouth, revealing its two rows of sparkling white dragon teeth. It did not make the Little Dragon look hideous at all, it only made it seem silly and cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi made the Little Hidden Dragon drink a soul healing potion. The potion tasted a bit bitter and was pungent. The Little Hidden Dragon wanted to puke it out, but Ye Qingzi glared at it and said, “Don’t puke it out, swallow it now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zazaza~!” the Litten Hidden Dragon whizzed out in grief and thought to itself in its heart, “she’s angry at Master, so why is she taking it out on me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the Little Hidden Dragon’s cute grudging behavior and Ye Qingzi’s stern expression, Chu Mu started smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s so funny? You think that you can do as you like just because you’re in a foul mood? That’s so childish,” snorted Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that Ye Qingzi was a little appeased. Hence, he grabbed her hand and did not say anything while just gazing right at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi started blushing and tried to pull her hand back. There were so many people around them and yet Chu Mu was doing such a thing so boldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, who told you that I’m not angry anymore?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not allow Ye Qingzi to pull her hand back. He held onto her hand tightly and did not care if anyone else noticed what he was doing . Then, he just gazed at Ye Qingzi quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was no match in terms of physical strength compared to Chu Mu who could semi-devilify. As she could not &nbsp;free herself no matter how much she struggled, she could only let him grab her hand and scold him in her heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">you’re always acting like this. You look like a decent man when you keep a stern expression. And yet nobody can do anything about you when you turn shameless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Ye Qingzi recall their time in Tianxia City’s Soul Pet Palace Beast Fighting Arena. At that also he just ran over to her and hugged her dumbly just like that. He looked like a completely different person from the merciless and savage appearance he displayed on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, Ye Qingzi had actually realised that the two extreme appearances of Chu Mu were both the real Chu Mu. He was swift, decisive, calm and merciless towards his enemies. However, he was also completely blank when it came to his own feelings and women, he was a little dull and slow. He only knew how to do the first thing that came to his mind, completely ignoring how others thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This guy definitely doesn’t understand &nbsp;a girl's thoughts, yet he’s somehow able to capture the hearts of so many girls. So annoying,” Ye Qingzi took a glance at Chu Mu and had silently complained in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chu Mu was a playboy, he would naturally have a lot of female acquaintances. It was also fairly normal as his current strength and his charm would easily allow him to capture the hearts of many girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was not like that. He strictly restrained his own feelings and took a stern attitude towards other girls. However, there were still some girls who would love him regardless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was not stupid. There was no way she could not realise the feelings of those girls. There was no point trying to hide them. The deeper they hid their feelings, the deeper they fell instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu appeared completely uninterested in spectating the following matches. He only wanted to mend his relationship with Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining three matches ended one after another. Lu Fenxue had unfortunately encountered Han Erxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle between the two of them was rather mediocre, but Han Erxing still won in the end. Lu Fenxue naturally could not aim for the champion position now after losing two consecutive times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The final champion would now be decided between Chu Mu, Han Erxing, Xin Xin and Tang Zhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo, Han Erxing and Tang Ang had sprung a trap on Chu Mu. However, not only did they fail to make the New Moon Land become an enemy of the public, there were many factions who were willing to get acquainted with the New Moon Land instead. This caused even Liu Binglan to be caught a little unprepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially during the territory meeting, the attitude they had towards the New Moon Land’s Female Supreme Liu Binglan had taken a complete turn. This change had caused even Liu Binglan to find it funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that even in the upper echelons, the people still bullied the weak while fearing the strong. Chu Mu’s ruthless behavior had completely deterred the factions that were intending to jeopardize the New Moon Land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, as Chu Mu had advanced to the final four, the benefits that the New Moon Land in the Northern Territory would be receiving were particularly huge. Those other major factions which were unable to obtain this benefit were trying their very best to show their support to the New Moon Land in order to gain a share of the benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, a newborn faction would always be facing suppression from the already existing factions. Liu Binglan had felt clear hostility from some of the people who were present during the meeting. This hostility was partially from the dissatisfaction they felt because the New Moon Land had suddenly risen up. Another portion was due to Chu Mu killing the soul pets of their younger generations. The relationship between them had worsened because of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had understood that the New Moon Land would be reaching this stage sooner or later if they had wanted to develop further. There was no reason for them to back off due to those existing factions. They should be forceful when it was necessary. If they were enemies, then they would not be showing mercy just because she compromised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our New Moon Palace can set up a branch in the Zhengming Main City?” exclaimed Pang Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Liu Binglan nodded, “The Territory Institution has agreed to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s great! When Shen Mo and I went back to the inn last night, we heard that many people had come wanting to enter our New Moon Land. Also, many people have now started betting on Chu Mu as they think that he may become the final champion in the end. If Chu Mu really becomes the champion, then there will probably be even more people who are willing to go to our New Moon Land. If we can even build a branch of our palace in the Zhengming Main City, then the recruitment will become much easier. After all, we shouldn't expect them to go all the way to the New Moon Land,” said Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I feel that if those people were to find out the uniqueness of our New Moon Land’s isolated space, then they will be going there no matter how far away it is,” said Chao Lengchuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm, that’s true. Actually, a large number of people don’t know of the existence of the Holy Region that is there in our New Moon Land,” Shen Mo nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh yeah, where did Chu Mu go?” Liu Binglan looked around but did not find Chu Mu anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Couple quarrel. Their relationship was always harmonious, so it’s rare to see them in a cold war. Now that they are finally having one, it’s really interesting to see,” said Pang Yue thoughtlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s gazes turned towards Pang Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao took a side glance at Pang Yue and asked, “Pang Yue, what are your intentions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pang Yue just realized that her choice of wording was wrong. She blushed and panickedly justified herself saying, “I only find it interesting, don’t misunderstand!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan had wanted to console Ye Qingzi, but due to the various issues that were coming up recently, she did not have the time to do so. In any case, it was rather unsuitable for her to be meddling in matters between the youngsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan could actually predict how this matter would turn out. She was just worried about whether the dull Chu Mu could find the right direction to reconcile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“By the way, what happened between the two of them? Why the cold war?” Chao Lengchuan became interested and joined the gossiping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone looked at Chao Lengchuan with disdain. The fact that he asked this proved that Chao Lengchuan had an even worse EQ than Chu Mu, terrifyingly low!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still need to ask something like that? It’s obviously because of the matter related to the little princess,” Ye Wansheng was the first to point it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, even an idiot can tell that the little princess is in love with Chu Mu. And Chu Mu also knew little princess from earlier......” said Pang Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aha, let’s make a bet. I bet that the little princess will win, who do you bet on?” Ye Wansheng suddenly laughed out loud and slammed a Mysterious Crystal that he had just obtained on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others became speechless. Pang Yue glared at Ye Wansheng and scolded, “Qingzi is your little sister, you’re being too heartless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng reasoned, “So what if she’s my little sister? You can’t involve personal feelings in such matters. I’m only analyzing it objectively!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others had only gotten acquainted with Chu Mu after Tianxia City. Ye Wansheng more or less knew a lot about the past matters between Chu Mu and the little princess in Tianxia City, including the Tianxia City event. He felt that Chu Mu was not really so heartless, especially when under the severe mental shock of witnessing the little princess dying before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I bet on Qingzi,” Pang Yue looked down on Ye Wansheng coldly and declared her opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also bet on Qingzi,” said Shen Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone started voicing out their opinions one by one. Ye Qingzi had naturally obtained more bets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it was Ning Maner’s turn, everyone looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it, she should bet on herself,” Ye Wansheng spoke for her after seeing that she had not spoken anything for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner immediately started blushing. She wanted to justify herself, but could not find the right words to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng is so annoying, will he die if he doesn’t speak a word?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan drank her tea and thought that she should remain silent in regards to this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Liu Binglan also had an opinion of her own. She felt that both the girls were decent. In the end, it still depended on whether Chu Mu could grasp it well. The current situation could easily cause one of them to slip through his fingers.</span></p>
