 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ai, I’ll admit it. On this day, Chu Mu is more handsome than me.” Ye Wansheng pouted his lips and sourly watched countless people crowd around Chu Mu. There were also people pervertedly reaching out their hands to grab his younger sister.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But speaking truthfully, Ye Wansheng was feeling rather gratified being able to see these two people walk to this point today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He remembered way back when he asked Chu Mu: “Are you really not interested in my younger sister?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head very confidently, yes!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng understood his younger sister very well, but even he didn’t expect that after being held captive at the Great Chu Family, he happened to give Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi an opportunity to be alone, and for some kind of emotions to breed between them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng was glad. He was glad that Ye Qingzi had met a reliable man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Qingzi is so blessed! I also want a wedding!” Shen Yue grabbed onto Ye Wansheng’s arm and looked like she was smitten.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Yue was Nightmare Palace’s Princess. If she got married, it would certainly be very grand. What female wouldn’t feel envious when they saw the solemn and dignified silver holy guards, the purple romantic bouquets, and the beautiful Immortal Ming Birds soaring through the air and the starry path leading to the moon lookout…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Wansheng, did you hear what I said?!” angrily said Shen Yue. This bastard was acting like he didn’t hear her!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m feeling hurt because my younger sister was swindled away by someone else.” Ye Wansheng pretended to look reluctant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He, in fact, was really feeling reluctant. This was a girl who had followed him around for so many years. He had watched her grow up from a young girl to a mature beauty. As a brother watching his younger sister marrying someone else, he obviously felt a bit reluctant. But most importantly, this could be used to shift the topic!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Shen Yue didn’t notice his intentions and really thought he was feeling hurt. She began to console him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The adjacent Chao Lengchuan looked very suspiciously at Ye Wansheng. He really didn’t believe his words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lengchuan, I also want a wedding!” said Xi Zhixian like a pampered girl. This tone was the same spoiled tone Shen Yue had used.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xi Zhixian was mature and easy going. Thus, when she used a coquettish and pampered tone, men didn’t want to sit there and do nothing about it. Chao Lengchuan almost instantly nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You responded so fast. It definitely wasn’t sincere.” harrumphed Xia Zhixian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan forced a smile. Ye Wansheng putting off the question led to him being criticized. And when he responded quickly, it also led to him being criticized. What was he supposed to do?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Again, it was Chu Mu who was blessed. He had managed to perfectly pick up a beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m being serious,” said Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Every man says the same thing. I don’t believe you.” said Xia Zhixian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then what do I have to do to make you believe me?” Chao Lengchuan was a bit anxious. He really wanted to marry Xia Zhixian as the Crown Prince’s Imperial Concubine now so as to prevent something unpredictable from happening in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan’s mind was very naive. He was still afraid that Xia Zhixian would leave him. He had to make it so that it was too late for her to change her mind, and she would eventually be dead set on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, I believe you. Let’s talk about this later. I still need to test you a little.” Xia Zhixian threw Chao Lengchuan a charming gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan forced a smile. Why was his situation the exact opposite of Ye Wansheng’s?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine. I’m someone who can take the test.” Chao Lengchuan didn’t try and rush things. Why not take it slow? At the very least, Chao Lengchuan could feel that Xia Zhixian, this mature woman, was slowly falling into his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think that a woman like Master will eventually be married one day?” asked Xia Zhixian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan knew that Xia Zhixian was talking about Yu Suo. He didn’t understand why she was still particularly loyal to Yu Suo. Initially, Chao Lengchuan had used some mental control on her. But he later discovered that Xia Zhixian’s devotion to her was from within the heart. As for why, Xia Zhixian would never say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There probably isn’t a person in this world willing to marry her, eh? Also, does she even understand what feelings are?” said Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I agree with your first point, but I don’t agree with your second. Her good side manifested out of life. How would you guys know how many of New Moon Land’s people she has saved before? Did you really think those servants, who would go to hell or high water for her, do so because she possesses a flower’s charm? The charm is only temporary, and once the person awakens from the charm, they will loathe her. Only a kind act like giving someone a second chance at life will be remembered by people. In other words, only kind acts related to someone’s honor or life will make that person willing to pledge their life to her. Thus, on this point, I feel that even Xiao Maner is inferior to her.” earnestly said Xia ZHixian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. Right now, she’s considered one of our people. It’s impolite for me to say anything.” said Chao Lengchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She has sympathy, compassion, grief, and anger. What do you mean she doesn’t understand feelings? Rather, it’s just that we don't understand her feelings.” said Xia Zhixian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan didn’t want to argue with Xia Zhixian, nor was there a need to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, do you really want to know what she’s like when she likes someone?” Xia Zhixian didn’t care if Chao Lengchuan didn’t want to hear as she continued.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I actually want to know that.” when Chao Lengchuan thought of that arrogant queen exposing a restless and in-love expression, he really thought it would be an interesting scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chao Lengchuan thought again and asked: “Speaking of which, what if she one day falls for Chu Mu? What would that be like?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If she wants something, she’ll get it… oh, she’ll probably have it to herself. If that time comes, Ye Qingzi will be in trouble.” Xia Zhixian laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, let’s not talk about that.” Chao Lengchuan hastily changed the topic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today was Ye Qingzi and Chu Mu’s wedding. It wasn’t too polite to gossip about Chu Mu here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re walking to the moon lookout.” Xia Zhixian stopped her casual guesses and focused on the couple wearing a fiery red ceremonial robe and a holy blue wedding dress. Her eyes gradually began to change.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking advantage of when Chao Lengchuan didn’t notice, Xia Zhixian sneaked a peak at Chao Lengchuan’s face. She seemed to imagine something in her head as a sliver of embarrassment that was difficult to spot flashed across her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cheers roared once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was holding up a bouquet in the plaza and on the streets. As Chu Mu led Ye Qingzi to the marriage moon lookout, these people threw the purple-colored bouquets into the air! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kiss her!!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kiss her!!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When people threw their bouquets into the air, the groom had to kiss the bride. Moreover, the kiss had to last until the purple flowers landed on the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was a person to not bother about the trifles and abided with the common will. He boldly grabbed Ye Qingzi’s waist and pulled her into his embrace as he placed his lips on her pink and fragrant lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past three days, Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi had no less than a hundred passionate kisses in different locations and at different times of day. However, they had never kissed in Wanxiang City under the fiery gazes of innumerable people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi didn’t expect Chu Mu to move so quickly. Before she could even get embarrassed, her lips were monopolized by Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first, she felt slightly uncomfortable since there were countless gazes watching them. Ye Qingzi was a woman who wasn’t as shameless as a man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gradually, as Chu Mu got into it, Ye Qingzi was no longer as passive. The cheers in her ears kept growing louder, but eventually, only Chu Mu was left in her heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t care how many people were here to congratulate her. What she cared more about was that the person next to her when she stepped onto the moon lookout marriage altar was Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the emotions stirred, Ye Qingzi was no longer as passive and began to slightly react.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She grabbed Chu Mu’s neck and her soft breasts pushed into Chu Mu’s broad chest as she lightly stood on her tiptoes…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their lips touched and brushed as their tongues softly tangled with each other. Sometimes they would softly kiss with affection, while other times they couldn’t hold back their feelings and deeply kiss. This was a world that only belonged to the two of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A kiss between the king and the queen seemed to ignite the feelings between the couples in the plaza. Numerous people who brought their lovers began to deeply kiss their significant other. Today, Wanxiang City was pervaded with romance, and a heavy affection between man and woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the plaza, among all the different men and women, a snowy skin woman glared at the adjacent man, saying: “What are you throwing the bouquet so high for? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that they would kiss longer.” mischievously laughed the man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aren’t you scared of being stifled?” Lin Mengling turned her face as she felt somewhat unhappy inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people really were something. Kissing each other in front of everyone!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, right now people around her were kissing their partners, while she just foolishly stood there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of a world of couples, even Divine Sect’s heavenly pride, Lin Mengling, was at a loss. This was a world that ignored status and strength. It only cared about whether one had someone they liked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about we also…” Xia Yin mischievously raised his brows as he spoke to Lin Mengling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You dare?!” Lin Mengling’s eyes were filled with anger as she glared at Xia Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What don’t I dare not do?” Xia Yin withdrew his mischievous smile as he suddenly grabbed LIn Mengling’s thin waist and pulled her into his arms!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling was terrified by the sudden action and before she could react, she felt the fiery aura of a man. Then, her small lips were covered by someone else. She couldn’t curse even if she wanted to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Atmosphere was a weird thing. If the people around a person were cheering, the emotions of this person would be easily affected and he or she would join everyone in the cheers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And when everyone around was quietly and impassionately kissing their lovers, their intoxication and passion from the kiss, as well as their deep affection, would make every single person feel envious. And for those who had never felt the feeling of a kiss before, they would want to try…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling really had hoped that someone would kiss her at that moment because she wanted to have a taste of that feeling. Thus, she saw the only man next to her, Xia Yin, as a fantasy. But this was just a fantasy; she couldn’t actually make it a reality. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she completely did not expect that Xia Yin had actually dared kiss her even without her consent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was sour and rough. It wasn’t as sweet as she imagined. But for some reason, it seemed to touch her heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin knew that Lin Mengling didn’t have any experience. Thus, after the initial kiss, he slowly and softly guided her one step at a time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pai!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The long kiss finally ended with a loud slap.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard, I’m going to send you to Divine Sect’s Execution Tower using my status as Vice Magistrate!” Lin Mengling angrily pointed at Xia Yin after slapping him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yin indifferently laughed. He glanced at the bouquet he had thrown that still hadn’t landed on the ground and said: “Since I’m going to die, I may as well kiss you again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Xia Yin lowered his head and kissed her!&nbsp;</span></p>
