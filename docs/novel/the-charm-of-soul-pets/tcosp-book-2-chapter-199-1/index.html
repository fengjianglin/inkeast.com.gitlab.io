 <p><strong>Chapter 199: Mass Kill, Severe Towering Ice</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu was clearly straining to deal with them all. Qing Li and the others were similarly not hopeful. As for the teen experts of Elemental Sect, because they didn’t have the experience of group fighting, one of them already let one of their soul pets die against the Crafty Rock Guard group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A soul pet trainer had to be very cautious in battle, especially in such a chaotic group battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a soul pet was defeated, it was acceptable. After all, as long as one had soul power, one could trade a soul pet with more energy in to continue battle. Yet, if a soul pet died, not only was one’s soul hurt, but one was also missing a fighting soul pet, losing lots of his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the five people’s soul pets, the most powerful was Qing Li’s eighth phase third stage Purple Lightning Devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Purple Lightning Devil was at the eighth phase strengthened commander rank. Its defense was already not something that these Crafty Rock Guards could penetrate, but this Purple Lightning Devil was surrounded by over fifty seventh phase mid stage Crafty Rock Guards. If he didn’t get rid of them, he won’t be able to escape easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six hundred crafty rock guards, and the five people summoned a total of fifteen soul pets. It could be said that almost every soul pet had to face forty Crafty Rock Guards. Only the likes of &nbsp;Qing Li’s Purple Lightning Devil, King Kong Raging Flame, Ice Winged Tiger, and Zhang Qin’s Raging Flame Demon, Rare Blood Beast, and Mysterious Crystal Ice Crystal Fairy could possibly withstand this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other three were all young generation members. Their strongest soul pets were seventh phase high stage strengthened elemental commander ranks. Their soul pets combatting strength couldn’t be as powerful as Qing Li and Zhang Qin’s, so they were quickly heavily wounded in the mixed battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The changing of soul pets was getting more frequent, and the three young generation experts were looking more and more miserable. Qing Li and Zhang Qin were also unbearably selfish, only caring for themselves and not coming to help them relieve pressure…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A near ten meter wide huge rock made a huge shadow and suddenly fell from a high place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeng Linshan’s Ice Air Fairy was still chanting an incantation when its mysterious ice covered body was hit by this rock, sending it straight from the walkway to the bottom of the mountain, making contact with the steep mountain several times while rolling, before finally disappearing into the depths!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeng Linshan stared helplessly as his Ice Air Fairy fell the thousand meter distance, and his face turned pale as a sheet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Ice Air Fairy…...My Ice Air Fairy……” Zeng Linshan was only an Elemental Sect expert that was relatively famous within Colored Sky City. A high talent seventh phase middle stage Ice Air Fairy was the means with which he could exceed his peers. Just dying off the mountainside like that, Zeng Linshan’s heart was like it was pierced with daggers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The break of this soul pact immediately hurt Zeng Linshan’s soul. While Zeng Linshan had trouble fighting with three soul pets, now it was worse with two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unknowingly, Zeng Linshan had already been devoured by the surging tide. No matter how Zeng Linshan changed his soul pets, he couldn’t escape the fate of dying…...</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s status wasn’t too optimistic either. Chu Mu put all his soul power on casting soul techniques, and he didn’t plan on switching soul pets. After all, no matter if it was the Devil Tree Battle Soldier or the Night Thunder Dream Beast, neither could handle the current situation. As for the white nightmare, Chu Mu had to keep him, or else when danger truly came, Chu Mu himself would die too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ling~~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even with the protection of Chu Mu, there were still many massive wounds on the Ice Air Fairy’s body, causing the naïve Ning to become angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nongnongnong!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fifteen meter long rock cylinder scarily appeared in front of Ning’s face. Ning was just angrily chanting when he realized the danger, and immediately planned on giving up the incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue to chant.” Chu Mu sent the command to his Ice Air Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ling~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice Air Fairy let out a moment of hesitation, but it didn’t hesitate for long, continuing its incantation for the Ice Sword Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After casting the spell, twenty three Mysterious Crystal Ice Swords quickly gathered and hung diagonally on the mountain walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost at the same instant that the Ice Air Fairy finished the Ice Sword Formation, the rock spike came within ten meters of the Ice Air Fairy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t even take a second for the spike to cover ten meters. When the Ice Air Fairy felt a terrifying energy approach, its mental concentration immediately slipped, and ten swords fell down because of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet just as the rock spike was about to hit, Chu Mu swiftly appeared before the Ice Air Fairy with an already dissipating Wind Dragon Bind swirling around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he was bedrock, Chu Mu stood in front of his Ice Air Fairy, watching emotionlessly at the incoming ten rock spikes, revealing no emotions in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ten five meter long rock spikes was an unimaginable power for human-kind. When the rock spikes hit Chu Mu, they immediately exploded. The powerful impact sent Chu Mu back a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mysterious Ice Armor he just put on himself immediately shattered, and the retreated Chu Mu had also hurt his internal organs with this blast, having some blood leak out his mouth corners…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter what attack you’re facing, don’t panic.” Chu Mu wiped off the blood on his mouth and said to his Ice Air Fairy behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ling~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing its owner get hurt for it, the Ice Air Fairy let out a murmur, feeling sorry for the ten swords it accidentally let go of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue fighting.” Chu Mu didn’t say more, telling his Ice Air Fairy to send the last thirteen swords towards incoming Crafty Rock Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ling~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning’s emotions had a major ripple after Chu Mu’s actions. Its snow white pupils suddenly radiated a cold blue light, and the Mysterious Crystal Armor shed off of its body, revealing its exquisitely made body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ling~~~~~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning again let out a long call, and the blue and cold energy within its body slowly came out, lighting its body up in an ice blue color. Immediately, an even purer, colder, and severe ice type crystal came out from the Ice Air Fairy’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Towering Ice Crystal?” Chu Mu stared blankly, surprised at the ice blue glow that was forming on the Ice Air Fairy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Snow Fruit’s main effect was to let a soul pet grasp an energy crystal. Before, when the Ice Air Fairy hit seventh phase first stage, Chu Mu could feel the Ice Air Fairy’s body was brewing up the seeds of a Towering Ice Crystal. According to Chu Mu’s estimates, if it grew a few more stages, his Ice Air Fairy would be able to control Towering Ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Chu Mu didn't think was that his Ice Air Fairy would actually grasp it right now!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation started, and Ning directly gave up its control of the Ice Sword Formation and used two seconds of Elemental Willpower and finished the incantation for Cold Crushing Mark!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven ice magic hoops suddenly appeared and, without the seventh phase middle stage Crafty Rock Guards having any chance of reacting, the ice hoops fell upon them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue white Towering Ice covered them, completely freezing the bodies of these seventh Crafty Rock Guard bodies!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven ice magic hoops concentrated at one point and seven sounds appeared, rendering the seven Crafty Rock Guards into ice shards and rocks!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instakill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effects of the Towering Ice made the Cold Crushing Mark even stronger, instantly killing the seven seventh phase middle stage Crafty Rock Guards!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the shattered ice shards and rocks floating around in front of him, Chu Mu’s surprise slowly transformed into joy. Towering Ice- his Ice Air Fairy finally controlled Towering Ice!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ling~~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towering Ice Ice Sword Formation! Two second casting time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the entire process, the eight Crafty Rock Guards in front of it simultaneously casted rock type techniques, attacking the Ice Air Fairy frantically as it was chanting an incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elemental Willpower!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing the eight Crafty Rock Guard’s attacks, Ning was still chanting its fairy incantation, allowing all the attacks from the Crafty Rock Guards to land on its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Air Fairy’s ice skin already had Towering Ice Skin, reaching near eighth rank in defense. Such a defense wasn’t something a few seventh phase middle stage unstrengthened Crafty Rock Guards could break.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flying rocks only left thin cracks on the Ice Air Fairy, yet as the Ice Air Fairy was being attacked, it still finished the Towering Ice Ice Sword Formation incantation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue white massive swords floated in the air. As the cold air spread, it almost froze the nearby hundred meters of mountains!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its thin hand lightly waved, and the Ice Air Fairy controlled the twenty three Towering Ice Swords towards the eight seventh phase middle staged Crafty Rock Guards in front of it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Overlay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation finished in an instant. While the twenty three towering ice ice swords were still in midair, another twenty three appeared above the Ice Air Fairy, following the previous swords!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peng!!! Peng!!!!! Peng!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight Crafty Rock Guards formed a thick rock wall, but these rock walls couldn’t possibly stop the attack of the forty six ice swords. After they shattered, the eight Crafty Rock Guards were sent flying down the thousand meter peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finishing up the eight Crafty Rock guards, the Ice Air Fairy and Chu Mu’s pressure was greatly relieved. The rest of the Crafty Rock Guards couldn’t easily come near Ning, who could almost instantly kill them with ice type techniques!</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did that bastard Zeng Linshan say that the Ice Air Fairy was only sixth phase ninth stage and controlled only advanced Mysterious Crystal?!” Qing Li bit down hard and said fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Qing Li’s perspective, he could perfectly see Chu Mu and his Ice Air Fairy a hundred meters away, but he didn't see the Ice Air Fairy evolve into basic Towering Ice. He did, however, see the Ice Air Fairy kill a group of Crafty Rock Guards with one ice type technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seventh phase first stage and able to deal with forty seventh phase Crafty Rock Guards. From Qing Li’s perspective, it wasn’t an Ice Air Fairy, as its ice type talent was very close to some low quality monarch ranks!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeng Linshan, where did Zeng Linshan die to![1.TL: Idiom meaning “where did he **** go”, but is a pun made by author in this case]” Qing Li roared angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, Zeng Linshan already died……” The teen constantly hiding beside Qing Li and Zhang Qin said.</span></p>
