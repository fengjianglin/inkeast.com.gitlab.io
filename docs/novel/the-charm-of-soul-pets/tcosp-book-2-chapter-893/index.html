 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These Rose Flower Demons are covering the entire city. Even if you were stronger than you are, you can’t save the Fairy Butterflies spread over the entire city. Otherwise, you’ll expose yourself to her.” said the blind old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But…” Chu Mu didn’t want the defector young woman to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dead Dream, with its rank, would use the life inheritance when its life came to an end to continue its race. However, if it fell into a trap and was killed, it would not be able to use life inheritance in time. If there was only one Dead Dream in this world, then the Dead Dream race would become extinct!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s protecting this piece of land.” said the blind old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The city was looking more and more vibrant, full of nature’s energy. No matter where one went, it was always possible to see the beautiful picture of overflowing spring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one in this city knew that underneath this flourishing scene there was hidden a terrifying legion of thieves. These thieves had absorbed away all of the natural energy that had accumulated over several hundred years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these hundred years, the earth would become more and more fertile. However, in another hundred years, this energy filled land would become barren where not even grass would grow!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiang Rong City’s territory was the area that the Dead Dream protected. The reason why it appeared in this city and used the powerful Darkness Withering technique to wither all the plants was not to destroy the prosperity that was cultivated with great difficulty by the humans, nor was it to bring disease and disaster to the city; instead, it was to save this piece of land and save the Xiang Rong City for another 100 years!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how many people in Xiang Rong City knew of the truth? Even if someone told them everything, the only thing they would believe was that the holy goddess Empress Concubine and these puppet flower demons that would protect them. They wouldn’t believe that the Empress Concubine was going to steal the resources Xiang Rong City would rely on in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">… all over the city, the puppet demon flowers were rapidly growing, transforming into a huge forest where the sun could not be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful hypnotic pollen sprinkled through the air, covering the city. The puppet flower demons weren’t attacking the residents of this city. However, after the pollen was spread, everyone who wasn’t able to head underground in time was forced into a hypnotic sleep. Even soul pet trainers were unable to stop themselves from sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sleeping pollen flickered with a blue light. The light attributed pollen completely countered the dark attributed Fairy butterflies. Although the Black Fairy Butterflies also could create hypnotic sleeping powder, while flying in the sleepy air, unknowingly, a few of the smaller Fairy Butterflies began beating their wings slower before slowly falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The puppet flower demons were also a holy blue color, and they grew like huge trees aiming for the skies. In the view of others, they resembled a mighty army protecting the city. However, once the Fairy Butterflies fell en masse from the large-scale sleeping pollen and fell into the puppet flower demons, the puppet flower demons changed forms. Their greedy flower mouths and poisonous teeth were exposed and ripped the sleeping Fairy Butterflies into pieces… even though there was no blood, each street and alleyway was filled with this terrifying scene. The low ranking Black Fairy Butterflies were easily put into a sleep, and then died in their sleep under the heartless attacks from the puppet flower demons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pu pu pu pu pu~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ground of high ranked Fairy Demons’ wings were destroyed as they flitted past Chu Mu and the two others. Their injury riddled bodies flew through the tall yet imposing puppet flower demon’s branches. They attempted to use mental techniques to awaken the sleeping Black Fairy Butterflies hanging on the petals and branches.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the holy blue colored puppet flower demons were extreme counters to both the wing type and the dark type. This group of high ranking Black Fairy Butterflies was ultimately unable to escape its fate of death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They know this place is filled with traps. Yet, why do they still come?” Chu Mu looked at the beautiful yet sad snowflake-like bodies of the withered Black Fairy Butterflies. A sense of sorrow arose in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It promised Cheng Mo that when this piece of land was in danger, it would appear…” said the blind old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s like moths drawn to a flame…” Ye Qingzi could no longer watch the sad scene of the dying Black Fairy Butterflies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu glanced at Ye Qingzi, before looking at the cheering soul pet trainers on the streets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul pet trainers hadn’t been put into a hypnotic sleep. They viewed these Black Fairy Butterflies as rampant insects that brought the plague and death with them. The more of them that died, the more the soul pet trainers would feel safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These people really can’t tell. The Dead Dream truly is a moth drawn to a flame.” Chu Mu sighed with a bit of resentment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It truly was a moth drawn to a flame. When it was weak, it sought for its survival and when it was strong, it sought for the survival of weaker creatures … it was the king of this piece of land, yet it had never appeared on this piece of land with a mighty and imposing aura, demanding for resources from its own land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, when danger appeared, its lonely figure appeared in the air in elegance, coolness, and grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There didn’t need to be too much of an explanation. The only thing it was doing was fulfilling its duty. Even if the people of this land saw the color black as auspicious, or even if those ignorant people had been bewitched so terrifyingly by a female demon that they couldn’t tell the difference between right or wrong… Chu Mu believed that it couldn’t be bothered if the humans knew about its intentions, nor did it require humans to understand that it was protecting this land. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was even the chance that in a hundred years, the people would put the blame on it for the resources of the land withering up. But what did that matter. If the humans couldn’t realize that the one destroying the land they survived off of was the goddess they worshiped, and the one saving them was the Dead Dream in the darkness, then the fate of this nation had already been determined and would ultimately perish. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things that were beautiful, multi-colored, and enticing were always poisonous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entirety of Xiang Rong City was protecting a holy flower that on the exterior was flawless and extremely enticing. They hadn’t noticed the poison unknowingly seep into their bodies and blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if someone told them they had been poisoned, they would get angry and turn on that person because they were still in a fantasy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu never saw himself as a hero of the world. The only things he cared about were the things that already had emotions - people, cities, soul pets, territory… however, Xiang Rong City’s people were already beyond cure. Chu Mu could only watch from the side. What he did care about was the Dead Dream, like a moth drawn to a flame.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The layer of black covering the sky gradually grew thinner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The millions of Black Fairy Butterfly were being destroyed one at a time. The world of blackness was being occupied by the beautiful yet poisonous holy blue color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chi chi chi chi~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Black Fairy Butterfly filled with wounds fell onto Chu Mu’s shoulder. With exhaustion, it half opened its eyes. It lightly fluttered its wings. The light in its eyes had noticeably dimmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this was only one small Fairy Butterfly of the Dead Dream’s million, Chu Mu could see very much from its eyes. Presumably, the Dead Dream’s heart was also like its eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I buried Tianmang’s soul pets where Chen Mo was buried. Come with me and take a look. That item may be there.” said the blind old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hundred years ago, there was someone stronger than the Alliance Master. The thing it left probably wasn’t ordinary so he couldn’t let the defector young woman have it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How many more places do we have to search?” the Empress Concubine stood on a holy blue flower with an indifferent expression. Towards the surrounding Black Fairy Butterflies dropping from the sky, she was indifferent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s only one more place left. That place is a commemoration memorial. Senior Chen expressed that it was a historical tomb, and that the ground there was special. Our seeds and branches were unable to penetrate that place.” said the chief flower girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, it’s in that place.” the Empress Concubine nodded her head. She used soul remembrance to say to the Flower Emperor Master, “I’ll leave the rest to you. Don’t let off a single Black Fairy Butterfly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commemorative memorial was on a grassy slope located north of the library.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a rather simple commemorative memorial. There was no name or record. The only thing there was a solitary white stone, silently erected in its spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was one of the few places in the city that had no puppet flower demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you see anything?” behind the stone memorial, a young woman wearing a long skirt was half kneeling on the ground, She was peering into the hole dug into the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nie~~~~~~~~” from within the hole dug so deep underground it was like a well, a helpless voice rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How stupid. Second White, go down and look. My senses cannot be wrong. It’s definitely here.” the young girl pouted her small mouth. She was like a pampered and bullying young mistress, ordering her bodyguards while criticizing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second White’s face was unsightly. It was a mighty Nightmare Emperor. How could it do digging work!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after squirming for a moment, it was unable to withstand this mistress’ schemes. It could only “roll up its sleeves” and jump underground to dig with Fourth White.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dirt here was much more firm than other places in Xiang Rong City. The White Nightmares had to exert no small amount of effort here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have you seen it??”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner was lying next to the black well peering down as her hair freely dangled down.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two White Nightmares both looked up with bitter expressions, indicating that they hadn’t found anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Keep looking!” bossily said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pai!” suddenly, a soft hand slapped Ning Maner’s butt which was raised in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner retracted her body in a fright and in shame. She turned around angrily to see which fellow had the guts!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, Big Sister Ye…” Ning Maner immediately saw the beautiful Ye Qingzi standing next to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person who had just hit her was Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner hastily stood up and arranged her long skirt. With a flushed face, she stared at the stone-faced Chu Mu who was on the side. In a sweet voice she said: “How would I know someone would be here? Naughty big brother. Stop acting prudish.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Silly girl, have you found anything?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Chu Mu never expected Ning Maner would come here first. He remembered that she seemed to have told him before that she had sensed some spirit aura coming from here. It seemed that there really could be something buried underneath.&nbsp;</span></p>
