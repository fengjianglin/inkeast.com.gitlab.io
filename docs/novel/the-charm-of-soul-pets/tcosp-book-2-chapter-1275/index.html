 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t stay in Wanxiang City for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a number of xuan items on him that could be used to strengthen his soul pets, so he would obviously go do this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu went to the Southern Forbidden Region to use devil style of training on Zhan Ye, the Little Hidden Dragon, the Devil Tree, Ning, Qin and the Ghost King. They didn’t spend much time training, but Chu Mu spent all 24 hours of the day fighting non-stop, continuously switching out his soul pets and changing training locations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu received the welcome of Southern Forbidden Region’s lord again. The other kingdoms in Southern Forbidden Region were still growing in number; it didn’t matter how many wars the Southern Forbidden Region’s lord started, the resources were not enough to meet the demand. So Chu Mu coming here to sweep through the region would get rid of two or three seventh or eighth rank kingdoms. This was a good thing for Southern Forbidden Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Chu Mu came to Southern Forbidden Region, he informed Sang Ying that his solo training could take a year or so. Thus, Sang Ying could communicate with Yuan Sui during this period of time to perfect New Moon Navy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Chu Mu was solo training this time, Chao Legnchuan and Ye Wansheng had also entered Southern Forbidden Region. In order to focus on training, the three of them had gone separate ways. This would also ensure a maximization of fighting resources since what Southern Forbidden Region had the most was enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Southern Forbidden Region lacked resources, but was overflowing with soul pets. Chu Mu presently did not lack resources and was focused on raising the training percentage of his soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this one year, Chu Mu didn’t go anywhere else. He walked from one kingdom to the next, occasionally encountering experts from outside the realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these experts learned that Chu Mu was New Moon Land’s king, they were extremely friendly towards him. This demonstrated how New Moon Land’s status was continuously rising when even middle remembrance or high remembrance spirit dominators would intentionally try to make friends with Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After bitterly training for a year, Chu Mu raised the Ghost King’s rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost King’s rank was often the lowest. When Chu Mu realized that the enemies he would encounter in the future would be even stronger, higher defense would be imperative. For example, Prince Chao’s Thousand Wave Beast possessed the void armor and could fight one versus two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The success rate of a higher quality Ghost Stone was 100%. After training the Ghost King, Chu Mu managed to make it a high class dominator in half a year.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With rock as its main attribute, the Ghost King’s defense was higher than Chao Lengchuan’s Thousand Wave Beast. The Thousand Wave Beast would probably have to use its void armor in order to compare to the Ghost King’s defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, the Ghost King’s defense wasn’t just limited to this. If it used Monarch Ghost Transformation to enter a fully defensive state, its defensive power would multiply. Thus, if it fully erupted into defense form, it would have defensive power four times that of a normal high class dominator!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This defensive power was around that of a peak beast type dominator!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its only flaw was that in a fully defensive form, its offensive power would be lower; it would require a lot of effort to hack down even a high class dominator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After strengthening the Ghost King, Chu Mu also strengthened the Devil Tree Battle Soldier to the high class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had taken a seventh rank wood type crystal from the Holy Region Storehouse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Region Depot had seventh rank xuan items and even a few eighth rank xuan items. The number of xuan items Chu Mu brought back were more than that, so there was nothing wrong with just taking a seventh rank wood type crystal from the Holy Region Storehouse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The quality of the seventh rank wood type crystal wasn’t very high so Chu Mu raised his Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s training percentage to 100 before it was able to enter the high class dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After it entered the high class dominator rank, Chu Mu assimilated the eighth rank Wood Xuan Leaf into its soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wood Xuan Leaf wasn’t a strengthening spirit item, but a support spirit item.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of supportive spirit item could greatly increase the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s offensive power. Its normal attacks were now equivalent to a high class dominator rank beast type.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wood type creatures innately could use four or five techniques at once. If it now possessed a high class dominator rank beast type’s offensive might, the effect would equip it with offensive power near a peak dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The high quality Ghost Stone and the Wood Xuan Leaf had greatly increased Chu Mu’s power. In the future if he faced peak dominator ranks, it would probably be easy for him to defeat them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he hadn't found another Combining Amber, Chu Mu stopped training Zhan Ye after it reached 70% training percentage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li had told him that Wupan Continent definitely sold Combining Ambers. And even if they didn’t, Chu Mu could find a higher ranked xuan teacher to help combine xuan items.Therefore, Zhan Ye’s high class dominator rank wasn’t a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye had the highest explosive potential of all of his soul pets. If it reached the high class dominator rank, Zhan Ye would probably be able to near Mo Xie and Night once its strength had fully erupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Qin and Ning’s ranks, Chu Mu could only leave them for now and wait until he found suitable xuan items to strengthen them. Currently, their training percentages were about twenty or thirty percent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a single year, the amount Chu Mu could raise his soul pets’ training percentages was limited even if he quadrupled controlled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, Dead Dream’s rank gave Chu Mu a slight headache. Since its attribute was special, he had to find a phoenix species xuan item. However, phoenix species xuan items were rare, so he could only look to find them in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dead Dream’s species rank was relatively high and it was one of the rare creatures that could raise its own species ranks. Thus, Chu Mu felt that finding a dead thunder attribute xuan item wasn’t realistic and that increasing its strength was probably best done through some form of nirvana. Chu Mu had heard Mu Qingyi say that if a phoenix was able to fully undergo nirvana, its strength could rise by multiple levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had arranged with Chao Lengchuan and Ye Wansheng to only train a year before going to Wupan Continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the one year, Chu Mu went to that place in Southern Forbidden Region to greet the lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Southern Forbidden Region’s lord gifted Chu Mu with an eighth rank White Nightmare soul crystal as a reward for helping it expand its borders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This unexpected gift pleased Chu Mu. He was currently at the sixth remembrance spirit dominator rank and if White Nightmare was able to rise to the high class dominator rank, his half devil transformation would easily enter the peak dominator rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul pet trainers were often like this. If one of their soul pets entered a higher rank, there was a high chance this would spur the strength of their other soul pets. For example, the return of Night had greatly increased Chu Mu’s strength and his training speed was probably far superior to many large factions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from the eighth rank xuan item, the Southern Forbidden Region’s Lord had heard Chu Mu’s New Moon Land was in the process of expanding. Thus, it dispatched a group of dominator rank Nightmares to help defend the territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among this group of dominator ranks, the leader was a peak dominator rank White Nightmare. This made Chu Mu jump with fright as this Southern Forbidden Region Lord truly thought highly of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Nightmares had abnormal attributes and once they reached the peak dominator rank, they would be able to fight one versus two. Thus, with this White Nightmare defending New Moon Land, who would dare make a move on New Moon Land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that Chu Mu could guess Southern Forbidden Region Lord’s actual intentions. This old schemer had definitely set its sights on Nightmare Holy Region, and wanted to develop a faction of its influence there. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nightmare Holy Region was originally the territory of Nightmares. Thus, instead of giving Nightmare Holy Region to those wild nightmare rulers, why not instead give it to its own people? Southern Forbidden Region would be able to create its own territory in Nightmare Holy Region as well as create a development environment for Nightmare Palace. This was mutually beneficial. Moreover, Southern Forbidden Region Lord had said that Chu Mu could mobilize the White Nightmare General whenever he wished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was constantly running all over the place and New Moon Land really did need a formidable creature to help defend the territory. Cloud Gate’s old man wasn’t suitable as a watchman because normally unless Wanxiang City was threatened, he wouldn’t take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Nightmare General’s underlings were composed of a total of three high class dominators, ten middle class dominators, 50 low class dominators and pseudo dominators. This was a total 63 underlings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, First White was looking after Nightmare Holy Region. With this group of experts entering Nightmare Holy Region, First White would be like a fish back in the water. Indeed, Nightmare Holy Region was massive and perhaps even larger than Southern Forbidden Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving Southern Forbidden Region, Chu Mu returned to Xiangrong City where Chao Lengchuan and Ye Wansheng were waiting for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiangrong City was the city closest to Southern Forbidden Region. As Southern Forbidden Region, which was the most optimal training ground, was being used, Xiangrong City had become New Moon Land’s second capital. Added on its unique construction style, this city that was full of Fairy Butterflies and the fragrance of butterflies attracted more and more experts from outside the realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiangrong City had returned to Xia Zhixian’s hands and as experts from outside the realm entered the city, Xia Zhixian, as the city lord, became very very busy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Xia Zhixian had wholeheartedly decided to be with Chao Lengchuan. Furthermore, her willingness to help New Moon Land develop could be seen. Therefore, Chao Lengchuan was able to keep his mind at ease as he went to the wilderness to continue strengthening himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, Chao Lengchuan, Ye Wansheng, Mu Qingyi, Ye Qingzi, Bai Yu and Liu Binglan were the soul of New Moon Land. If a faction wanted to develop, it could not do so without powerful strength. Their current jobs were to keep strengthening themselves and not only become the soul of New Moon Land, but also accrue enough fame and prestige in other territories and borders. Otherwise, New Moon Land would forever remain insignificant in the eyes of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, don’t scare me like this. The White Nightmare thugs following behind you are going to with us to Wupan territory? Isn’t that too flashy?” Ye Wansheng looked with a bit of fear at the group of dominator rank White Nightmares behind Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu would be flashy when he needed to. He had intentionally paraded around over 60 White Nightmares to show off New Moon Land’s strength to those outside the realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No other king of a territory would have such an impressive formation of over 60 dominator rank White Nightmares behind him like Chu Mu did.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Southern Forbidden Region Lord sent them to help us defend New Moon Land as well as expand into Nightmare Holy Region.” explained Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I forgot that the Nightmares are part of the same family as you.” said Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhixian is busy with Xiangrong City matters. She won’t be able to leave for a while.” said Chao Lenchuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jinrou should also be looking after the Devil Souls.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then it’s just us three men leaving home to make our way in the world? In any case, we should bring a support soul pet trainer with us.” said Ye Wansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng couldn’t separate himself from women. Even if the woman didn’t belong to him, she would still be eye candy to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why doesn’t Pang Yue come with us? We'll be able to raise her rank this way.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pang Yue was a support soul pet trainer, and she was at the low class dominator rank. With a Devil Soul, her strength was now capable of increasing. Thus, if they were able to increase her strength on this Wupan expedition, she would follow in the footsteps of Ye Qingzi and Xia Zhixian as New Moon Land’s third support soul pet trainer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng immediately nodded his head and said: “Chu Mu, you have some good ideas.”&nbsp;</span></p>
