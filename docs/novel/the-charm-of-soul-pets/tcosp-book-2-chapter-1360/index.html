 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang creased his brows and asked: “You’re nominating someone to enter Imprint Valley?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Fu nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The adjacent Tang Ang first gave a respectful greeting to Madam Fu, but when he heard her mention Imprint Valley, his eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imprint Valley was an amazing place. Inside was an ancient formation that was divided into eight locations. These eight locations could gather the energy of heaven and earth together. Regardless if it were a person or soul pet, if they were able to cultivate in the eye of the formation, their strength would inevitably fly up!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Tang Zhuo had entered the immortal rank, he was unable to find a suitable opportunity to cross the divide between the pseudo immortal and low immortal rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the immortal rank, his master, Tang Ang, gave him a bit of help. But after the immortal rank, he had to completely rely on himself to cultivate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imprint Valley was a training ground Tang Zhuo had coveted for a long time. If he were able to cultivate there for a year, allowing his soul pets to absorb ample heaven and earth energy, he would both be able to stabilize his strength after just stepping into the immortal rank, as well as give himself a perfect passing from the pseudo immortal to low immortal rank. This meant that the low class immortal rank wasn’t far off!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of cultivators allowed into Imprint Valley were extremely limited. For a long time now, Imprint Valley’s formation had been severely damaged, and could not be used like it was before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a short while ago, someone released the news that a person proficient with formations had completely mended Imprint Valley’s formation. Not only did it have its original gathering heaven and earth energy effect, but its absorption speed was even faster than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang had personally gone to check this, and had even told Tang Zhuo that Imprint Valley was an extremely good opportunity to enter the immortal rank. If he were to cultivate there for a year, his chances of entering the low class immortal rank wouldn’t be so uncertain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo was the leader of the younger generation, but within the immortal rank domain, the pseudo immortal rank was ultimately still unable to satisfy his requirements. At least, Tang Zhuo was certain that there were young experts stronger than him, for example, Divine Sect’s Lin Mengling. This woman was so strong that Tang Zhuo simply had no answer to her!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Imprint Valley belongs to Divine Sect so Divine Sect’s absolute genius, Lin Mengling, will definitely take one spot. One other spot will be given to New Moon Land’s King, Chu Mu, according to Saintess Yu’s wishes.” Madam Gao intentionally glanced at Tang Zhuo before slowly speaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Ang heard this, his expression changed and he said: “Madam Gao, didn’t you say before that the one spot would be given to my disciple, Tang Zhuo? Why has the nomination suddenly been given to someone else? Isn’t this inappropriate?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang couldn’t directly rebuke Saintess Yu’s decision change, since this woman’s influence was indeed very strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, people that knew of more information about Imprint Valley’s formation knew that it was Saintess Yu who had mended it. Without her, Imprint Valley’s formation wouldn’t have gotten better. Divine Sect giving a spot to Lin Mengling had even required a favor from Saintess Yu, so obviously the second spot would be to Saintess Yu to decide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang and Madam Gao were rather friendly with each other. Tang Ang had wanted to give his disciple greater development for the future, so he had used his friendship with Madam Gao to recommend Tang Zhuo as the second person to enter Imprint Valley.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Saintess Yu said before that she would only consider it. Normally when she says that she will consider it, this matter is 80% or 90% confirmed. However, I never expected last night for the Saintess to tell me that the nomination would be given to New Moon Land’s King, Chu Mu, who just arrived in Zhengming Main City. I was also very shocked by this.” said Madam Gao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The adjacent Tang Zhuo was having problems sitting still.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know that the person who had mended Imprint Valley’s formation was Saintess Yu. When he thought of that day when Saintess Yu asked Chu Mu to stay behind, he wondered whether it was to tell him about Imprint Valley!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, Tang Zhuo couldn’t give up the Imprint Valley cultivation spot!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there may have been other ways that he could use to increase his strength, being able to spend an entire year cultivating with Divine Sect’s exceptional female disciple, Lin Mengling, was something every outstanding expert yearned for in their dreams.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the younger generation, Divine Sect’s Lin Mengling’s status was unquestionably an unreachable goddess. How could Tang Zhuo’s heart not stir at an opportunity to near her?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Madam Gao, Imprint Valley is a cultivation holy land for us younger generation members. The spots and resources are both limited. As for Lin Mengling having an unconditional spot, I have nothing to say. However, won’t it be difficult to convince the other numerous outstanding experts, who have been diligently cultivating for this spot, to let someone, who has never been to Zhengming Main City before and has no reputation, obtain this spot?” hastily said Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo understood his master’s character. He was already at the retirement age, and no longer fought for a lot of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Tang Ang were to be softhearted for this kind of thing and give up the spot, he would have to find the strength to breakthrough on his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, after Chu Mu’s provocation, Tang Zhuo didn’t have much goodwill towards Chu Mu. If he let this person obtain the spot, he wouldn’t be able to greatly increase his strength, let alone obtain the opportunity to form good relations with Lin Mengling. In the future, his status as the leader of the younger generation would probably be taken away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not give it up. He could not give up the spot!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang presently felt a bit awkward. He really did want to fight for this spot for his disciple. However, this spot was decided by Saintess Yu. It was inappropriate for him to use his status to suppress a saintess type person who had meteorically risen in Zhengming Continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Zhuo is right. Although I don’t know why Saintess Yu has any interest in that young king, Imprint Valley ultimately is a cultivation spot which the younger generations of the larger factions yearn for in their dreams. Randomly giving a cultivation spot to someone with no name for himself will incite mass dissatisfaction.” Tang Ang rubbed his silver and white beard as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo and Tang Ang said very similar things. But when Tang Ang, this leader rank person, said this, both Madam Gao and Saintess Yu had to consider his feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Madam Gao revealed an awkward expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Originally, I thought Saintess Yu would give the spot to the winner of the Outstanding Experts Competition…” added Tang Ang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo was the most likely winner of the competition. Thus, by saying this, he was letting Madam Gao know that by giving the spot to Tang Zhuo, it would be fully deserved and nobody would oppose this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Land’s Chu Mu is a low key person, but both myself and Saintess Yu have personally witnessed his strength. He had no interest in this competition so he didn’t participate…” when Madam Gao got to this point, she intentionally threw a glance at Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you’re saying that this person can’t be bothered to participate in the most influential Outstanding Experts Competition within our Zhengming Continent?” Tang Ang raised his brows and added emphasis to his tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang knew that Chu Mu was Cloud Gate Elder’s disciple. Moreover, he was also going to fight against Tang Zhuo eventually. Thus, Madam Gao was essentially saying his own disciple was inferior to Cloud Gate Elder’s disciple. Tang Ang obviously was unhappy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not necessarily. In fact, you probably know that the experts of Outstanding Experts Competition don’t necessarily represent the strongest young experts of Zhengming Continent. There will always be people who don’t participate in the competition. Some of these people that I know of include Demon Beast Palace’s Yun Qingshan, Beiming City’s young City Lord, Xia Yin, Old Immortal’s disciple, Little Immortal Monarch, and Divine Sect’s genius, Lin Mengling… these people probably aren’t weaker than Young Master Tang Zhuo, right?” said Madam Gao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang had obviously heard of these people. While Outstanding Experts Competition was indeed the most influential competition, it didn’t mean that there weren’t young experts who sat above the competition. The four people Madam Gao mentioned were genuine experts that few people knew about. Moreover, these people were both young and strong. Among them were a few that even Gate Master level people didn’t dare to provoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Madam, isn’t it inappropriate for you to place New Moon Land’s King, Chu Mu, with them? If he really does sit equally with them, I, Tang Zhuo, will renounce my spot. But if his strength is just average and this opportunity is given to him, wouldn’t that just be wasting the extremely finite resources of Imprint Valley?” said Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang nodded his head and said to Madam Gao: “How about this. Tang Zhuo and Chu Mu were already going to fight. How about we have the decided spot go to the winner of the fight?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right!!” Tang Zhuo immediately nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being provoked multiple times, Tang Zhuo could no longer wait to fight Chu Mu. He wanted to make this fellow, who had suddenly appeared, know who actually called the shots in Zhengming Main City!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… isn’t this unfair for Chu Mu? The spot was originally supposed to be given to him by Saintess Yu.” said Madam Gao awkwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s have a fair wager. I will take out my chips to gamble with his nomination chip. The winner will take possession of the loser’s gambling chip!” hastily said Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo wasn’t afraid of this fight. He was only afraid that this nomination spot would, for no apparent reason, be taken away by Chu Mu!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need to solicit Chu Mu’s opinion. Let’s wait until I ask?” Madam Gao secretly rejoiced, but maintained her awkward expression on the outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we’ll have to trouble Madam Gao.” faintly smiled Tang Ang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything would be decided by strength. Tang Ang enjoyed this method of resolving things. Moreover, his disciple, Tang Zhuo, was a good fighter; he obviously wouldn’t be afraid of the opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ang defeating Cloud Gate Elder was something that had happened a few hundred years ago. Could the loser’s disciple really compare to his own disciple?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was currently a leader of humanity. On the other hand, who actually remembered Cloud Gate Elder?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought of this, Tang Ang subconsciously stroked his beard. Being able to teach an outstanding disciple before he retired was a very gratifying thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after, Madam Gao returned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, did he dare accept the fight?” hastily asked Tang Zhuo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He agreed, but the requirement he requested is a bit demanding,” said Madam Gao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What requirement?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He wants to participate in Outstanding Experts Competition, and he wants to have full right to the winnings obtained by the top placers of Outstanding Experts Competition,” said Madam Gao.&nbsp;</span></p>
