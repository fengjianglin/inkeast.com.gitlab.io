After all, even the northern territory distribution was determined by the rankings of this competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The final Outstanding Experts Competition was done in Divine Sect. To the west of Divine Sect was a floating battlefield called the Hovering Mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hovering Mountain’s magnitude caused Chu Mu to remember the Folding Skies Bewildering World. The difference was that these floating mountains were all stationary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a few hundred mountains. They were, in reality, just fairly large rocks, of which the bottoms and tops were covered by vine-like plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, there would be white fog. Within it, the mountains looked no different than an average landscape. However, knowing that there were tens of thousands of meters of sky underneath them, the landscape becomes all the more impressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Around the Hovering Mountains were barriers that were set up. These constituted the scattered spectator stands. Considering that dominator rank techniques could easily reach a hundred kilometers, the spectators’ seats definitely had powerful barriers protecting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were eight people in the final battle of the Outstanding Experts Competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These eight people. to a certain degree. represented the most outstanding young experts within Zhengming Continent. Those that came to spectate mostly came from the largest factions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the competition, tens of thousands of people sat down in their seats according to Divine Sect’s arrangements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect didn’t try to treat everyone equally. According to the spectator’s strength and position, they were arranged to sit in different places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those of a Kingdom level, those of a Realm level, and those of a Boundary level were all sat in different places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spirit emperors, dominators, immortals, Border Soldiers, Border Generals, Border Commanders, and Border Lords…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could tell whether someone was powerful or weak just by their seated position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the main Hovering Mountain, in a seat that could look down upon all the other mountains, sat Divine Sect’s Old Sect Master Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Outstanding Experts Competition was ultimately a battle for the younger generation. Having a sect master of Divine Sect appearing was already an honor for the younger experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the old sect master were the leading figures of Demon Beast Palace, Xuan Gate, Elemental Sect, and Departed Spirit Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the only ones who arrived were Demon Beast Palace’s Yin Ce and Elemental Sect Guo Peng. The other two seats were empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below them were Border Lords, each representing the most powerful people of Zhengming Continent. Though there weren’t many of them, each one could cause a tremble throughout Zhengming Continent with any move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, not everyone was an immortal rank expert here. Many other people with special identities sat with them or were of even higher position, despite having a lower rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some were kings that had independent lands of great power and resources. Some were leaders of families that were well known throughout the seas. Others were famous people with immense followings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though these people may not be here for their younger generations, they were people the competition had to invite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength pyramid could be somewhat seen through the spacing of the seats. After Chu Mu entered the main Hovering Mountain, he took special note of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu first saw the two Border Lords Huang Zefeng and Li Moyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their position was near the lower end of this main Hovering Mountain. In their own borders, Huang Zefeng and Li Moyu were the utmost kings. One sentence was enough to turn the entire territory upside down. They had many dominator ranks beneath them that they could command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in Divine Dect in front of more experts, even as Border Lords they lost their splendor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Liu BInglan sat very close to the two Border Lords, and were also near the bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, New Moon land’s representatives appearing on the main Hovering Mountain could show that their status in Zhengming Continent was far better than in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Yu, we’ve helped you arrange seating, please come with me.” A young Divine Sect member came and said respectfully to Yu Bo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Bo sat behind Liu Binglan, fitting of his identity of Sacred Guard Elder. However, Yu Bo’s name must have been widely known in Zhengming Continent. Not long after he appeared, someone had recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No worries, I can see it from here too.” Yu Bo waved his hand dismissively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Sect disciple was embarassed, not knowing whether he should stay or leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Yu, please don’t make it difficult for your younger generation, my master told me to…..” The Divine Sect disciple started.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Bo stopped caring about this Divine Sect disciple. He knew that Chu Mu was rather unfamiliar with the Zhengming Main Continent experts, so he started describing them from the highest seated Sect Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s Xiao Sect Master, his position doesn’t need much explaining. Qingzi saved his life, an extreme favor to both Sect Master Xiao himself, as well as all of Divine Sect.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s be more detailed, or else I don’t know just how powerful this old Sect Master is.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, you really are realistic.” Yu Bo laughed and continued, “Let’s put it this way, Huang Zefeng and Li Moyu are at the bottom of the immortal rank. They govern the first to third rank Border Territories. These people are usually around the low class dominator rank. You young people are still a bottleneck away from them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then there are the middle ranks of the immortal rank. These people in the middle are usually the managers of some factions, chiefs, or middle-rank Border Lords. These people control the most power in Zhengming Continent, and are the people most experts recognize as the highest authority. En, en, there are at most ten here today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These people are all at at least the immortal rank but fluctuate up and down. More importantly, the authority they control means that a single command can move many immortal ranks to obey without hesitation. They are easily the people with the most authority in this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These people are individuals that New Moon Land can’t dare to communicate with yet. A single command from them can cause New Moon Land to disappear from existence.” Yu Bo said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Following that are the upper ranks of immortal rank. Today, there are only five. Old Sect Master Xiao, Divine Sect’s Magistrate Xiao, Demon Beast Palace’s Yin Ce, Elemental Sect Peng Meng, and Tang Zhuo’s master Tang Ang.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was surprised, “Elder Yue’s enemy is that powerful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was always wondering how powerful Cloud Gate Elder’s enemy was. He never expected him to be on the level of a Divine Sect Old Sect Master, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, having lived a few hundred years, how can they not be powerful? Though this person has a deep grudge against Elder Yue, those things have long passed. It’s about time Tang Ang retired. In a fight between disciples, even if you kill all of Tang Zhuo’s soul pets, he won’t release his anger on anyone. If his disciple is worse than others, what can he say?” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These people, to a certain degree, represent the leaders of humanity. They may still hold great authority, but many others are attempting to supersede life and reach Undying Rank along with other powerful organisms.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what objective they have, their positions are easily the tip of humanity, and are truly the leader rank experts. Other than using our spirits to respect and fear them, what else can we do?” Yu Bo let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Yu Bo’s expression, Chu Mu had an approximate guess at which rank Yu Bo was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was a curious individual. The concept of Undying rank had always floated around his head. He heard Princess Jin Rou speak about it, and the Heavenly Boundary Monument also mentioned Undying Rank organisms…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are there even stronger people beyond them?” Chu Mu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Bo paused. Originally, he thought the leaders of humanity were enough to give the kid something to look up to and sigh at, yet he didn’t expect Chu Mu’s ambitions to be this large.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, immortal rank seems to be split into pseudo, low, middle, high, and top tier like all other ranks. However, you know how long it took for Tang Ang to go from pseudo immortal rank to high class immortal rank?” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From the moment Elder Yue started guarding the Cloud Gate until today, you can give it a guess.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu only knew that Cloud Gate Elder had been in the Heavenly Mountains for a few hundred years. Coiuld it be that Tang Ang spent hundreds of years just to raise three minor ranks?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re already luckier than the rest of us, able to step into a rank that most people will never reach. However, many prodigies seem to meet the same barrier. It feels as if fate finally gave up on you, and you would remain in the same rank no matter how much longer you live….. This is why many people give up on training, and instead turn to power and authority. It isn’t that they wanted to give up, but instead, they knew clearly that they would never improve anymore, and can only find change through authority.” Yu Bo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded. Yu Bo was telling him that every rank in immortal rank could be a barrier that traps one for the rest of their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu wasn’t fearful of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one hand, White Three’s self-sacrifice changed his blood, and caused Chu Mu to gain power that others could only dream of. Breaking through this barrier, Chu Mu’s other soul pets naturally would keep up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Ning Maner’s special presence meant that Chu Mu basically had a Messiah Tree. This utmost treasure was something even these leaders of humanity fought head over heels for…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu tilted his head, and glanced at his little Mo Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was little Mo Xie’s species mutations really going to stop here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had a feeling that she would become even stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuwuwu~~~~~” Little Mo Xie opened her bleary eyes, and glanced questioningly at Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu rubbed her furry ears, and Mo Xie closed her eyes in satisfaction, her nine little tails lightly swaying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just how far would this sleepy, snacking, battle-hungry, and proud little fellow go? Even Chu Mu didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would there be one day where he would pass away from old age, while she continued to push the limits of life? Would little Mo Xie one day get used to no longer using his shoulders as her most comfortable bed?</span></p>
