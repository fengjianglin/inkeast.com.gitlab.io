 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t use his mental voice to communicate with Yu Suo. However, the longer Chu Mu went without saying anything, the more Yu Suo doubted Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Yu Suo wouldn’t show any weakness either. If Chu Mu wasn’t going to say anything, she would not say anything either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After each individual introduction, it was time to determine who had obtained the Eternal Blessing. Everyone’s faces revealed traces of expectation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This opportunity was not something that could be demanded, not even by those young talents with huge influence behind them. But if they could obtain the Eternal Blessing, it would be a huge strength boost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes fell on the Saintess. They saw her move closer to Madam Fu’s ear and quietly speak a few sentences. Madam Fu quickly understood, and nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qing Border’s Wan Xitong, Wo Border’s Chen Xian, Elemental Sect’s Tuo Yun, and Ze Border’s Huang Yufei. The four of you please come forth. Saintess Yu will bestow the blessing upon you.” said Madam Fu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four people that were named instantly went mad with happiness, and rushed to stand up from their seats!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These four people hadn’t had extremely outstanding performances in the Outstanding Experts Competition. This could be seen from where they were sitting. Thus, contrary to their expectations, they had become the lucky ones, and were chosen by Saintess Yu in front of all these outstanding talents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei was unable to stifle the excitement in his heart. The moment he stood up, he suddenly felt like a crane in a flock of chickens, and held his head and chest up high!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t I say so? Li Qingqing, I said before that Saintess Yu had been paying attention to me all this while, and that it wasn’t purely a coincidence!” Huang Yufei seemed to have boiled over as he bragged with incomparable excitement to Li Qingqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingqing showed an expression full of disbelief when she heard the results. Was Huang Yufei actually right? Did Saintess Yu really show interest in this dumb man?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no reason for it. There were so many young talents present. Tang Zhuo, Xin Xin, and Han Erxing’s names had already shaken the realm. Perhaps these four people were outstanding in their own territories. However, when placed among this group of outstanding talents, they were certainly inferior…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The audience instantly erupted into an uproar as various discussions broke out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Tang Zhuo, Xin Xin, and Han Erxing were extremely shocked. They never expected Saintess Yu to not choose them, and instead to bestow this rare blessing to, in their opinions, nameless fellows!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Saintess Yu, may I ask what your criteria for choosing whom to bestow the blessing upon is?” Tang Zhuo couldn’t hold himself back and asked this question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until now, Tang Zhuo and the others had all been living a spoiled life. Any possible honor and attention had been placed onto them. They felt that they absolutely had to obtain the Eternal Blessing this time. Other people were at most accessories to their story of life and at most, one of these accessories could be bestowed a blessing for ‘appearances’ sake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, none of them received the blessing. All of the blessings had been bestowed onto people they looked down upon. This feeling of neglect wasn’t easy to bear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Zhuo, this is Saintess Yu’s choice. In the Saintess’s eyes, there is no room for nobility, looks, and strength. Everything comes down to fate.” Madam Fu knew that Tang Zhuo and the others were dissatisfied and calmly explained to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fate? Why do I feel like you’re grasping at straws here.” Lu Fenxue muttered at a very timely occasion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Gao swept her eyes over Lu Fenxue and coldly harrumphed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Fenxue was slightly afraid of Madam Gao, and didn’t say anything further.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Tang Zhuo and the others mentioned their dissatisfaction, nobody actually rudely objected to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four winners rose up and arrived in front of Saintess Yu. Their expressions were full of excitement from obtaining the Eternal Blessing. As they walked up, they felt everyone’s unwilling and jealous gazes. Although the four of them looked calm, their expressions still betrayed their inner thoughts: they hadn’t obtained a high ranking in the Outstanding Experts Competition, nor did they obtain much attention; however, they were able to blow off steam through the Eternal Blessings!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei was a rather simple-minded fellow. When he walked past Tang Zhuo, he wore a look of arrogance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guo Shi, who was sitting behind Tang Zhuo, coldly muttered: “Trash is just trash. Even after obtaining some abilities, it will still be trash. Do you really think that after obtaining a single dewdrop of the Eternal Blessing that you’ll be able to sit equally with our Tang Zhuo?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei stopped in his tracks. If those words had just been uttered by Tang Zhuo or Huang Yufei, who knew he was of a much higher status than him, he wouldn’t dare retort. However, Guo Shi was but a mere lackey of Tang Zhuo. Huang Yufei had a very straightforward personality and obviously couldn’t tolerate such statements. His entire face instantly flushed red!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you just say?!” Huang Yufei angrily glared at Guo Shi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Are you ears not working?” Guo Shi happened to enter the last rank of outstanding talents. He really didn’t pay attention to someone of Huang Yufei’s rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… would you believe it if I chopped you up right now?!” Huang Yufei angrily pointed at Guo Shi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With your skills? Don’t forget in the competition who was lying like a dog on the ground. You weren’t even able to beat a single one of my main pets…” mocked Guo Shi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the competition, Guo Shi had managed to easily defeat Huang Yufei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the one hand, Guo Shi was dissatisfied with a trash like this obtaining an incomparably treasured Eternal Blessing. On the other hand, he had seen him flaunt in front of Tang Zhuo and thus wanted to teach him a lesson.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Huang Yufei is as stupid as a bug! Can he not hold back the pride in his heart? Those other people are all an arrogant bunch and since they didn’t obtain a blessing, they’re obviously holding back their anger. Yet, he still went up and provoked them. He really infuriates me!” Li Qingqing was both worried and angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Fu obviously wouldn’t let any conflict break out, and ordered them to return to their seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, Madam Fu had servant girls gift a nurturing dew to every person who had come today. This nurturing dew wasn’t an easily obtainable treasure either, and nobody was stupid enough to reject such a gift.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After giving out the dew, Madam Fu told everyone to leave. The people who didn’t obtain the Eternal Blessing had faces of pity, and could only leave with their consolation prizes. As for the four that obtained the Eternal Blessing, their faces were full of happiness and when they left, they were surrounded by many people. They wanted to see what the Eternal Blessing dew looked like.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, New Moon Land’s Chu Mu, the Saintess asks that you stay behind. There’s something she wishes to discuss.” Just as everyone was leaving, Madam Fu suddenly looked like she had remembered something and specifically called out to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment she said these words, over a hundred people turned around and looked towards Chu Mu before looking at Saintess Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the entire bestowal and choosing process, Saintess Yu hadn’t said a single thing. Even to those she bestowed the Eternal Dew upon, she had only used her eyes to convey meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, just as everyone believed they wouldn’t be able to hear her voice today, Madam Gao suddenly wanted a man, whose name they had never heard of before, to stay behind. Apparently there was also something to discuss?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is New Moon Land’s Chu Mu?” asked someone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure. I’ve never heard of him before.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wasn’t New Moon Land’s Outstanding Expert Competition representative Mu Qingyi- Upper Official Mu?” said a Divine Sect member.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where did this Chu Mu come from? Who has fought him before? What’s his strength like?” Xin Xin creased his brows and asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve never heard his name before, but I just saw him and Huang Yufei sitting together. He can’t be strong at all.” coldly harrumphed Guo Shi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What on earth is going on with the Saintess? She’s not choosing any of us outstanding people. Instead, she’s been placing attention on those nameless people!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo’s eyes stared at Saintess Yu. He couldn’t see through her at all. Twice now, had she neglected the true outstanding talents. This left Tang Zhuo with an uncomfortable feeling. Moreover, although he had maintained his elegance and hadn’t ridiculed and mocked Huang Yufei, Guo Shi’s words had been exactly what he was thinking. He just didn’t say anything due to his cultivated manners.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Chu Mu had sat with Huang Yufei, what reason did this trash have to obtain the Saintess’s interest?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Saintess is truly profoundly unfathomable. Whatever, nobodies will ultimately have their own useless fortunes. It won’t have any effect.” Xin Xin calmly laughed, and casually turned around and left. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhuo gave a deep look at Chu Mu, and lifted up the corners of his mouth. He also adjusted his mindset and turned to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others more or less spoke a few bitter words and left Guang Moon Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Yufei and Li Qingqing were stunned for a long while before they finally reacted. Huang Yufei originally felt he was extremely, extremely lucky, as he was able to obtain a blessing in an exceptionally difficult circumstance. Yet, who would have thought the ultimate winner would be Chu Mu, who had sat next to him and not said anything. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t the two of you wait outside.” Madam Gao glanced at Huang Yufei and Li Qingqing as she urged them to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them reluctantly looked at Chu Mu as they left the flower garden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night scene was captivating, and with the fragrance of flowers in the air, the beauty of the garden seemed even more enchanting under the dim candlelights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Chu Mu, Madam Gao, and Saintess Yu remained inside the garden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu waved her hand, indicating for Madam Gao to leave first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Gao curiously examined Chu Mu before slowly leaving. However, before she left, she heard Saintess Yu address the man as something. What she called this man-made Madam Gao to show an expression full of shock, and it was a while before she came back to her senses!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo gritted her teeth, and her face of peerless beauty that was close to a demoness’s wore a humiliated anger!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it weren’t for the fact she had given her heart to this man, Yu Suo would never call the person she absolutely hated as “master”!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What game are you playing?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu slowly walked up to the seat that originally belonged to Saintess Yu and, without a trace of politeness, sat down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many outsiders here before, and he already felt aggrieved that he hadn’t exposed her identity. Now that everyone had left, Chu Mu was naturally more casual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has nothing to do with you.” coldly said Yu Suo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m curious as to why you gave the Eternal Blessing dew to those people of average talents? In my opinion, I think you’re trying to take control of this group of talents,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu saw that Yu Suo didn’t respond, and formed a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Suo looked at Chu Mu’s smile and felt uncomfortable all over. Finally, she explained:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Zhuo, Xin Xin, and that group are all arrogant and prideful people. I won’t be able to get them to willingly serve me by just giving them a bit of grace. Instead, the more I neglect them, the easier it is to incite the arrogance inside them. I’ll wait until I neglect them or even make them feel despair before I give them a bit of grace. This will be much more effective than bestowing them grace when they are living a favored life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s what it was. You are really good at playing with people’s hearts.” Chu Mu nodded his head. This really wasn’t a bad method.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many men are this despicable.” coldly said Yu Suo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sentence obviously grouped Chu Mu inside it.&nbsp;</span></p>
