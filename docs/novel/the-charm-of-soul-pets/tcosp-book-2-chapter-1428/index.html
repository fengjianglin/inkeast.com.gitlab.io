 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not know how many Monument Tear Individuals or Fake Monument Tear Individuals had appeared in this Imprint Valley. However, all of them seemed to be stronger than him. He really had no idea how he was going to handle them without the Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu took a glance into the distance. He was not that far away from the Divine Sect entrance, but a group of people were approaching him from that direction, and he would be surrounded very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Do I really have to give up on this Monument Tear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling the two Seven Sins Fox who were leaning on each other and were quietly waiting for their death, Chu Mu felt that it would be a sacrilege if he were to hand over this Monument Tear to those greedy people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s subordinates were not weak at all. Despite Chu Mu gaining some advantage against them, it was not really an easy matter to finish them off in a short time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom~!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thunderous explosion rang out, the sky that was covered in dense dark clouds suddenly began to collapse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This looked as if a black mirror had suddenly shattered, revealing the deep lightless chaos behind it. The lightless chaos stirred and sucked in the surrounding light rays, clouds and particles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the collapse started, an intense spatial swirl appeared below the collapsed region. That was the place where Night was fighting against a snake dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night was faster in its reaction and it immediately escaped from the battle area after sensing a strange fluctuation in space. It ran back to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, that snake dragon was slower in both its reaction and speed. When the soul pet trainer sensed the instability of space, the suction force of the swirl had already enveloped his snake dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That snake dragon ignored it at first and maintained its speed as it chased after Night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is it so slow?” wondered the soul pet trainer with a dragon tattoo on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It felt as if his snake dragon was being dragged by something from behind and had difficulty moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Qing, behind you!” Suddenly, Enforcer She shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet trainer called Su Qing thought that the Night Dream Beast had appeared again and so he hurriedly turned his snake dragon around to spit out a mouthful of snake fluid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the snake fluid flew out though, it was immediately sucked into the expanding black hole. When Su Qing realized that there was an endless darkness and abyssal-like chaos behind him, his face instantly paled in fear and he urged his snake dragon to speed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His snake dragon was already moving at the fastest speed possible. There was a powerful spatial swirl around the black hole. This swirl would pull in any matter around it. It would be almost impossible to break free from the pull unless one was fast enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hole kept expanding, so the suction force of the spatial swirl also kept strengthening too. The snake dragon’s speed was getting slower and slower. Eventually, it looked as if its tail was tied onto something and it could no longer move forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people who were fighting on the ground also broke out of their battle to watch the change happening in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Save...... Save me, you guys...... someone come save me!” Su Qing lost all color on his face. The spatial black hole behind him was like the gullet of a monster, it would be the end for him if he were to get swallowed by it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else was on the ground. When a spatial black hole of such a large size suddenly appeared above them, even if they had reached Immortal rank, no one was brave enough to willingly approach that gate of hell. Nobody dared to fly near that region, including Zeng Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Qing and his soul pet were in a situation as if they had fallen into a swamp, they would slowly continue to sink if nobody pulled them out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gradually, Su Qing and his snake dragon were getting pulled further in. The snake dragon’s tail sank into the dark region of emptiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snake dragon did not feel any pain at all. However, everyone could tell from the way it was desperately twisting its body that it was completely in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Qing was still shouting desperately for help. His voice was getting further and further away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hole had suddenly appeared in the sky. A two hundred meter long snake dragon was slowly getting sucked into the black hole. Snake dragons were already considered huge. However, when one was slowly getting swallowed by the black hole, it looked as if a little worm was falling into an abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Su Qing and his snake dragon were both completely swallowed up by the black hole. The black hole and the spatial swirl were still expanding. Those tall mountains began to shake violently. Suddenly, loud cracking sounds rang out everywhere and those mountains were literally pulled out of the ground. Everyone watched as a large chunk of the mountain got sucked into the air and sank into the black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the spatial swirl expanded more and more, some of the smaller rocks on the ground started floating up and were getting sucked into the black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene was truly mind blowing. This merciless devouring was a real natural disaster. What could an Immortal rank creature do against it? In the end, it still got sucked by the black hole into an unknown death world without any chance to struggle at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long and the remaining few Snake Dragon Faction members were a little spaced out. They had just watched one of their members getting swallowed up by the black hole. Nobody dared to go to rescue him. It was not because they were cold-blooded and selfish, but that they knew that they might also get sucked into the black hole if they went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Imprint Valley’s collapsing state is getting more and more severe,” said Princess Jin Rou warily as she looked at the black hole in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded and looked in the direction of the exit worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That place better not collapse too, or we would really be buried in this Imprint Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snake Dragon Faction members took a long time to snap back to reality. They seemed to have been too astonished by the phenomenon of the spatial collapse. They had already lost their fighting spirit as they knew that they would only end up dead here if they did not leave soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Eminence Zeng Long was even more furious now. He had brought a group of Immortal rank experts from his Snake Dragon Faction into this Imprint Valley for the sake of obtaining the Monument Tear. If he went back empty-handed, then his position as the Eminence might not be safe any longer after having lost so many of his subordinates!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of his rage was pointed towards Chu Mu, and he glared at Chu Mu with vicious eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, he directly ignored the interception from the Martial Cloud Dragon and flew straight towards Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Cloud Dragon’s claw blocked the path of the golden snake dragon. The golden snake dragon did not make any attempt to dodge at all and it simply allowed the dragon claw to tear its skin off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long ignored the flowing blood. The golden snake dragon jerked heavily and shook off the Martial Cloud Dragon’s claws, then it flew straight towards Chu Mu once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon was very fast. Its body reflected a golden glow as it shot towards Chu Mu like a huge ballista!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal rank’s tremendous power could easily damage the stability of space. The space along the path it took was damaged to some extent when Zeng Long flew over it with such crazy speed. A long and deep tear had appeared in the path that Zeng Long’s golden snake dragon flew through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In normal situations, the tear would repair itself in a short time. However, the Imprint Valley was currently in a severe state of collapse. Once a spatial tear appeared, then not only would it not be repaired, the tear would instead worsen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord Eminence!” shouted Enforcer She when she saw that the tear was opening up further and further and it became a crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crack kept expanding and had transformed into another black hole. The surrounding rocks were sucked in instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long turned around and saw that a crack-shaped spatial black hole was tailing right behind his golden snake dragon. His expression changed immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right away, Zeng Long ordered his golden snake dragon to slow down, not daring to damage the fragile space any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s golden snake dragon was strong indeed. However, what could it really do before a collapsing space? Only death awaited it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After slowing down, the crack no longer trailed behind it. However, the torn space behind was still expanding. The suction force was also spreading out bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I advise you to stop with your reckless actions. If you create another spatial black hole or two, then this entire region will lose all support and immediately collapse. A spatial black hole of over thousands of kilometers would open. Do you think any of us can survive that?” criticized Chu Mu with a frown as he looked at Zeng Long who was already before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, it’s you who will be the one dying!” Zeng Long ignored Chu Mu’s words and ordered his golden snake dragon to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon’s body suddenly bloomed out with a golden light. Its long body shot out countless pythons made up of light rays. Those pythons wriggled fiercely in the air and on the ground, swarming towards Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“White Devil,” Chu Mu issued an order to White Devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Devil understood Chu Mu’s intention clearly. It casually swung at the space in front of it. A bright tear appeared right in front of Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no need for White Devil to guide the spatial storm. Once a tear appeared in the space, the tear itself rapidly expanded and the powerful spatial swirl sucked in all of those light pythons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a moment ago, there were thousands of light pythons swarming in. And now after a few seconds, all of them were sucked into this normal tear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the tears in space were in the process of worsening. Before anyone realized, the biggest black hole in the sky was already pressing down on them. Chu Mu traced along the black hole and realized that the region of space behind it was already completely swallowed up. It was possible that this black hole had extended from the spatial collapse that he had created before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, this also meant that the entire region of space from the back of the sun to this dark land had already become a spatial black hole. It had become the fatal zone that even Immortal rank creatures could not survive in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The powerful suction force of the swirl approached them. Zeng Long raised his head and saw that the tears and cracks that he and Chu Mu had made were gradually connecting to the largest black hole in the sky. The collapsing speed was accelerating even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By now, Zeng Long had no choice but to be wary. If he created another crack or two, then it might really end up as what Chu Mu said. A black hole of over thousands of kilometers would manifest itself and then nobody could escape anymore!</span></p>
