 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li had made the trip to Lost Desolate Garden to tell Chu Mu this. Indeed, Chu Mu had spent a year and a half training, and everyone was a bit worried. Adding on the fact that someone was coming to administer their territory, this made the Three Great Palaces very worried. The feeling was that a fierce tiger was about to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s training had finished, and there was no need to continue staying in eastern Wild Forest. Thus, he rode on his Dead Dream and returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, Old Han and Old Wen decided to take a trip to the outside. Thus, they returned with Chu Mu to Wanxiang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dead Dream’s flying speed was very fast. Before long, Chu Mu had entered Wanxiang City’s territory from the distant Eastern Wild Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s Dead Dream had practically become his trademark. When the Three Great Palace’s people saw a beautiful streak of dark purple lightning flit across the sky, they knew Chu Mu had returned. Everyone looked up, wanting to see what the human realm’s strongest human looked like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t like showing his face in public. Although everyone from three years old to 100 years old in this world knew his name, there were only a few who had met Chu Mu before. He could genuinely be described as a reclusive hidden dragon. He was extremely mysterious and profound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After nearly two years of reconstruction, Wanxiang City had returned to its former glory. When Chu Mu flew over in the sky, he couldn’t feel any of the scars left by the war on this city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to Xiangrong City, Wanxiang City was much more majestic and boundless. It was like a vigorously beating heart. After the war, the bustle and hustle was much more prominent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the air, as Chu Mu looked down at the mighty and grand city, he watched the throngs of people walking through the street.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He remembered the first time he stepped into this city, he had felt a sense of overbearingness. But now it was him that was standing at the highest point...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they flew straight across the city, the patrolling aerial guards could only shockingly watch the incomparable dark purple lightning with envy as Dead Dream beautifully and freely slowly disappeared in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passing through the inner city, Chu Mu instantly saw the silver, gold, and blue colored palaces of Wanxiang Altar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three altars represented the factions of the Three Great Palace’s factions. However, after the great crisis, the Three Great Palaces allied together. There was no longer a barrier between the palaces, senior elder, elder, and Palace master. Instead, there was added a corridor between them and a gorgeous aerial bridge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu had left this place, the rubble had just begun its reconstruction. In the blink of an eye, it had become so majestic and boundless. The destruction had come so quickly and the reconstruction of civilization was just as quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very center of the Three Great Palaces was an imposing and majestic great palace. This great palace was composed of gold color, colored by blue and formed by pillars and angled brims to create three palaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the magnificent palace, Chu Mu was certain the Three Great Palace’s had indeed become rich and imposing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? Why have the Three Joined Palaces opened today? Did something big happen?” Old Li glanced at the Three Joined Palaces and spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Joined Palaces had opened, and on the 1200 flights of stairs stood a total of 1000 guards. A majestic carpet was laid out to the bottom of the stairs, indicating that a meeting was in session!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could the people from beyond Cloud Gate have arrived?” muttered Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coming early wasn’t as fitting as coming at a timely occasion, and Chu Mu happened to have come at a timely occasion. Promptly, Chu Mu urged the Dead Dream to land outside the Three Great Palace’s plaza.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu, Old Han, Old Wen, and Old Li jumped off from the Dead Dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The holy guards saw the casual, cold, and fierce Dead Dream land and naturally knew who had returned. Promptly, they all kneeled on the ground for Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thousand adorned holy guards had all kneeled so fast that Chu Mu wasn’t even prepared for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holy Guard Captain Zhuo Nong was standing on the outside and looked at Chu Mu. A smile immediately rose on his face as he said; “King Chu, you’ve finally returned.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu…” Chu Mu bitterly laughed. Who had given him such a beautiful title. Even if he wanted to be low key, it was impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu waved his hand at Zhuo Nong and said: “Uncle Zhuo, have your people stand up. They scared me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Showing formality is a must.” seriously said Holy Guard Captain Zhuo Nong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the situation inside?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s people from the Dark Heaven Ocean World.” said Zhuo Nong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not people from beyond the Cloud Gate?” Old Li was stunned and was silently confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhuo Nong naturally didn’t know what was “beyond the Cloud Gate” and confusedly looked at Old Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever, let’s enter.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Should we announce it?” instantly asked Zhuo Nong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Announce what? I’m not used to it.” Chu Mu shook his head As he spoke, he began walking along that gorgeous rug towards the incomparably imposing great palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after Chu Mu, Old Wen, and Old Han entered the palace, the younger guards beside Holy Guard Captain Zhuo Nong made a small ruckus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain Zhuo, you really do know King Chu!” the younger holy guards were extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you just hear King Chu call Captain Zhuo ‘Uncle Zhuo’?” another said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, the other holy guards couldn’t hold their patience and began discussing the god-like person they saw just now and the strongest phoenix species creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, who permitted you to speak while standing guard. As a holy guard, you should know your duty!” Zhuo Nong didn’t give anything away and rebuked those young holy guards. When holy guards were standing guard, they weren’t allowed to speak. They always had to be enveloped by soul remembrance and had to comply with rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody dared to say anything more, but those younger holy guards saw that Great Holy Guard Captain Zhuo was now wearing a smile that was hard to discern. It seemed that this old man was pleased in his heart but was pretending to keep his cool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the great palace, three people sat in the high seats. At the very center was a kingly gold. It was majestic and imposing, resembling a crouching tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the sides of the golden main seat were silver and blue high seats. The golden main seat was empty while Liu Binglan sat on the silver seat, and Prince Chao sat on the blue seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao had grown too quickly. He had shed his scholarly aura and his sword-like appearance exuded seriousness and dignity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao could be said to have matured a lot in the span of an evening. It was particularly his father’s death that had undoubtedly incited him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind the three main seats were a few other high seats. They belonged to Mu Qingyi, Bai Yu, and future-born dominators. However, today, the only person on these seats was Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below Mu Qingyi were the Nightmare Emperor, senior elders and elders of the Three Great Palaces, arranged in that order. They were Nightmare Emperor Jiang, Senior Elder Liu, Senior Elder Shen, Senior Elder Pang, Senior Elder Xiao, Elder De, Elder Mei, Elder Xiong and outstanding younglings that included Ye Wansheng, Shen Mo, Pang Yue, Teng Lang, Qin Yutong, and Xiao Hai&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a few empty seats, but most were occupied. Of course, there were a few new faces which were from the neutral factions and reclusive experts once oppressed by Soul Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people formed the high level powers of the Three Great Palaces. There were about 30 people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind these 30 people were elders, guest elders, great palace masters, apalace masters, holy guards and various large kingdom lords, city lords and vice-city lords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were about 300 of these people who all were at least spirit emperors. There were even a few lower ranked spirit emperors who didn’t have the qualifications to sit there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only a few people of these 300 people who recognized Chu Mu. When Chu Mu was a low ranked spirit emperors, he had transformed into a devil and after his cultivation as a devil, he had skipped these stages. HIs strength had greatly increased so the people of this stage that recognized him were not many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Chu Mu had skipped this stage, this didn’t mean these people didn’t exist. From the amount of people there, it could be seen that these people formed the core force of Wanxiang Realm and Tianxia Realm. Without them, the two great realms would become a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were about 400 people in the great hall. A hall being able to accommodate 400 people was a lot and when Chu Mu walked him, he still felt it was slightly empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. Leave Cloud Gate Realm’s people to us. Although we really don’t want to come here, we’ve received orders to guard this place for five years until your territory is absorbed into ours. Of course, we won’t be administering you. Our lord has ordered that we are not allowed to meddle with the development here.” the young man sitting on the guest seat was wearing a frivolous smile as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of 4 people on the guest seats and the one speaking was in the secondary seat. Liu Binglan had seen him before as he had come here once. He was the arrogant young man Ning Changqing who had taken Ning Maner away before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu has returned!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s King Chu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ning Changqing was speaking, everyone in the great palace focused on the three people slowly making their way in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Changqing’s eyes fell on these three people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu glanced at the four guests. He didn’t say anything, and walked directly to the high seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu?” at this moment, Ning Changqing’s gaze swept by Chu Mu and landed last on Old Han. He said: “You are the person known as the strongest of New Moon Land, King Chu?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Han was confused for a moment, but discovered that these four people from Dark Sky Ocean World were staring at him. He quickly understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ke ke, you’ve got it wrong.” Old Han coughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Changqing and the three others were all stunned. They had confused expressions when they suddenly found that the young man ignored by them had walked to the empty golden seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He unhurriedly sat on the most authoritative seat, and then coldly looked down on the four of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four guests all showed expressions of shock. When these three people had walked in, they subconsciously figured that the older man that looked to be more qualified was “King Chu.” They never expected King Chu was the young man they had chosen to ignore!!</span></p>
