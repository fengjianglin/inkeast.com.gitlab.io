 <p><strong>Chapter 89: Aiming for the Strongest of the Young Generation</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Jin Rou didn’t take any notice of the Jia City city master’s meaningless flattery. Her eyes still stared at Chu Mu and the mutated Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox Mo Xie. Even though she had a veil on her face, one could still see the shock she was undoubtedly experiencing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This demon fox……” Princess Jin Rou slowly recovered from her shock, yet her expression continued to shift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because she remembered that, three years ago, the soul pet on Chu Mu’s shoulders was a special Moonlight Fox. At the time, she even hugged the little fox while watching the horizon…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three years later, Chu Mu brought an Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox and powerfully rose in power within Nightmare Palace, becoming the most dazzling star of recent times in one go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet now, this Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox had, under her own eyes, mutated into an even higher species rank, the Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox Mo Xie!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three phases, all of which were of the demon fox species, and she had just personally witnessed the mutation from Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox to Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it a coincidence??” Princess Jin Rou murmured to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Chu Mu abandoned his original Moonlight Fox and chose this Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox as his new main soul pet, and then this new Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox mutated into a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, then the process was within understanding. After all, Chu Mu’s Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox had indeed displayed very outstanding talents, so the chances of a mutation was larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, if it was the other situation, where Chu Mu never abandoned that Moonlight Fox, and that Moonlight Fox had mutated into an Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox, before mutating into a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, then it would mean that Chu Mu had a soul pet that could mutate continuously!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A continuously mutating soul pet! One species mutation could almost raise a soul pet trainer to a new level. As for continuous mutation, this soul pet would shake the entire soul pet realm, especially now that it had become a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox comparable to a monarch rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwu~~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The royal flames on her suddenly started burning, and Mo Xie’s body gradually went back to her Pitiful Appearance form. Mo Xie, who had become a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, also underwent changes when in Pitiful Appearance. Her fluffy, silver fur was even more noble and nine little tails waved around as she walked. They no longer had the intimidating, crazed dragon-like manner, and when they waved in the wind, they were unbearably cute, causing people to want to cuddle and play with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuwuwu~~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was proud, cold, and full of monarch-like aggressiveness, when back in Pitiful Appearance, Mo Xie became like a wronged child who had won her honor back, as she jumped into Chu Mu’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu smiled and, not paying attention to the others’ gazes, slowly carried little Mo Xie off the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Through the entire fighting process, Chu Mu almost didn’t use any soul power. However, he still walked out of the battlefield the way he walked into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, it was completely different from before. As everyone looked at this Prison Island King, their gazes had uncontrollable shock, revere and envy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Feng was already a pinnacle top tier expert within Jia Region, and he lost. However, no one seemed to care about this fact. It wasn’t that no one cared about Jia Feng’s defeat. Even if he won, his achievement couldn’t cover up the leap from perfect warrior rank to perfect commander rank that this Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox had made- especially when this perfect commander rank had the powerful ability to be compared to a monarch rank!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So when Chu Mu slowly walked back to his seat again, who dared to let out a single sound of complaint?</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the battle ended, Chu Mu naturally had to report to Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Chu Mu’s eyes, Princess Jin Rou was forever calm and indifferent. Other than wearing a light melancholic look when watching bodies of water, her beautiful eyes were always masked with calmness and wisdom, as if nothing could cause the princess to have emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, when walking towards Princess Jin Rou, Chu Mu could clearly feel the gaze of those beautiful eyes. These eyes were very enchanting. With one sight, one would be dragged into her world, unable to free oneself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Jin Rou’s gaze no longer had the usual calmness. It had some doubt, questioning, as well as an emotion that Chu Mu couldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu had never been able to understand Princess Jin Rou’s eyes. He was only able to tell that she hid a lot in her heart…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu made a simple salute and glanced at Jin Kui, who was watching on with a strange look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, Chu guard must be tired after the big battle, bring your soul pet and go rest for now……” Princess Jin Rou kept a calm tone as she said to Chu Mu, not mentioning Chu Mu’s soul pet mutation a single time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu knew that Princess Jin Rou definitely had something to tell him, but now was not the right place, so he nodded and followed one of Princess Jin Rou’s personal servants back to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the battle is over, let us bid farewell to each other then.” The Jia City city master saw that Princess Jin Rou had no intention to stay anymore and stood up slowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, the Jia City city master saluted to Princess Jin Rou and watched as she left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heng, this woman, so young yet so calm, not asking anything under such circumstances.” Seeing the princess leave, the Jia City city master’s smile disappeared and he let out a cold “heng”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, the Jia City city master stormed off, completely disregarding Jia Feng, whose rib cage was still broken from Mo Xie’s tail sweep.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long ago, he had just beaten the Luo Region Nightmare Prince, causing him to become known by everyone within the nearby regions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, this fight, though very short and only had Chu Mu’s main soul pet fighting, had effects far stronger than before!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, tens of thousands of people witnessed Chu Mu’s Evil Flamed Six Tail Demon Fox mutate into a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie was already at the sixth phase fourth stage. This mutation meant that Chu Mu’s main soul pet was a sixth phase monarch rank!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How terrifying was a sixth phase monarch rank’s power? With this soul pet in existence, which top tier young expert still dared to challenge Chu Mu?!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An even larger craze swept through the nearby regions, spreading to even further places!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This battle caused Chu Mu to truly become the brightest new star within the regions, beating the many top tier young experts that people knew about, instantly becoming one of the strongest young experts in the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, just region wise, in places like Luo Region and Jia Region, it was nigh impossible to find an expert in the young generation to compete against Chu Mu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The only possibilities were the two large powers, the Nightmare Palace and the Luo Region Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nightmare Palace and the Luo Region Sect had numerous young experts, and it was possible that they were even hiding a few spirit master level top tier young experts. At the very least, Chu Mu had already seen one, which was Nightmare Prince Adjudicator Lu Shanli, who was a spirit master level expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, Chu Mu’s fame couldn’t compare to characters like Lu Shanli, but the mutation of his Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox into the Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox showed that Chu Mu’s power was quickly nearing that of the super youth experts from large powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the entire soul pet realm, the major powers had carefully trained countless experts. Relying on their background and influence, there’d always be some otherworldly prodigee that surpassed their age and fought everywhere, especially within the heavy hitters, like the Nightmare Palace, the Soul Pet Palace, and the Luo Region Sect, who had bases almost across the entire world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young generation soul pet trainers were in the tens of thousands, and to reach the top, how hard was it without corresponding strength?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was different about Chu Mu, compared to those already famous top tier experts, was that Chu Mu had no background, completely relying on himself to reach his current state. The shock that such an expert brought wasn’t laced with emotions of “It should’ve been like this”, only pure, raw, shock. After all, for a youth to completely rely on one’s own power to reach this height was nigh impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, many rumors about Chu Mu slowly spread throughout the cities. Some felt that Chu Mu was some super powerful expert’s low profile apprentice, while most people felt that Chu Mu completely relied on himself to reach the realm that he was in. Another small portion of people thought Chu Mu was only lucky that his Evil Flamed Six Tailed Demon Fox had mutated into the Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, or else to reach this realm would require at least a few more years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how the rumors were spread, the Prison Island King was now different from the Prison Island King that defeated Tian Ji. Becoming a true top tier young expert, when he walked into other regions, other than the true experts at the tip of the pyramid, it was probable that fellows who thought that they were the best in the region would no longer challenge Chu Mu out of nowhere!</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>While this regional shaking message spread out from Jia City, Chu Mu had returned to his resting room and had already started to think of how to shake the control of Nightmare Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu, in reality, didn’t know Princess Jin Rou’s personality that well, and his favorable impression for her was only because of her kindhearted act in the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu believed that all individuals with lots of authority were shrewd, including Princess Jin Rou, who always gave off a calm and melancholic feel. Chu Mu could be sure that the doubt in her eyes when she gazed at him meant that Princess Jin Rou, who had seen Mo Xie in her Moonlight Fox phase, had already thought of the possibility of a continuously mutating soul pet!</span></p>
