 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present had a Monument Tear so they had heard quite a bit about Monument Tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark Sect’s Heaven Slaughter was a typical Monument Tear Individual. He gained massive power from the Monument Tear and killed all the immortal rank experts surrounding him. He created the shocking Northern Territory’s incident, and became a terrifying Monument Tear Individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Guang, Zeng Long, Luo Yi, Ji Gui all guessed that Dark Sect would likely intervene. However, even with their mental preparation, they didn’t expect Dark Sect to send Heaven Slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Dark Sect members appeared, Snake Dragon Faction, Divine Sect, and Wupan Navy all suddenly seemed to become allies. They all stared at the seven dark sect people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou were surrounded by four factions. Interestingly enough, when the Dark Sect people appeared, the four factions all ignored Princess Jin Rou and his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Chu Mu didn’t think that they would just let them leave. After all, their real objective was the Monument Tear and not a life or death battle in Imprint Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill them all.” Heaven Slaughter glanced at the three factions and said a shocking statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qing Guang, Zeng Long, Luo Yi, and Ji Gui all showed anger. This Dark Sect person was really too arrogant. From their perspective, any one of them four had the power to match him, yet he was completely ignoring all of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five people behind Heaven Slaughter immediately walked out. Dark Sect people were usually fervent over dark type organisms. When these five chanted an incantation, a thick dark aura came forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, this scent was liked by Chu Mu, full of dark elements and blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, five dark type soul pet diagrams appeared. From their aura, one could tell that Dark Sect’s people were much stronger than the other three factions. No wonder Heaven Slaughter could say such rash words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect and Snake Dragon Faction naturally allied. Wupan Navy, on the other hand, didn’t seem to understand what “the enemy of an enemy is my friend” meant and remained arrogantly alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Dark Sect’s first target was Wupan Navy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wupan Navy had six people total, each with Ocean Lord title and immortal rank strength with Luo Yi and Ji Gui as head. When the five Dark Sect individuals killed their way over, the leader Luo Yi had to intervene. He knew that his subordinates couldn’t defeat the five Dark Sect members of Heaven Slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zen Long and Qing Guang glanced at each other. They were wondering whether they should help the Wupan Navy defeat the Dark Sect people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, with a deeper thought, Heaven Slaughter and the other female Dark Sect member hadn’t attacked yet, so they kept to themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heaven Slaughter, this region’s spatial support is very weak already. Telling your subordinates to attack will definitely make this region a death marsh. Do you want to die here too?” Zeng Long said angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark Sect’s five members were quite powerful. Each technique they casted caused destruction to the space. Before the fight even finished, it was likely that the space would become a massive black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long’s words seemed to have reminded Heaven Slaughter of something. Heaven Slaughter’s eyes shined brighter and he replied in a very calm voice, “That would be perfect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You maniac!!” Zeng Long’s face tattoos quivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had a death wish, he didn’t need to drag them along!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long always thought he was an evil person that dared to do anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Dark Sect people were truly mad. They had a typical behavior, which was doing things that harmed both themselves and their enemies. Even if they died with their enemies, they would view it as a great victory. Against such a person in a world that could collapse at any time was giving these madmen the perfect environment to go crazy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark Sect’s five people continued to fight the Wupan Navy. The energy explosions caused the space to shiver. One could clearly see all the places the spatial cracks reached, and that they were slowly expanding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark Sect people ignored this scene. Their main purpose was to kill the Wupan Navy. This was the command their master Heaven Slaughter gave them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Others could be let go, but Wupan Navy must die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark Sect people were very vengeful. Wupan Navy Chieftain had attacked Heaven Slaughter before. After Heaven Slaughter got away barely, the only thing Heaven Slaughter was thinking of was how to exact revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Imprint Valley incident was the perfect chance. The scared Wupan Navy Chieftain didn’t dare to enter the Imprint Valley himself, so he would just kill all his close subordinates!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large black hole constantly pushed downwards. The spatial cracks on the ground started to expand as well, creating a larger spatial blackhole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the black hole come near, Wupan Navy’s people started turning pale. They started fighting more reservedly towards Dark Sect, because they were afraid their energy would speed up the death in this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, what do we do?” Princess Jin Rou said worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space started shaking even harder. If they continued this way and waited for the crack above them to connect with the cracks underneath them, the space will become a true void of death that no one will escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu originally thought the collapse of the space would cause everyone to stop their fighting. Yet, the Dark Sect people appeared. More terrifying was that all the Dark Sect people were prepared to die along with the rest of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appearance of Dark Sect members, to a certain extent, helped Chu Mu alleviate the pressure he was feeling from the other factions. However, them wanting to die with him was a bad turn of events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leng Lou, what is wrong with your master, does he really want all of us to die?” Chu Mu used his mental voice to say to the fighting Leng Lou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, Wupan Navy people must die. Even if we all die, Heaven Slaughter wants the Wupan Navy dead. We can’t disobey it no matter what. However, all of us dying here may be an exaggeration. Master Heaven Slaughter knows the limits.” Leng Lou replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Lou saying that reminded Chu Mu of the talk between the Navy Chieftain and Sect Master Du beforehand. Sect Master Du seemed to mention that the Imprint Valley had another exit, and also mentioned that Dark Sect likely had powerful other type soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In such an environment, Other type organisms become the key. Only they could survive in the endless black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Heaven Slaughter wants to collapse this region and kill everyone. Then he’ll escape using his Other type soul pet.” Chu Mu said in a heavy voice to Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Space doesn't have a clear effect on me. I can survive a while in a black hole. How about you?” Princess Jin Rou quickly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should be fine, but I’m scared we can’t find an exit in a short amount of time.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the third layer of sky. Spatial storms were incredibly strong here. Chu Mu had no confidence that he could stay in this chaos for too long. If he couldn’t find an exit quickly, he would still die in here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It feels like Dark Sect Heaven Slaughter doesn’t have that much hostility towards you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“En, I could tell. If you can’t tell as well, we can give the Monument Tear to him.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t care about the Monument Tear as much as the other Monument Tear Individuals. After all, the power he had wasn’t from the Monument Tear. Even if he didn’t have a Monument Tear, Chu Mu wouldn’t stay stagnant within Immortal Rank territory. He still had Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew to preserve himself; Chu Mu wasn’t an overly stubborn person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s wait and see some more.” Princess Jin Rou felt that things weren’t as bad as they imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded. While the battle hadn't ended yet, Chu Mu tried to help his soul pets recover as much strength as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This madman, these madmen!!”Ji Gui said with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire space was almost shattered. It’s as if they were surrounded by an endless ocean. However, the lonely islands they were floating on were also gradually getting destroyed by these crazy men, leaving them no chance of survival!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long and Qing Guang’s expressions were becoming worse. They wanted to kill this group of Dark Sect people immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they didn’t dare to attack now. The moment they tried to, the space would just get destroyed even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zeng Long, let’s leave here!” Qing Guang finally couldn’t stay any longer. The darkness got nearer, and no one could truly remain calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long didn’t want to die here. Seeing Qing Guang bring four divine sect members to escape along a narrow pathway, he bit down and brought his subordinates away too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he left, Zeng Long gave Chu Mu an evil glare and said, “If you’re still alive, no matter where you are, I will take your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu saw him prepared to leave and found it funny. He retorted, “You can kill me right now if you want, I’ll stand here and let you kill me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think I won’t?” Zeng Long immediately was furious. This kid was too infuriating!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zeng Long, leave!” Qing Guang furrowed his brows. This time, he was the one stopping Zeng Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zeng Long turned and left but comforted himself. Chu Mu would definitely die in Dark Sect people’s hands. Even if he wasn’t dead, he would be buried alongside Imprint Valley!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Sect and Snake Dragon Faction had all left, causing Wupan Navy’s people to be shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They also wanted to leave this increasingly dangerous place. However, Dark Sect people weren’t letting them go. Ji Gui was finally getting anxious. If he didn’t intervene, all of his subordinates would die. However, if he did attack, Heaven Slaughter would definitely fight too. With both of their techniques, the space would only deteriorate faster. This was akin to speeding up his own death.</span></p>
