 <p><strong>Chapter 202: Midair Flesh Fight, Zhan Ye vs Ice Winged Tiger (1)</strong></p>
 <p><span style>The jet black hair hung down. Supple and neat. Free and majestic, and further giving one a feeling of sinister darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lion-like robust and domineering soul pet strangely appeared beside Zhang Qin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its front limbs possessed two black dagger-like bone blades. Presently, these bone blades were dyed in a few drops of fresh blood. It was also these bone blades that ripped apart the defenseless Zhang Qin’s throat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Li quickly saw the fresh blood spurt out of Zhang Qin, whose face quickly darkened and his gaze gaze rapidly shifted to the graceful figure under the plankway!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the 800 Crafty Rock Guards had appeared, Qing Li and Zhang Qin’s attentions were fully on the fight in front of them. At the start, they had considered the problem of Ye Qingzi, who had yet to appear. However, as the battle continued and became intense, they gradually forgot about Ye Qingzi who hadn’t appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Qing Li and Zhang Qin hadn’t considered was that when all the Crafty Rock Guards were killed, Ye Qingzi’s soul pet would appear. Unexpectedly with one fatal strike, she instantly killed the defenseless Zhang Qin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi rode on the Purple Robe Dream Beast, whose wounds had recovered and, with a few jumps, landed in front of Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the 800 Crafty Rock Guards had appeared, Ye Qingzi had always been under the plankway waiting for the opportune moment. It wasn’t until the battle had ended and Zhang Qin, because he was greedy for the Ghost King, finally exposed a gap that Ye Qingzi finally grasped the one hit sure kill opportunity to get rid of Zhang Qin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get rid of Zhang Qin’s three masterless soul pets and it’ll be fine.” Chu Mu said to Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once a soul pet trainer had been killed, the soul pets that had already been summoned would have animosity. Although their soul memories could have been damage, they were still dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi quickly chanted an incantation, summoning the seventh phase fifth stage Ice Fire Demon Fairy in front of her. She then summoned the mysterious soul pet back beside her and her gaze turned to wardsZhang Qin’s three incomparably angry soul pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just you two who want to contend against me? Both of you go die!!” Qing Li’s anger had already hit the limit. He controlled the Ardent King Kong Demon to charge at Chu Mu’s Ice Air Fairy, planning on getting rid of Chu Mu’s elemental soul pet, which possessed enormous destructive power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ardent King Kong Demon’s body was fully wrapped in a golden, sturdy rock like a steel-cast violent ape. As it ran, its domineering strength was incomparable and with each jump, it seemingly would make the mountain rampart cave in a bit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ning, maintain some distance!” Chu Mu naturally knew that the Ardent King Kong Demon was probably similar to the Rock Generals. It was a rock type soul pet that had a combination of strength and defense. The moment this soul pet was allowed to get close, it would be extremely hard to defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice Mirror!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation was practically completed instantaneously. Numerous incomparably glossy ice walls emerged on the mountain and some of them even floated on the broken parts of the plankway...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ardent King Kong Demon’s body was full of strength and amidst its extreme jumps, instantly shattered these successively arranged ice walls. Its two mighty arms raised high in the air and it abruptly usd the terrifying Pulverize technique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unobstructed arms struck the precipitous mountain rampart the Ice Air Fairy was at. The Ardent King Kong Demon directly passed through the illusory Ice Air Fairy and crashed into the thick mountain stone layer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Twenty meters above the Ardent King Kong Demon, the Ice Air Fairy slowly emerged from an ice mirror. It had already prepared an incantation in its mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Towering Ice- Ice Seal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold ice aura circled around the Ice Air Fairy’s body, and the bluish white frost moved along the mountain behind the Ice Air Fairy. It rapidly moved down, and soon sealed the hole that the Ardent King Kong Demon had smashed into in a layer of thick towering ice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Li’s eyebrows creased. His Ardent King Kong Demon had already expended a lot of physical energy in the fight just now, and the fighting strength it could exhibit right now wasn’t even 70% of what it could originally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s Ice Air Fairy further possessed the powerful towering ice. The ice seal’s force became incomparably sturdy and, for a short while, the Ardent King Kong Demon fundamentally could not shatter the ice layer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice Winged Tiger, shatter the ice layer!” Qing Li gave the Ice Winged Tiger an order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With its wings spread apart, the Ice Winged Tiger flew along the stone wall. It quickly flew towards the Ice Air Fairy’s location, wanting to stop its incantation, it continued to recite while also freeing the Ardent King Kong Demon from the ice seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhan Ye, don’t let your opponent run!” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou hou hou!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye immediately used Extreme Speed and its speed bursted forth. After adding speed on the half-section plankway, it unexpectedly could run along the stone wall and painted a long black shadow on the perpendicular mountain rampart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When its inertia was about to disappear, Zhan Ye abruptly jumped off the stone, its body leaping up!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Splitting Claw!!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its two claws extended, the ink claws scratching the stone wall, it ruthlessly tore at the soaring Ice Winged Tiger!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Winged Tiger’s body turned over, and its enormous wings gave an abrupt wave. Before Zhan Ye had used Heavenly Splitting Claw, its wings knocked Zhan Ye flying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye’s strength was quite inferior to the Ice Winged Tiger. After striking the Ice Winged Tiger’s wings, it was instantly swatted flying and, like a falling rock, it fell diagonally under the broken plankway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Xie!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu no longer had much soul power remaining. Although he could use Dragon Wind Ride to lift Zhan Ye, at this moment, the tacit communication between his soul pets was really put to the test by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu wu wu~~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Tail Confuse floated by and Mo Xie, who was originally fighting high above, suddenly appeared below. One of her tails quickly swept up the falling Zhan ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s tails could be hard or soft. After easing Zhan Ye’s falling force, she abruptly threw Zhan Ye back up at the Ice Winged Tiger high above!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xie’s tail strength was extremely strong. Throwing Zhan Ye like this practically made its speed reach the max, and the tenacious life force Zhan Ye never worried about the consequences. Its two black eyes were rigidly fixed on the Ice Winged Tiger as it used Heavenly Splitting Claw again!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shua!!! Shua!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, this Ice Winged Tiger wasn’t able to dodge in time. The two interweaving claw tips streaked across its body, forming crisscrossing wounds. Fresh blood began to rapidly seep out of its body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou hou!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Winged Tiger soaring in the air let out a painful howl. Its two yellow eyes unexpectedly turned red as its blood continued to flow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Violent Blood Pupil!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The incantation was finally finished, and a blood red armor slowly enveloped the Ice Winged Tiger’s body, dying its body completely in red. Its two eyes also transformed into a bloodthirsty color!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou hou hou hou!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violent Blood Beast was innately able to allow a soul pet to forget pain. The blood colored battle gear, after it was draped on, caused the Ice Winged Tiger’s beast aura to terrifyingly discharge. It became incomparably malevolent and instantaneously, it locked onto Zhan Ye which was hanging on the cliff’s stone wall using its claws. Abruptly, it beat its wings and flew at Zhan Ye! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Water Screen Armor!” Ye Qingzi knew that Chu Mu’s Zhan Ye needed special consideration, and she added the soul technique on its body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye had already reached the sixth phase ninth stage and its defense had increased a lot. After the Towering Ice armor disappeared, its defense was still able to reach the late seventh stage. After Ye Qingzi’s Water Screen Armor was added, its defense increased to the pseudo eighth stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Towering Ice armor’s effects were better, but it was quite a bit of obstruction towards Zhan Ye’s movements. Using Water Screen Armor on Zhan Ye was even more beneficial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye didn’t have the ability to fly and furthermore, this mountain rampart didn’t have a place to put its feet. It could only use its claws to deig into the mountain, hanging onto the rock wall. Seeing the Ice Winged Tiger flying at it with torrential imposition, Zhan Ye resolutely relaxed its claw, and its body directly slid down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Winged Tiger rose from the seventh phase second stage to the seventh phase fourth stage. Violent Blood Pupils’ effects allowed the Ice Winged Tiger to be full of an even more bloody aura. Seeing Zhan Ye drop down, it drew up a fiendish blood wind and dove down diagonally!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dropping Zhan Ye smashed firmly into a protruding rock. Using this buffer, Zhan Ye abruptly turned around and leapt into the air, landing in a rock crevice under the plankway!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shattering Claw!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How terrifying was the Ice Tiger Wing’s diving force? Like a blood colored hurricane, it dove with extreme speed. Shattering Claw’s force exploded on the rock crevice where Zhan Ye was resting!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous clustered fissures appeared on the mountain rampart. As the Shattering Claw sank in, the entire stone wall suddenly shattered, unexpectedly blowing up a large ten meter perimeter hole which depth was two to three meters!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of strength was it to be able to break through two to three meters of mountain rock?! With Zhan Ye’s defense, albeit having reached the pseudo eighth stage, its ink armor was still ruptured, exposing flesh and bones full of fresh blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu was able to sense Zhan Ye’s fight through the mental connection. Qing Li’s Ice Winged Tiger had clearly undergone tens of millions of gold of strengthening. Otherwise, even with Violent Blood Pupils’ effects, it wouldn’t be able to deal such terrifying destruction force with its seventh phase fourth stage strength!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, my Ice Winged Tiger’s beast attribute has already reached the peak commander realm. Your sixth phase ninth stage Mo Ye, even if its strength slowly increases in a fight, cannot compare with my Ice Winged Tiger!” sneered Qing Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Winged Tiger’s attack had instantly given Zhan Ye serious wounds. In Qing Li’s opinion, this soul pet would definitely die. As long as he got rid of one of Chu Mu’s soul pets and in the next fights while Zhang Qin’s three soul pets delayed Ye Qingzi, he was still confident that he could get rid of them both!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu indifferently raised the corners of his lips and coldly read out Zhan Ye’s technique name: “Broken Limb Rebirth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou Hou!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tenacious life force of Zhan Ye made it so that it could not be so easily killed. After angrily roaring, the wounds on Zhan Ye rapidly seeped out insect fluid which wrapped around its body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sixth Broken Limb Rebirth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan Ye had followed Chu Mu for such a long period of time, yet this was the first time he had used the sixth Broken Limb Rebirth. It was also his last Broken Limb Rebirth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of its shattered tiger bones, the messed up flesh in its body or the extremely smashed armor, after a short few seconds of the insect fluid smearing past, Zhan Ye was completely fine like the start. A new ink colored armor flashed the newest lustre!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Chu Mu read out the technique’s name, Qing Li astonishedly looked down. He wasn’t able to react in time when a noise suddenly rang out of the shattered cave. Subsequently afterward, a beast figure with wings was knocked flying out of the shattered cave. The one that flew out a dozen meters happened to be Qing Li’s Ice Winged Tiger!!</span></p>
