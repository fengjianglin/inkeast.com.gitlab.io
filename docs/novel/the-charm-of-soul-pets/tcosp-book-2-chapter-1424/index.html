 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space trembled violently. This world was already in the state of collapse. Once the spatial support was broken, that patch of space would be immediately destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the chaotic spatial fragments, chaos energy continuously blasted down like a streak of lightning, madly hitting the wind type snake dragon without any warning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet trainer on top of it was unable to react at all and his green Wind Snake Dragon was instantly bisected!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ten people from Snake Dragon Faction were taken aback. If that chaos lightning strike was shifted slightly, then it would have been them who might have died!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Move! You don’t want to live anymore?” roared Zeng Long furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Zeng Long rode his golden snake dragon seriously and rapidly retreated to the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden snake dragon was the strongest amongst them, but Zeng Long did not presume that his golden snake dragon could resist against the terrifying destructive force that was generated by the spatial crack and the collapse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other nine Snake Dragon Faction members finally reacted and they also hurriedly rode their soul pets to escape from there!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the area that was affected by the spatial collapse was vast. The second chaos strike was shot horizontally into the group. The six members at the front were able to escape in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, three of their members were intercepted and a huge spatial crack was formed in between them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wanying!” A man who was riding on a Fire Snake Dragon saw his teammate getting separated and wanted to save her by bypassing the space crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enforcer She shouted angrily, “Guang Ping, do you want to commit suicide? Can you still return if you were to go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man called Guang Ping was startled for a moment. He looked past the terrifying spatial crack and saw that the space in that region was already falling off piece by piece. That scene was like a piece of the sky was falling off and the earth was dropping into a bottomless abyss, causing one’s head to go numb for a moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a moment of hesitation, Guang Ping decided to give up on charging back......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pzzt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a crack that was spreading out from the collapsed space zoomed past and went right through the body of a four winged snake dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That four winged snake dragon was unable to react at all as the crack had spread in the direction of its long body. This had caused the four winged snake dragon that was over two hundred meters long to instantly disappear into the terrifying spatial crack, leaving only a lifeless head behind......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guang Ping and Enforcer She were left shocked once again. If that crack had spread out horizontally, then the both of them would have been bisected!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guang Ping no longer had room to think about those other trapped teammates. He urged his own Fire Snake Dragon to escape as far away as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Snake Dragon Faction members who were separated by the spatial crack were not dead yet. They were still desperately struggling to find an opening which would allow them to escape from this cracking space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as the space was collapsing faster and faster, those deadly spatial cracks and the chaos lightning strikes were very dense now. Those phenomena without any signs would easily shred them and their soul pets into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chunks of corpses were falling into the chaotic region, eventually getting swept away by the death swirl into some unknown place. A death this terrifying would probably not leave even a fragment of soul behind......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, Princess Jin Rou watched the horrifying scene in utter astonishment. She was rendered speechless for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had also never imagined that the spatial collapse would create such a terrifying burial effect. Immortal rank creatures were truly so insignificant before this kind of regional collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the entire Imprint Valley collapsed, then what kind of disastrous scene would it be like?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could not imagine that at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s leave as well,” Princess Jin Rou was scared of the scene before her eyes. Recalling that this Imprint Valley would be collapsing just like that very soon as well, she began to panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu did not intend to stay in this place for long. He was fairly knowledgeable about spatial structure. In space, there existed some important and fragile support nodes. Once those nodes were destroyed, the unstable space would also rapidly collapse. This collapsed space would constantly spread out as if a hole was opened up in a dam that was not really solid. This hole would keep spreading wider and wider over time due to the water pressure......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s act had successfully harmed and deterred the advance of the Snake Dragon Faction, but it was also extremely dangerous at the same time because he had sped up the destruction of this region in the Imprint Valley. If they could not leave the Imprint Valley within a short time, then they would also be buried here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This place feels a lot better, I hate light after all,” a masked woman took off her mask as she said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman had white and supple skin. The moment she took off her mask, the other masked members who were exuding a chilling aura looked towards her unconsciously. Each of them had gotten bewitched by her beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a sexy woman who possessed beauty, wildness and elegance simultaneously. The black tight suit she wore was unable to hide her alluring proportions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people that were standing around that woman were all cold-blooded and bloodthirsty existences. However, even though they seemed to be lusting after the woman, they still remained extremely respectful, afraid of offending that woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Miss Si, just leave this kind of matter to us. We will definitely complete the mission,” assured the masked Leng Lou respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you know that I love to see desperate fights?” Miss Si smiled flirtatiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leng Lou no longer dared to say anything in return and stepped back after lowering his head once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miss Si did not mind Leng Lou anymore and took secret glances at another robust figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding men would always look at her with a gaze as if possessed. Miss Si never thought that it was offensive, in contrast, she felt that it was the proof of her charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, only one man seemed indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">True indifference did not need any form of disguise. Miss Si could tell from the gaze whether a man was really interested in her or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This powerful man called Tian Lu who was clearly the perpetrator of the mass murder event in the Northen land belonged to the type of people that showed indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not the first time that Miss Si had interacted with Tian Lu. It could even be said that Miss Si had been watching that man slowly changing through competition, killing and conspiracies, and eventually reaching his current position and strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that a leader made a move on you?” asked Miss Si after walking next to Tian Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Tian Lu wore a mask on his face and only revealed a pair of sharp and cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is your soul alright?” asked Miss Si.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew very well how strong leader level existences were. Once people like them offend a leader level existence, there was almost no chance of survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, he’s too arrogant,” replied Tian Lu flatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling the situation of that day, Tian Lu’s gaze finally showed some change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time that he had encountered such a powerful opponent since the day he became a soul pet trainer.That opponent was so strong that he felt that he would not be able to surpass them no matter how long he trained. It made any power feel insignificant before that opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wupan Chief. This was a powerful leader that made countless people both fear and respect them. Only by reaching such a level could one truly grasp the world in their palms. Authority, factions and resources were only add-ons to them in the end. They were a group of people who had already reached the peak in strength, and were seeking true immortality!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, such people usually were really arrogant. Tian Lu had made use of that trait to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being able to escape from a leader level person was enough to leave countless Immortal rank experts astonished. Tian Lu should be glad about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was not really a passive type of person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the other party had wanted to kill him, he would also not let that leader have a good time. He had entered the Imprint Valley this time not only for the Monument Tears that were possessed by others, but it was also to take the head of the subordinate that leader had sent. He could not kill Wupan Navy Chief, but it should not be a problem for him to kill his subordinate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rest assured, I will ask my father to take revenge for you,” stated Miss Si in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it necessary?” asked Tian Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is, you were almost killed by him!” A trace of anger flashed across Miss Si’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Lu did not say anything anymore. He would settle his own business himself, there was no need to alert the huge figure of the Darkness World. Also he did not want to owe any favors to this woman who held a rather special identity in Darkness Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whooooo~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raging wind swept past. A completely black creature suddenly descended from the sky and landed right next to Miss Su and Tian Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A masked man jumped down from the back of that creature. He half knelt and respectfully reported to Tian Lu “Lord Divine Sect’s Qin Guang Wupan Navy’s Jigui are already close to the youth who has obtained the Monument Tear. Should we make our move now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not yet, what about Snake Dragon Faction and Fire Sect?” questioned Tian Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fire Sect has already been defeated. Snake Dragon Sect seems to have also fallen for a trap and has lost many members,” reported that Darkness Sect scout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miss Si raised her brows and spoke with a little interest, “That youth seems quite capable. Madam Hou and Zeng Long are not weak people, to be able to repel them...... Why haven’t I heard of such a person before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have you found out who that person is?” asked Tian Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, there is a powerful Martial Cloud Dragon next to that person. So, I cannot keep up with their speed,” answered the Darkness Sect scout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know which sect or faction he belongs to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no record. It seems that he is a soul pet trainer who had broken into the Imprint Valley by himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Lu nodded and waved his hand to signal the scout to continue scouting for intel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you intend to do?” asked Miss Si.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let them fight one another for a while longer,” replied Tian Lu plainly.</span></p>
