 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s very amazing. There’s a chance you aren’t his opponent.” Shen Yue felt that it was best that Shen Mo take action to be safe. This way, he would be able to teach him a lesson not to harass her anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we’re both at the middle class emperor rank and it’s single control, there shouldn’t be a problem.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Emperor rank fights are normally single control.” added Shen Yue as she glanced inquisitively at Shen Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mo nodded his head, indicating that he could fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since that’s the case, would Young Master Chu like to set a time, or would Young Master Chu like to compare notes now?” asked Shen Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about now.” Chu Mu was a bit restless, and being able to train was naturally the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, I’ll inform your opponent now. Additionally, our arena has a few rules for spirit emperors; namely that neither side can divulge their name and true identity.” said Shen Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arena focused on comparing notes, and when one reached the spirit emperor rank, more people were concerned about their prestige and status. If they lost in this fight and this news spread, this would damage their reputation. Therefore, if both sides hid their identities, this would better satisfy the spirit emperors who only wanted to compare notes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was tacitly agreed then to keep each person’s identity a secret. If both sides didn’t mind divulging their identity, the arena wouldn’t stop them. After all, it was possible to recognize a few spirit emperors that often came through their soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t care about divulging his identity. But since it was an arena regulation, he had to abide by it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner enjoyed the liveliness and for a moment, couldn’t sit still. The gloominess and fear from before had vanished like smoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu sat in the arena hall, and was casually chatting. Yet, it wasn’t long before Shen Yue returned with a frosty expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you return so quickly?” Shen Mo glanced with curiosity at Shen Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Shen Yue went to have others inform that young man, wasn’t this a bit too quick?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fellow just arrived!” Shen Yue grit her teeth as she had a look of loathing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Mmo laughed. It seemed that that brat had truly harassed her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master Chu, I’ve already informed him, and he has accepted your challenge. The location will be in the city’s northern sand arena. The time will be in the afternoon at around sunset.” Shen Yue said to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.” Chu Mu nodded his head. Sunset began at about three in the afternoon. He could stroll around the food streets with Ning Maner before making their way over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I don’t believe that I won’t be able to get you before I leave Soul City!” on the streets, a young man full of confidence leisurely walked around, his eyes occasionally darting over the women who walked past him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, the women in Soul City are truly lustrous.” his eyes fell on a woman dressed in a dress in front of him and he silently praised her. When she walked, her butt was so round!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng had a daily routine where he would first come to flirt with Shen Yue from the arena.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as he had arrived there, Shen Yue had arranged an opponent for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng was going crazy from being bored in Soul City. Ye Qingzi was stuck in her soul techniques, and was preparing for the upcoming soul technique fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng had already fought with people in the arena, and now that another fellow who wasn’t afraid of death had finally come, this made him very happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the four years, Ye Wansheng truly could be described as having his reputation soar. In terms of strength, he didn’t have any huge obstacles in his path and he obtained numerous fortuitous encounters, causing his speed to rise so quickly even he didn’t dare to believe it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, even disregarding the young generation, in the entirety of Wanxiang Realm, those that could pose a threat to him were the experts at the Thirty Two Scars level from Soul Alliance or stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were numerous experts in Soul City, and Ye Wansheng didn’t dare be too ostentatious. Each time he fought in the arena, he had to keep his identity hidden. After all, this place was under the administration of his great enemy. If he were to expose himself, he would be met with huge trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was still early so Ye wansheng returned to his rented residence. He saw Ye Qingzi standing in the courtyard, even though she seldom did.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be you came out to enjoy the sun because you succeeded?” asked Ye Wansheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m still lacking a bit.” calmly replied Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng wanted to say a few more things, but had discovered that in the past few days, communicating with his sister had been abnormally hard. He tried to find a topic as he said: “In the afternoon I’ll be going to the city’s northern arena. There’s a fellow who isn’t afraid of death who is challenging me. Why don’t you come over too. You seem so gloomy and depressed…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Ye Wansheng was ruminating over his opponent was because he thought that this person was very likely a person Shen Yue invited to deal with him. But Ye Wansheng wasn’t afraid. In terms of strength, he didn’t believe that the person Shen Yue invited would be his opponent.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t go.” Ye Qingzi shook her head and wasn’t the least bit interested in his fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok ok. Just remember, you aren’t allowed to recklessly use soul teacher techniques.” Ye Wansheng couldn’t do anything about her so he gave her another warning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi couldn’t be bothered to respond to him. Standing under the sunlight, she watched the shadow of the wall as if she had lost focus and was thinking about something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wansheng was helpless and returned to his room to silently cultivate for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun began to set and a deep yellow color shined over the entire city filled with spirit energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the northern side of the city was originally a place where plants abundantly grew. However, where the terrain became flat, there was abruptly a battlefield in between the two inseparably close mountains. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground of this battlefield had been modified by rock type soul pets and was stronger than normal ground by 100 times. It was able to barely withstand the wrecking of an emperor rank creature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the time, Chu Mu came as they had agreed. Next to him was the excited beautiful young girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For safety reasons, Chu Mu had brought Nightmare 1. At least when he fought, Ning Maner wouldn’t have anyone protecting her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battlefield was mainly empty as the owner of the arena didn’t wish to construct any gaudy items on the battlefield. The only items there were disposable, as there was a chance they could be completely destroyed by a single battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he stepped on the battlefield full of sand, Chu Mu saw a tiny black dot of a person in the distance. This probably was his opponent. He also wore a mask that didn’t divulge his identity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t many people spectating. This fight wasn’t public and normally only people who were well acquainted would come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This spacious battlefield was filled with towering rocks and flat stages. These flat stages reached a thousand meters high and were used by spectators to watch. However, these stages weren’t safe as they were easily destroyed by middle class emperors. The best way to watch the fight was to bring a wing type soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Chu Mu brought Ning Maner to the enormous stage, he returned to the sandy battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Chu Mu’s opponent was very close. He could see that his opponent was probably also a young man whose hair had probably been combed. In the wind, it fluttered very freely. His clothing was rather special and when he didn’t speak, he looked like an elegant young master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Lady Shen, if I win this fight, you’ll agree to become by woman?” suddenly, this masked man let out a muffled voice, unexpectedly immediately flirting with Shen Yue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing on the stone platform and looking at this shameless fellow, Shen Yue’s face went dark. She then pulled her brother’s sleeve and angrily said: “Brother, look. Was I exaggerating?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Shen Mo’s expression was stiff. Unexpectedly someone was flirting with his sister in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Either this brat was tired of living or was tired of living!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu stood there, his expression unchanging. Only, having reached this level of strength and still using these ghetto methods of picking up girls, wasn’t this too wanton? Regardless, Shen Yue was probably a woman from Nightmare Palace with extremely high status.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu, there’s no problem, right?” Shen Mo, at this moment, used a mental voice to speak to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yup.” Chu Mu didn’t need him to explain and already understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, then I’ll thank you first. It really isn’t convenient for me to take action.” laughed Shen Mo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Shen Yue’s brother, Shen Mo obviously wanted him to make it difficult for this brat. Chu Mu clearly understood this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Before the fight, I’ll mention the rules again. First, one cannot harm each other’s lives. Secondly, please try not to leave the sand battlefield so as to not affect the stability of the city. Third, both sides can only single control to fight…” the referee’s voice rang out onto the sandy battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The referee was an old man about fifty. He looked to also be a spirit emperor that was responsible for refereeing pointer swapping between spirit emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let the fight begin. Both sides summon your soul pets.” said the referee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a fair fight, both sides had to simultaneously summon soul pets so as to prevent targeted summoning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t hesitate. He immediately chanted an incantation, summoning the middle class emperor rank Ghost King. This was the most suitable place for the Ghost King to put on a display.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost King was filled with a dense ghost aura. When it was summoned on the sand battlefield, it caused the sand to abnormally tremble!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nong!!!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost King waved its sword, standing imposingly on the spacious sand battlefield. The several kilometers of continuous sand under its feet seemed to listen to its orders and could at any point transform into its weapon or defense!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It truly is a middle class emperor… brother, why have I never heard of such an outstanding person before?” Shen Yue glanced at the middle class emperor rank Ghost King and sighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve only recognized him briefly.” as he spoke, Shen Mo turned and looked at the spectating Jian Qin. He wanted to know about him from Jian Qin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jian Qin could not say that this fellow was Tianxia Realm’s King, thus she shook her head, and said that she only had a few encounters with this man before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qin Qin, could he be the person in your heart… so you’re not willing to tell us more?” Shen Yue intentionally teased Jian Qin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jian Qin’s cheeks went red and she shook her head: “You don’t know what you’re talking about. In my opinion, that person is the person in your heart…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is that possible? He’s so shameless!” Shen Yue rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two women teased each other while the older man, Shen Mo, sat to the side with his mouth open, looking helpless. Thus, he focused on the fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
