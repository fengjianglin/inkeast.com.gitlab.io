 <p>Chapter 1163: Spectral Princess (1)</p>
 <p>The spectral state devil soul disappeared!</p>
 <p>The terrifying mental tsunami flew through and twenty or so pseudo dominator ranks’ minds disappeared into smithereens, leaving only twenty corpses behind. The dominator ranks who lived in this area were all in shock!</p>
 <p>The remaining twenty or so dark brown hunters no longer had the courage to continue the search. They all stood in place, watching their companions spit blood as they crumpled to the ground. The feeling of nearly dying wasn’t so easy to get rid of!</p>
 <p>Lin Li and Wan Meng’s angry roars came from far away. They summoned the dark brown hunters to find the dominator rank devil soul.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Listen, capturing the devil soul and cooperating with you is our mission, but don’t act like you’re our master and yell!” The leader looked coldly at the two merchants and said with his mental voice.</p>
 <p>The leader’s current mood was at a low. After all, the dead twenty or so dark brown hunters were all trained by him. Just seeing them die like that was like having his heart cut open. Yet, at this time, the two greedy merchants started yelling with a sharp voice!</p>
 <p>Wan Meng and Lin Li's face turned darker. Their tone didn’t dare to command again.</p>
 <p>However, Wan Meng’s reactions were much faster. He quickly spoke and said, “Leader Yan, first call your subordinates down and we can go get my mental medicine……”</p>
 <p>“No need, they’re all dead. The light net is still there, and the devil soul has fought its dying breath while weak. Its situation was very poor. We will try to find it quickly.” Leader Yan said.</p>
 <p>“Then thank you, thank you.” Wan Meng said in poor disguise.</p>
 <p>Leader Yan knew they were being extremely fake, but the Tasks Divine Sect gave them had to be completed.</p>
 <p>“The devil soul was heavily wounded and couldn't have escaped far, continue the search, don’t let go of a single hiding place!” Leader Yan said coldly to his subordinates.</p>
 <p>“Leader, that…….then how about them?” A young member said with lingering fear as he looked at a corpse nearby.</p>
 <p>“Without anyone finishing the mission, no one can have time to mourn!” Leader Yan said.</p>
 <p>The others didn’t dare to speak and swiftly spread out, starting to use their rings to slowly search the premise.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Chu Mu stood in place and stared at where the emperor rank devil soul shattered.</p>
 <p>The emperor rank devil soul was the one in Bai Yu’s soul capture space. He already released this devil soul, but no one expected it to dash so recklessly into the mental demon diagram and get crushed. This was indeed a heart wrenching and shocking scene…...</p>
 <p>“Ning~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingzi’s little devil soul let out a little girl-like cry. The big devil soul was its brother. To protect it, the big devil soul already used itself as bait to let little devil soul escape.</p>
 <p>Yet this time, the big devil soul made another sacrifice, and ultimately didn’t even have a corpse before disappearing into thin air.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingzi wanted to hug the little devil soul, but Ye Qingzi couldn’t touch it, so she could only crouch beside it and speak some comforting words.</p>
 <p>Little devil soul’s crying caused them all to feel slightly bad. No matter what, they had played a part in this tragedy.</p>
 <p>“Wuwuwuwu~~~~~”</p>
 <p>At this time, the little Mo Xie put her mouth near Chu Mu’s ear and let out a quiet call, watching Xiao Residence.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu paused and said, “You mean the devil soul escaped into the Xiao Residence?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yu, Mu Qingyi Ye Qingzi, and the rest all were shocked. At this time, little Mo Xie stepped off of Chu Mu’s shoulder and waved its nine fuzzy tails into Xiao Residence, as if to lead the way.</p>
 <p>Everyone quickly followed up.</p>
 <p>Before, it was Mo Xie that detected the devil soul was near them. Mo Xie shouldn’t be wrong.</p>
 <p>Her silver noble figure darted through the complicated walkways and quickly reached a white underground structure.</p>
 <p>The four of them that followed showed even more shock because little Mo Xie brought them right to the ice room!</p>
 <p>“Wuwuwu~~~”</p>
 <p>Little Mo Xie turned around, and called once, before easily opening the thick gate to lead the path down the stairs and into the cold ice chamber.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu and the rest all followed, quickly running into the ice chamber.</p>
 <p>They didn’t expect that the devil soul hid here. There were many places in the city probably more suitable to hide in.</p>
 <p>The four of them entered the ice chamber. Other than ice crystals and cold air, there dind’t seem to be much else, nor was there any sign of the dominator rank Devil Soul.</p>
 <p>However, by little Mo Xie’s behavior, they knew the dominator rank devil soul was hiding in there. Her sharp eyes were sweeping the surroundings keenly.</p>
 <p>No one spoke as all their eyes gathered onto little Mo Xie. Little Mo Xie would walk around to a few different positions, especially places where the ice crystal showed reflections.</p>
 <p>After a while, little Mo Xie didn't seem to find anything and could only jump back onto Chu Mu’s shoulder, letting out a dissatisfied gruntle.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu rubbed her ears and said to the others, “Mo Xie thinks its in the ice room but can’t find where it is.”</p>
 <p>Chu Mu finished speaking and waited for everyone’s opinions. However, to his surprise, none of the other three were looking at him, instead staring through him to the other side in shock!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu turned around and the first thing that came into his vision was a silently sleeping beauty, but there was no sign of the devil soul.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu looked at the others in confusion and asked, “What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Do….. do you not see Princess Jinrou, she’s…..” Ye Qingzi pointed at her and said with a very very low voice.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu again turned around to gaze at Princess Jinrou.</p>
 <p>Princess Jinrou was still laying there motionless, her bleakly beautiful body always causing a strange pang of heartache in Chu Mu.</p>
 <p>Her hands were folded over her chest, the robe outlining her elegant figure. Her white neck was like that of a pure swan…..</p>
 <p>Her hair seems to be longer now. Chu Mu remembered that the last time he saw her, her hair was down to her back, yet now it wasto her thighs.</p>
 <p>All of this wasn't much different from what chu Mu saw previously. However, what caused him to be speechless was that her black hair seemed to be changing, becoming half-transparent white threads!</p>
 <p>The whiteness floated upwards, causing the already beautiful Princess Jinrou to look like a true angel born from the snow!</p>
 <p>“This….this…..” Chu Mu stared.</p>
 <p>This hair was very similar to a devil soul’s hair. Why was Princess Jinrou showing signs of the devil soul, can it be…...</p>
 <p>None of the four could peel their eyes away from Princess Jinrou because they finally knew where the devil soul was hiding!</p>
 <p>“Old Li….. Old Li…. what’s happening?” Chu Mu said to the late arriver Old Li.</p>
 <p>Old Li stared wide-eyed, also staring in disbelief at Princess Jinrou.</p>
 <p>The hairs remained floating. Old Li looked at the scene for a while before finally saying something, “The devil soul is currently adhered to the little princess.”</p>
 <p>Anyone could tell that the dominator rank devil soul was attached to the Princess Jinrou.</p>
 <p>The real question was, why did the heavily wounded dominator rank devil soul adhere to Princess Jinrou’s body? Princess Jinrou wasn’t much different from the dead right now.</p>
 <p>As they were all confused, the blue light blossomed and caused the place to look dreamy.</p>
 <p>This glow was all too familiar to any soul pet trainer; it was the glow of a soul pact!</p>
 <p>The glow was contained within little princess’s surroundings and slowly made a special symbol that fell onto the little princess’s forehead. Chu Mu and the others knew very well that this mark would sink through her skin and finally imprint itself on their soul. It was the mark of an undying bond between soul pet trainer and soul pet!!</p>
 <p>“Soul pact, this dominator rank devil soul is signing a soul pact with the little princess!” Seeing this, Old Li couldn’t help but yelp!!</p>
 <p>The heavily wounded dominator rank devil soul and the nearly dead little princess signing a pact, this scene caused them all to be too shocked to speak!</p>
 <p>The ice room was so quiet they could hear each other's breathing. They all stared unmovingly at Princess Jinrou.</p>
 <p>When the soul imprint finally fell on Princess Jinrou’s body, the glow around her disappeared and this was when everyone noticed Princess Jinrou’s eyelashes quiver.</p>
 <p>Was she opening her eyes??</p>
 <p>This caused all their hearts to lift in suspense. Bai Yu especially was affected. He could no longer control his emotions because he could feel that his daughter was being awakened!</p>
 <p>Her eyelashes quivered and her eyes slowly opened. However, for some unknown reason, when Princess Jinrou opened her eyes, they could simultaneously see her eyes closed.</p>
 <p>This was when she sat upright!</p>
 <p>Princess Jinrou slowly propped her soft body up. However, what shocked Bai Yu, Chu Mu, and all the others was they could see through her half-transparent body that Princess Jinrou was still laying on the ice bed.</p>
 <p>Specter!!</p>
 <p>The one that propped itself up wasn’t the revived Princess Jinrou but a specter that looked just like her!!</p>
