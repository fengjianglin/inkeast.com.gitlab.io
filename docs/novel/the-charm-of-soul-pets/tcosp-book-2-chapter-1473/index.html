 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to Ice City, it looked as if the city had just experienced a crazy battle. Everywhere he looked was tattered and some of the soul pet trainers on night duty were busy repairing the city wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corpses of those monsters were stacked up into a hill outside the inner city. The pile was really high and was exuding a really dense stench. People within Ice City did not dare to go and clean up outside the city. In the end they could only control special plants and convert those corpses into nutrients for their plant type soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of digestion process was actually really slow. The corpses could not be completely cleaned up even after daybreak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu entered the city and immediately saw that City Lord Bing Li was personally taking command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman had not been able to rest for many days now. Her face was filled with fatigue, and her feeble appearance seemed as if a strong gust could easily end up toppling her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">City Lord Bing Li noticed that a streak of dark light was entering the city. Once she saw that it was Chu Mu, she revealed a prudent smile on her face and approached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu,” City Lord Bing Li bent over a little and greeted Chu Mu respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How’s the current state of the city?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s temporarily stable. The iceberg monsters have retreated for now. There shouldn’t be a large scale assault from them within the next two to three days,” answered Bing Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Chu Mu’s Ghost King and Devil Tree Battle Solder defending the stronghold, those iceberg creatures could hardly breach their near perfect defense. City Lord Bing Li had truly witnessed the strength of the Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does King Chu have any discovery on his end?” asked Bing Li as she knew that Chu Mu had gone deep into the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The situation is very dire. There is an iceberg monster army dozens of times stronger than the one here. There’s also an Immortal rank Extreme Sky Ice Beast among them. We may have to give up on this city,” said Chu Mu directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give up?” Bing Li was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had grown up in this city since young. She had taken over the role of City Lord from her father after she had become stronger. She held special feelings towards this city. Asking her to give up this city was practically the same as separating her from her family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could tell that Bing Li was really unwilling and spoke again, “After this matter is properly settled, I will send people to help you rebuild the Ice City. The average rank of the monsters within the glacier mountain is very high. This city’s defenses cannot stop their all out assault.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How powerful are they?” asked Bing Li out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There should be over a thousand Dominator rank, around ten Immortal rank, and then the strongest Glacier Ruler leading them,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bing Li opened her mouth, but no words came out at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only around a maximum of forty Dominator rank experts in the entire Ice City right now. This was already the full strength of the city. To think that there were over a thousand Dominator rank creatures wandering around within the Glacier. If those Dominator rank creatures were to swarm towards them, then a tiny city like Ice City could not survive their stampede at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how much Bing Li loved this city, she had to also consider the lives of those citizens who lived here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are so many people in the city right now, how does King Chu intend to migrate them out of here?” asked Bing Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have already called over a large number of experts from Tianxia City, Snow City and Xiang Rong City. The New Moon Navy is also rushing towards this place as we speak. They will be in charge of transferring the people. Citizens from Ice City will be temporarily under the care of Snow City,” explained Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about those monsters?” After finding out that there were over a thousand Dominator rank creatures lurking deep inside the mountain, she felt even more anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will clean them all up,” replied Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had always been training himself through battles. It would be difficult for them to resolve this disaster without Chu Mu personally participating in it. It was also a perfect opportunity for him to receive good training. After all, apart from the time when he was in Imprint Valley, it was really difficult for him to find a place with such a large scale Dominator rank army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Chu Mu also knew that it was difficult for him to completely finish off such a large number of iceberg monsters all by himself. It was necessary to let the New Moon Navy sortie too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">New Moon Navy was not only proficient in naval warfare, the glacier warfare was also their expertise. With the New Moon Navy around, it would be easier for Chu Mu to clean them all up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Considering his property being suppressed by Extreme Sky Ice Beast, he had intended to ask Martial Cloud Dragon for help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Martial Cloud Dragon was also a battle maniac just like him. Recently, it had been living peacefully in Wanxiang City, but it would need to exercise a little occasionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu informed Mu Qingyi of his plans and immediately headed towards Wanxiang City to make a request to Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It did not take him a long time to go from Ice City to Wanxiang City. Seeing that it was already late into the night when he reached, he did not want to disturb Martial Cloud Dragon and decided to return to his own residence to take a rest himself. He would set off again after recovering some of his stamina.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after Chu Mu entered his room, he heard delightful giggles from two girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister, don’t you think that big brother is a little dumb?” Ning Maner’s crispy voice could be heard clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Him? He’s not really dumb, he just knows how to pretend to be dumb,” replied Ye Qingzi with a confident tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is he pretending to be dumb?” asked Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If he doesn’t pretend to be dumb, then there will be many dumb girls like you who will end up liking him,” teased Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When did I ever like him? He always makes such a stern face. He also often scolded me in the past and wouldn’t play with me. He even calls me a lass all the time! Big sister, help me buy some pretty and revealing clothes some day. Big brother will definitely peek at me secretly then......” said Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You little, what are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just testing big brother’s faithfulness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that how you plan to test him? If you present yourself before him like that, then be careful because he will really eat you one day. Don’t complain to me then, I can’t stop him if that happens,” said Ye Qingzi half jokingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could feel cold sweat dripping down his forehead after he heard that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What the heck are these two women talking about?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Ning Maner had been revealing her original mischievous personality more and more recently. However. she was indeed quite a beauty now, even Chu Mu did not dare to become overly intimate when interacting with her. Now she was even discussing with Ye Qingzi on how to seduce him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s words had left Chu Mu speechless, it somehow made him feel as if she was giving him free reign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Chu Mu knew that was only a private joking conversation between Ye Qingzi and Ning Maner, he could not take it seriously after all. Furthermore, when those two women were together, they would turn into little devils and Chu Mu would always suffer plenty from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu pushed open the door and slowly entered the room, pretending not to have any idea about their previous conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re back?” Ye Qingzi popped her head out from the thin blanket and softly spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thin blanket covered her body snugly. She should be lying sideways as her beautiful curve could be traced out by the blanket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm? You’re still chatting at this hour?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How does big brother know that I’m here? I even held my breath,” Ning Maner also popped her head out from under the blanket and revealed her adorable face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go back to your own room,” Chu Mu told Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Ning Maner was resolute. She held onto Ye Qingzi tightly and seemed determined to stay the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will be leaving tomorrow morning, so you can sleep with your big sister tomorrow,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, there are many rooms free in the house, big brother can just pick one of them to sleep,” Ning Maner stuck to Ye Qingzi and refused to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s expression darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This little girl can be just so annoying at times. Don’t you know that Ye Qingzi and I are a married couple? Why are you always coming here to disrupt me from getting intimate with her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi remained silent. Seeing that both sides were not intending to compromise, she giggled instead, “Why don’t we sleep together then? Chu Mu, you can sleep here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saying so, Ye Qingzi shifted her body a little and left a space at the center of the bed for Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu opened his mouth wide and looked at Ye Qingzi in utter disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What are her intentions? Is she openly allowing me to flirt with other women?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ye Qingzi had silently allowed the matter with Princess Jin Rou to slide, Chu Mu felt that it was the bottom line for her already. Yet now she was leaving a space on the bed which allowed him to sleep between Ning Maner and her......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the usually calm Chu Mu felt perplexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh, I will just go sleep in another room,” Eventually, Chu Mu resisted the temptation and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu realized that after marrying Qingzi, his female acquaintances had become stranger and stranger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you sure you don’t want to come?” Ye Qingzi raised her brows. Her sparkling beautiful eyes contained a trace of provocation within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t mind at all, what’s there for big brother to be worried about?” Ning Maner also added a dangerous line at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I mind!” refused Chu Mu in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who knows if these two are just setting up a trap for me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi might just instantly change her attitude after he got onto the bed, while Ning Maner shouts “I knew big brother had ulterior motives”. There was no need to intentionally jump into the trap set by those two little devils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop it, Maner, return to your room,” Ye Qingzi knew that Chu Mu was handling the matter in Ice City recently. She could tell from his mental state that he had recently been tiring himself out, so she stopped teasing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong with sleeping together? I can sleep at big sister’s side, and big brother can sleep at the corner,” pouted Ning Maner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Some wolves will still stretch their claws to the sheep even if their wives are watching,” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s true,” Ning Maner nodded and got out of the bed slowly. She strolled towards Chu Mu with her bare feet and a semi-transparent sleepwear covering her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner closed the door after leaving the room and stopped teasing Chu Mu too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ning Maner left, Chu Mu started undressing himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you tired?” Ye Qingzi walked over and gently helped him undress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A little too many had died this time,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong?” Ye Qingzi was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A creature from the Wind Palace has awakened. Qingzi, help me investigate something,” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had exhausted quite the amount of stamina in the Ice City incident. He was going to be taking on that Extreme Sky Ice Beast next, so he needed to recover his strength as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were hundreds of thousands of people in the inner city of Ice City, their lives could be considered to be placed entirely in Chu Mu’s hands. He had to make sure that they would be safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
