 <p><strong>Chapter 3: Split Off Hidden Dragon Egg</strong></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky above a distant sea, two enormous wing type soul pets with bodies that were larger than ten meters flitted across. Their speeds were rather quick.</span></p>
 <p>“It’s finally appeared, after an entire four years…”</p>
 <p>“Inform the others. This time we cannot let it wander off!” The winged type soul pet was carrying a man wearing a deep, yellow robe.</p>
 <p>These two people were Spirit Emperors sent by The Soul Alliance to search for the escaped Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon.</p>
 <p>Spirit Emperors were soul pet trainers at a higher level than Spirit Lords. They possessed 5 souls, and they could simultaneously control five soul pets at once!</p>
 <p>Nightmare Palace controlled the Heng Ocean, and even though the Soul Alliance didn’t need to fear any other power, Nightmare Palace had always been a group of violent tempered people. If people from the Soul Alliance were to cause a commotion on their territory, then Nightmare Palace wouldn’t hesitate to slaughter these people and their soul pets.</p>
 <p>“Tian Ting, I’ve heard that each time the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon pupates, it will leave behind a younger generation. Is this true?” The evidently younger Spirit Emperor asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Although the younger generation’s strength will be inferior to that of the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, it’s still capable of demolishing many people.” Said the man called Tian Ting.</p>
 <p>“Inferior to the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon… If that’s the case, the Alliance Master probably won’t worry about it…”</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you about it later. Right now, we had better quickly bring the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon back.” said the Soul Emperor Tian Ting.</p>
 <p>The young Soul Emperor didn’t question any further and closely followed Tian Ting, urging his soul pet to fly into the depths of the ocean.</p>
 <p>In the middle of Prison Island.</p>
 <p><span style>“Small Fellow, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p>Chu Mu could feel the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s exhaustion. From a greater perspective, the omnipresent and mysterious powerful creature was clearly a bit stronger than the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon. Moreover, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon had just emerged from its pupa, so its strength probably had not been completely recovered yet.</p>
 <p>Under these circumstances, fighting the terrifying creature and even repelling it, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon had paid an extremely painful price.</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha”</p>
 <p>The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon produced a voice familiar to Chu Mu. However, regardless if Chu Mu used the Beast Language or not, he was unable to understand its expressed intention.</p>
 <p>However, just at this instant, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s body began to slowly shrink. From a height where Chu Mu had to look up, it quickly transformed into a small Hidden Dragon that was covered in cyan insect armor at Chu Mu’s height.</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha”</p>
 <p>The small fellow stood in front of Chu Mu and its body swayed a bit. It seemed to be urgently telling Chu Mu something.</p>
 <p>“You’re saying that you have to leave. There’s someone chasing you?” Chu Mu tried to ask.</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha~” The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon instantly nodded its head and walked a step closer to Chu Mu. It slowly extended its exceptionally sharp claws and put it on Chu Mu’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Shoulder? The thing on my shoulder?”</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha~~”</p>
 <p>“You’re referring to Mo Xie?”</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha~~” The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon instantly nodded its head.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu was extremely uncertain why the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon was paying a lot of attention to Mo Xie. Chu Mu had encountered the small fellow first on Cyan Nightmare Island, before he encountered Mo Xie. Moreover, this small fellow had helped Chu Mu capture Mo Xie.</p>
 <p>“Sha sha”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon began swaying as if it was about to fall. From inside its thick cyan armor, cyan colored blood abruptly seeped out .</p>
 <p>Chu Mu could sense the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s weakened state. Perhaps its species race wasn’t inferior to the mysterious and powerful sovereign of Prison Island, but after its evolution, it wasn’t as strong as this mysterious creature. During this battle, it had definitely sustained heavy injuries.</p>
 <p>“You want me to protect her? Okay, I understand, I will protect her.” Chu Mu understood the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s state of mind and immediately responded. &nbsp;Despite being very suspicious towards the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s relationship with Mo Xie, he could see that the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon cared a lot about Mo Xie.</p>
 <p>After making Chu Mu understand its expressed intention, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s eye expression changed. It slowly opened its mouth as if it was about to spit out something.</p>
 <p>Cyan colored blood spilled out of its mouth when suddenly its throat expanded. It was like something was rising up from its throat.</p>
 <p>Gradually, that object rolled up from its throat into its mouth. The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon slowly lowered its head, while being exceptionally careful as it placed the object from its mouth onto the ground.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu was stunned. His gaze rested on the dragon egg spat out by the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, which was covered in viscous cyan saliva !</p>
 <p>“This is…” Chu Mu was rather astonished as he watched the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s peculiar actions. For a while, he was at a loss.</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha…”</p>
 <p>The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon began to use its limbs to tell Chu Mu what to do.</p>
 <p>“You want me to make a soul pact with it?”</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha…”</p>
 <p>“Let it become strong and then protect myself and Mo Xie?” asked Chu Mu.</p>
 <p>“Sha sha sha”</p>
 <p>The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon no longer spoke. Yet, when its gaze fell on the Hidden Dragon egg, its expression turned gentle with a tinge of ostensible reluctance.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, quickly, it raised its head once more as its wings covered in cyan blood stains spread open.</p>
 <p>After glancing at Chu Mu, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon abruptly flapped its wings, directly flying into the sky. Its body quickly rushed into the black night sky.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu clasped the viscous Hidden Dragon egg and stared at the injured Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon far away. From his heart rose forth a sliver of ineffable sentiment…</span></p>
 <p>The cyan silhouette gradually disappeared into the night sky. Although he didn’t know where the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon was going, Chu Mu felt that the small fellow definitely harbored many sad stories. Otherwise, the expression in its eyes wouldn’t be so exhausted and full of the vicissitudes of life…</p>
 <p>His soul power had already recovered a bit. To keep safe, Chu Mu summoned Mo Xie beside him.</p>
 <p>When Mo Xie appeared, she crawled onto Chu Mu’s shoulder where she let out a howl.</p>
 <p>The reason Chu Mu could understand the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, for the most part, was thanks to Mo Xie’s translations. Otherwise, it would have been very hard for Chu Mu to understand the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s intentions from its speech and limb movement.</p>
 <p>“What did you talk about with the small fellow earlier. You seem to be well acquainted with each other?” asked Chu Mu</p>
 <p>Previously, Mo Xie and the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon had communicated in Chu Mu’s mental space. Chu Mu simply could not understand these words. Additionally, he couldn’t understand why the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon cared so much about Mo Xie. Reasonably speaking, the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon should not have been so familiar with Mo Xie.</p>
 <p>“Wuwuwu~~” Mo Xie let out a small voice.</p>
 <p>“You feel that the post-evolution small cyan bug is very familiar?”</p>
 <p>“Wuwu~”</p>
 <p>“It brought you away? You used to recognize it? Why would it bring you away?”</p>
 <p>“Wuwu~~”</p>
 <p>“You also don’t know… you only know that after it transformed into the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon, it’s aura became very familiar…” Chu Mu bitterly laughed. He was increasingly unable to understand the relationship between Mo Xie and the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon.</p>
 <p>“Then, you aren’t leaving with it because…” Chu Mu rubbed her supple fur, but suddenly stopped his question midway.</p>
 <p>When Chu Mu asked this question, little Mo Xie extended her smooth tongue and began licking his face. This action answered Chu Mu, indicating that he didn’t need to ask this question...</p>
 <p>The surface of the ocean was occasionally like a ripple emerging in a mirror. The stars in the sky projected identical colors, and adorned the ocean surface with a unique starry picture.</p>
 <p>In the mutually reflecting aesthetic scenery, a dark blue figure full of the aura of an emperor appeared. Slowly, it flew along the ocean’s surface.</p>
 <p>Ostensibly waiting for something, this enormous figure flapped its wings and, when a few fast flying soul pets caught up chasing, it finally increased its speed and flew in a different direction above the ocean.</p>
 <p>Soon, the enormous figure was followed by multiple powerful wing type soul pets. On these soul pets was a powerful person controlling them!</p>
 <p>“It’s injured. It’s futile to flee this time!!” Tian Ting quickly saw the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s abnormality and spoke to the others.</p>
 <p>After speaking, Tian Ting looked at the few people behind him and proceeded to say: “You guys search along the route the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon just came from. See if it left its Hidden Dragon Egg on that island!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!!” Three soul pet trainers controlling their Thunder Feather Lions immediately changed direction and began searching in the direction that the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon came from.</p>
 <p>“This is Nightmare Palace’s territory. Nightmare Palace’s people have probably obtained information and are heading towards this place. You guys must not have a conflict with the experts from Nightmare Palace. You can only have a fight as a last resort!” Tian Ting was clearly the leader of these people. In an extremely stern manner, he spoke to his underlings.</p>
 <p>“We understand!!” the others immediately answered.</p>
 <p>Tian Ting’s gaze quickly locked onto the enormous figure that they were slowly getting closer to. If he hadn’t determined that the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon was wounded, Tian Ting would not dare to approach this berserk super creature.</p>
 <p>“Soon our four year mission will end.” The Spirit Emperor who had previously spoken with Tian Ting spoke in a tired voice.</p>
 <p>Tian Ting indifferently nodded his head, but his expression remained grave as he stared at the &nbsp;Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon flapping its wings.</p>
 <p>In reality, even until now, Tian Ting hadn’t truly relaxed.</p>
 <p>This was because he was the only one among these people that knew that bringing back the &nbsp;Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon was only one of his missions in the past four years. Truthfully, searching for the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon could be regarded as a presupposition believed by many.</p>
 <p>In Tian Ting’s heart was an even more important mission. This mission was given by the highest leaders of Soul Alliance, and he was the only one who knew of this heavy responsibility!!</p>
 <p>“When the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon fled Soul Alliance, it brought an extremely valuable soul pet egg with it. The Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon’s intelligence was already very mature, so it was hard to control. If we’re able to bring it back, we’ll try our best to do so. If not, we will retake its Hidden Dragon Egg. However, the soul pet egg the Empyrean Cyan Hidden Dragon is guarding must absolutely be recovered. Remember, we must do so at all costs!!!”</p>
 <p>These words reverberated through Tian Ting’s mind. It could be said that in the ten years Tian Ting was in Soul Alliance, this was the first time he had seen Soul Alliance’s Alliance Master reveal such an unrestrained and unconcealed expression!!</p>
