 <p>The scene was getting more and more fuzzy. The only thing Chu Mu could see was the little girl. She opened her teary eyes wide and tried her best not to cry, yet tears flowed out uncontrollably regardless.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu walked beside her and suddenly noticed one tear hanging in mid air, suspended in time and space.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu subconscious extended a hand to catch it. The tear became a crystal that fell on Chu Mu’s palm, icy with the despair of a young girl!</p>
 <p>“Monument Tear…..” Chu Mu looked at this tear, and was despondent.</p>
 <p>Around him was a scene that had happened many years ago and was untouchable. However, this tear fell solidly into Chu Mu’s palm.</p>
 <p>A tear that traveled through space and time?</p>
 <p>Not really. This tear had already been created at the time, and was stored in the heaven boundary monument’s ground. One could say that this special tear caused Chu Mu to see the scenes in the past.</p>
 <p>This was a tear that belonged to Ning Maner. Because of Chu Mu’s soul pact with her, Chu Mu could see the memory that broke Ning Maner’s heart.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>All the scenes before them disappeared. Chu Mu still stood in place, his hand holding the real tear as his heart continued to be moved.</p>
 <p>Her weak crying still seemed to resonate in his ears. Chu Mu closed his eyes and swallowed slightly.</p>
 <p>A man in a black scarf…...</p>
 <p>Chu Mu already completely remembered his face. Those two avaricious cheek bones have to be shattered!</p>
 <p>After a long while, Chu Mu carefully stored the tear away. He remained standing under the Heaven Boundary Monument to see if it told him anything more.</p>
 <p>Sadly, the heaven boundary monument left Ning Maner’s tear for him but didn’t tell him anything else after.</p>
 <p>The sun slowly fell. Chu Mu knew that at night, the Heaven Boundary Monument falls asleep and became an icy cold monument so he didn’t stay for any longer and went back to Lin City.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Purple Mountain Villa</p>
 <p>In the hall, Ye Wansheng looked sincerely at the Old Sect Master and said, “There really is no cure to this, it’s just two or three days of itching and you’ll be fine.”</p>
 <p>The Old Sect Master was nearly in tears. It was only a day but High Official He already scratched his skin off. In two or three more days, he won’t be recognizable!</p>
 <p>“Prince Ye, please help me think of a way to alleviate it at least. You don’t have any major grudge with each other, why push it to this extent……” Old Sect Master begged.</p>
 <p>They were finally welcoming a high position person in Divine Sect. Old Sect Master wanted to treat him well, so maybe they could ask Divine Sect for help when they needed it. Yet, with Ye Wansheng’s trouble, the High Official He probably would hate Beast Palace as well.</p>
 <p>“Alright, seeing as you’re so sincere, go get some young boy urine and tell him to sit in it for one or two hours- that’ll fix it.” Ye Wansheng said.</p>
 <p>“Young…. Young boy piss…..” Old Sect Master’s face was twisted.</p>
 <p>A High official in Divine Sect was an insane position. He wouldn’t even use normal water to wash his body, let alone urine. If he were told to step in it, he’d rather kill himself!</p>
 <p>Finally, Old Sect Master had to leave helplessly. If Old Sect Master knew that he was taking in a troublemaker like Ye Wansheng, even if he had to anger Xiao Xiao, he definitely would have rejected them!</p>
 <p>”You’re telling him to bathe in young boy urine….” Xiao Xiao burst out into laughter. Ye Wansheng really was bad. There was an antidote, yet he told them to go bathe in urine.</p>
 <p>Aside, Pang Yue felt Ye Wansheng truly went over the line. If they came for trouble…. Divine Sect wasn’t easy to mess with.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>In another villa, in a well lit elegant room, a row of servant girls were kneeled down with their heads lowered, all frightened as they faced the door.</p>
 <p>There were constant calls of itching and pain in the room, and even the sound of ripping skin…..</p>
 <p>“What, you’re telling High Official He to bathe in….” An angry and surprised voice came from the room.</p>
 <p>Within the room, the Old Sect Master had a bitter face, and said this method to High Official He. Yet, before he even said anything, his subordinates started shouting out loud.</p>
 <p>“Don’t waste time, quick….. quick, help me get some!” Upper Official He nearly lost his mind being itched by these poisonous bugs. He no longer cared about the urine, as long as he could get these bugs off.</p>
 <p>The Old Sect Master naturally already told people to prepare it. In the beast palace, there were still a decent amount of young disciples so it didn’t take long for them to gather it.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a large basin of “antidote” was brought forth. The servant girls added hot water and wrinkled their noses as they poured the foul urine into the bath.</p>
 <p>Waves of odor wafted outwards. The Divine Sect men and women outside the bath were all weirded out at the thought of their respected High Official He bathing in it…. The very thought was dirty!</p>
 <p>“Cai Yun, who do you think did this to High Official He?” A man said.</p>
 <p>“Definitely the two people from that day, especially the one that smiled as he apologized. Have you forgotten? When he was apologizing he faked tripped and definitely threw the poisonous powder onto High Official He then.” The girl named Cai Yun said with anger.</p>
 <p>“En, I feel so too. I heard about this already, they seem to be beast palace guests and live in purple mountain villa.” The white-clothed man said.</p>
 <p>“We can’t let them go free! Poisoning a Divine Sect member is a great crime!” Cai Yun gritted her teeth.</p>
 <p>“Yes, such a person definitely has hurt countless innocents and can be removed without hesitation!” The white-clothed man agreed, as if he would agree to anything Cai Yun said!</p>
 <p>After an hour, High Official He finally stopped itching.</p>
 <p>When it was near midnight, High Official he finally couldn’t stand the smell and immediately told them to switch the bath to get rid of the odor.</p>
 <p>All sorts of perfumes were added into the water. Though it easily washed away the smell on him, for some reason, High Official He felt as if he still had the smell. Even his few companions seemed to distance themselves from him intentionally!</p>
 <p>The poisonous bugs were already wiped out so High Official He’s logic and pride slowly came back. Thinking back to how he stayed in that urine for an hour, he felt an unprecedented amount of shame!</p>
 <p>After treatment, High Official He’s skin started healing, but the deep scars on his face were still unable to be cleared. After donning his clothes, even deep into the night, High Official He couldn’t fall asleep from the rage boiling in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Wanjun, have you figured out where they are?” He asked in a frigid voice.</p>
 <p>“They live in purple mountain villa.” The white-clothed man named Wan Jun said.</p>
 <p>“Bring some powerful people, set down a barrier. Remember, don’t alert the Old Sect Master.” High Official, He was already showing killing intent in his tone!</p>
 <p>“High Official He, Boss Xu told us not to cause trouble…." Another man said in a low voice.</p>
 <p>A cold glance from High Official He caused him to immediately shut up.</p>
 <p>To a person that just bathed in urine, calm and logic didn’t exist. As for reporting back to his higher-ups, he never even thought of it!</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Deep in the silent night, a few extremely quick figures floated over the bridge. They didn’t alert any of the patrolling disciples and entered straight into the mountain.</p>
 <p>Divine Sect had many diagrams, including barriers that could block power fluctuations and soundwaves. Such barriers were perfect in this situation. It often wouldn’t affect anyone.</p>
 <p>Putting down the barrier, High Official He and a few Divine Sect members with their faces covered appeared outside the villa door.</p>
 <p>High Official He covered his face not so he couldn’t get recognized but because his scars haven’t healed up. Yet, even with his face covered with a strip of cloth, his anger was still evident through his slightly shaking face!</p>
 <p>It was midnight, most people were asleep.</p>
 <p>However, maybe because of Chu Mu, Ye Wansheng, Prince Chao, and Pang Yue didn’t sleep and all meditated in their rooms. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of the three, Ye Wansheng had the highest remembrance. When he was meditating, he vaguely felt the entire mountain going especially silent.</p>
 <p>Ye Wansheng has been in society for many years now. He himself has done plenty of dirty deeds. He was sure that after getting rid of the poisonous bugs, the Divine Sect people would come over. However, Ye Wansheng didn’t expect them to come so quickly and set up a barrier, as if they wanted to kill them while the night was dark.</p>
 <p>“Prince Chao, they’re here.” Ye Wansheng said through his room wall to Chao Lengchuan.</p>
 <p>“I know, want me to wake pang Yue and Xiao Xiao?” Chao Lengchuan asked.</p>
 <p>“No, let us two do it. It’s finally a chance where Chu Mu isn't here.” Ye Wansheng said.</p>
 <p>“True. However, that High Official He really seems to be powerful. I don't know if we’re his match.” Chao Lengchuan said.</p>
 <p>“So what, let’s fight first.” Ye Wansheng said.</p>
 <p>Troublemaking was Ye Wansheng’s species technique. Using his words, he could keep himself in constant combat with this!</p>
 <p>“En, but if we can’t beat it, let’s tell Chu Mu’s bodyguard to help us. I remember Chu Mu didn’t bring it with him.” Chao Lengchuan said.</p>
 <p>“The top tier dominator rank white nightmare emperor? Was it not following Chu Mu?” Ye Wansheng was surprised.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Chu Mu left in a hurry this time, wanting to get to the heaven boundary monument before sunset so he forgot to bring his sleeping bodyguard.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, great, then we can fight freely against these Divine Sect fools. I’ve been tired of looking at them!” Ye Wansheng said.</p>
