 <p><strong>Chapter 163: Insect Blood, Insect Guts</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been about ten days. If the people inside haven’t been poisoned to death by the Heavenly Devil Insect poison, then they would have died due to the lack of air. If they have a plant type soul pet, they might barely be able to survive for a bit longer. If they don’t…” as the man spoke, his face turned a bit more unsightly. His gaze was fixated on the area covered in a condensed black cloud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The region was a field of darkness, and it was extremely easy to get lost. From time to time, one would be able to see half a head pop out of a thick liquid encased corpse. These bundled corpses hadn’t been directly eaten, because these Heavenly Devil Insects wanted to use them as ‘cold storage’. They would wait for a new devil insect egg to hatch before feeding them to these small devil insects that needed to eat very badly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Ye Wansheng have a plant type soul pet?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi shook her head, and her face turned rather grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In this area, what is the strongest Heavenly Devil Insect?” asked Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An eighth phase ninth stage Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect. Apparently it has undergone attribute strengthening, and it isn’t easy to deal with. Aside from that, there are also four eighth phase low staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects. Amongst us is one expert who can deal with the one Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect King. However, we can’t deal with the other four. If we can’t find people to handle the four eighth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insects, he isn't willing to risk going out.” said the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re missing a few people, but she and I can each deal with one eighth phase low staged Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect each.” Chu Mu said to the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two?” the man let out a half convinced expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man was a guard of this district and was called Zhang Qian. He himself could deal with an eighth phase low staged strengthened Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect. Presently, under him, he had thirty subordinate spirit teachers. When these thirty spirit teachers worked together, it probably wouldn’t be a problem to deal with the other Six Winged Heavenly Devil INsect. The problem was that they lacked three experts who could deal with eighth phase Six Winged Devil Insects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These sorts of experts did exist in Wogu City, but they had been deployed to other districts. What manifested was a pressing circumstance where guard Zhang Qian continued to search for people, but was fruitless in his search.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very normal that Zhang Qian didn’t quite trust Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi. They looked about twenty years old, and there were only a few soul pet trainers around this age who could deal with an eighth phase commander in the entire Wogu Region. He was worried that this pair of male and female were trying to be brave in the heat of the moment because they were anxious about the people inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi really was worried about her brother. When she saw that the guard didn’t believe her and Chu Mu she simply pointed at Chu Mu and said: “He’s Chu Mu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who cares who you are. A human life is beyond value…” said guard Zhang Qian. Suddenly, he realized that Chu Mu’s name sounded familiar. His voice gradually quieted and his face let out an astonished expression, “You are the Prison Island King- Chu Mu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… then that’s truly too great… we have a savior, we have a savior.” Zhang Qian let out an ecstatic expression. Zhang Qian had naturally heard of Chu Mu’s name before. With a Royal Flamed Nine Tailed Inferno Fox, he could be considered an expert, and further adding on his other powerful soul pets, it definitely wasn’t a problem to deal with an unstrengthened eighth phase commander.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First explain the situation and the plan.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Qian immediately adjusted his emotions and became rather serious. He said: “That expert’s soul pets have already scouted it out. The eighth phase high staged strengthened Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect can be completely handed to him. The remaining four will respectively be handed to you, me and this lady. If we need another, then we can recruit a guard from another district… Huh, these two rings… did you two receive a guard’s entrustment en route ?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, what’s the matter?” nodded Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, he’s my friend. How about this, you two first deliver the two rings to the requested area, and I’ll bring over that expert. We’ll make our move first thing in the morning tomorrow.” said guard Zhang Qian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.” Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi nodded their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember to prepare a few medicines that can resist poison. The poisonous attribute of the Heavenly Devil Insects are very powerful.” warned Zhang Qian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s a soul teacher.” said Chu Mu as he pointed at Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s words instantly caused Zhang Qian’s eyes to light up. If there was a soul teacher in the team, then everyone’s safety factor would raise by a lot. After all, a soul teacher was definitely extremely proficient in healing, curing, detoxification and other abilities of this sort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi weren’t considered to be too far away from the city east location. Since they wouldn’t make their move until early next morning, the two of them didn’t have to be so rushed. En route, Chu Mu summoned Zhan Ye and the Devil Tree Battle Soldier to have them dispose of the Heavenly Devil Insects they encountered, in addition to giving them opportunities to train.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both their actions were very quick, and approximately two hours later, they arrived at the eastern part of the city. They proceeded to the guard tower and handed over the spatial rings to the distribution guard urgently in need of foods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That guard originally planned on paying Chu Mu a commission, but Chu Mu didn’t need it, and instead exchanged it for a plethora of Heavenly Devil Insect blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’d planned on gathering this blood to have a pharmacist process it. After filtering out the poison, we would barely be able to give it to someone who was about to die of thirst. Since you need it, then we’ll give it all to you. We’re very thankful to the two of you for your help. Wogu City’s citizens will remember you two.” the guard didn’t stop expressing his thanks to Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s only equivalent to blood from seventy Heavenly Devil Insects…” Chu Mu bitterly laughed as he shook his head. Although he had obtained a lot of Heavenly Devil Insect blood from the guard, there ostensibly was a large distance to reaching 1000. Chu Mu had to start slaughtering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Wood Tray Spirit also needs to train. Let’s return there and annihilate the Heavenly Devil Insects on the edge of the nest. You train your Zhan Ye, and I’ll train my Wood Tray Spirit. This way, we’ll be able to collect more blood.” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tomorrow, first thing in the morning, they would need to begin fighting. Presently, there was still a bit of time before night, so there naturally was no need to hurry back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.” Chu Mu happened to have this plan as well. Zhan Ye’s fighting strength recovered very quickly, and despite continuously fighting at night, his mental strength would still be plentiful for the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Zhan Ye hasn’t undergone insect gut nourishment?” Ye Qingzi asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. What insect gut?” Chu Mu let out a questioning expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then when you collect blood, you can also collect insect guts. I’ll help you mix a fifth level insect gut. This way, your Warbeast Mo Ye’s strength can increase a bit faster. Your Mo Ye’s life force is extremely strong, and it probably shouldn’t have an issue taking a sixth level insect gut. So, actually, I’ll mix a sixth level insect gut.” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu didn’t expect insect guts would have this kind of efficacy. It was no wonder many people liked to train in the wild with soul teachers. Soul teachers would always be able to excavate various spirit items and hasten a soul pet’s strength increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hou!! Hou!!!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>During the night, at edge of the devil insect nest could be heard indignant roars echoing out of the narrow and deep streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Mo Ye’s figure incessantly scuttled through the night. Zhan Ye’s tiger body was covered in an armor all over, and it abruptly jumped. Continuously borrowing strength through leveraging the adjacent rooms, he went to and fro multiple times. Yet, when he jumped onto the top of the house, his Shattering Claws fiercely smashed into a sixth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body had already been bound by the roots extending from the roof. It was unable to dodge despite wishing to, and it could only cover its body with its six flesh wings!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beng!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark light flickered on the claw and, as the Shattering Claw abruptly smashed downwards, it instantly split the Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s flesh wings open. Dripping blood flew everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ink Armor Spike!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The order was given, and the spur-like ink armor spikes on Zhan Ye’s body suddenly extended. They soundly pierced the Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The poison poured in, and the Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s insect armor was instantly dyed in a dark color, corroding its insect armor defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pu pu!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two roots that looked like long pointed spears outlandishly appeared. They very accurately pierced into the Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s insect armor, directly passing through its body. Immediately, blood began to seep out of the bloody hole...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thing that shot out the root puncture was naturally Ye Qingzi’s Wood Tray Spirit. It was currently at the fifth phase seventh stage, and when it attacked previously, it would have been extremely hard to break through the sixth phase Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s defense. Zhan Ye’s poison invaded the Six Winged Heavenly Devil Insect’s body before it was instantly pierced and left without resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“110 blood liters of Heavenly Devil Insects and 30 insect guts. These 30 insect guts should be able to concoct the sixth level insect gut, right?” Chu Mu recalled Zhan Ye, and questioned the adjacent Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it’s enough.” nodded Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire night was practically an unending battle. Chu Mu’s Zhan Ye increased from the fifith phase fifth stage to the fifth phase sixth stage. Ye Qingzi also expressed that the sixth level insect gut would probably allow Zhan Ye to increase another stage. After tonight, Zhan Ye would enter the fifth phase seventh stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kind of increasing speed was probably considered relatively fast. After all, Chu Mu’s Ice Air Fairy had reached the sixth phase seventh stage, and the Devil Tree Battle Soldier was only at the sixth phase fourth stage. Zhan Ye being able to chase after them so quickly from a low phase and stage meant his growth and innate talent could be regarded as comparatively high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s time possessing soul pets was relatively short- only about five years. His soul pets’ phase and stages were generally pretty low. The reason why he was able to defeat stronger soul pets was because Chu Mu extremely emphasized a soul pet’s attribute strengthening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attribute strengthening could allow a soul pet’s fundamental abilities to be even stronger. However, when increasing phase and stages, there would be many barriers. In the future, Chu Mu would place his attention on quickly increasing his soul pet’s phase and stages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s rest. Recover our soul power, and first thing tomorrow, we’ll enter the devil insect nest.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok.” nodded Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The district still had a few remaining intact rooms where Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi could stay. They were soul pet trainers, and their vigilance was relatively high. They also had the strength to deal with Heavenly Devil Insects, so they didn’t have to hide in cellars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu maintained a good silent cultivation habit and began to recover his soul power. As for Ye Qingzi, after mixing the insect gut for Chu Mu, she taught Chu Mu how to use the insect bladder before silently sitting to the side and recovering her soul power...</span></p>
