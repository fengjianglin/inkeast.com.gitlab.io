 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark ocean pirates suffered a heavy blow ten years ago and almost disappeared. However, in recent years, they had staged a comeback and were developing swiftly. Their bounty went from the initial hundred xuan to nearly ten thousand, and now it was multiples of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wupan navy’s main mission was to stop intruders as well as to wage war against their seafaring neighbors. But, just like how lions found it difficult to kill rats, Wupan Navy never could do much about these pirates, leading to the discontent of the masses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After talking with Great Leader Xu Kuang for a moment, Hai Qie had prepared materials from all sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying farewell to Xu Kuang, they returned to their courtyards to start discussing how they would deal with the bandits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the seventh day, the new moon navy’s members were all present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To not be discovered by any dark ocean bandits’ scouts, the new moon navy were more low profile, as if they were simply going back to New Moon Ground after coming around this city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silver battleships started turning back towards the dark ocean with the impression of going back home. White waves were pushed apart as thirty battleships flew through the blue ocean. Not long ago, they were still on the port but in no time they disappeared into the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ships went at full speed. The young leader Zeng Bang was clearly very excited, raring to show his worth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, the other leader, Hai Qie, was clearly in a strange mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These days, Hai Qie always stood on the deck, staring into the turbulent seas as her thoughts wandered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew she was lost in her own thoughts, so no one disturbed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the night, clouds covered the skies. One couldn’t see moonlight or starlight. The entire world was sunken into darkness. Only the ocean was still lapping away against the boat, reminding everyone where they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu?” A pleasant voice came in the dark. A pair of light blue eyes were slightly twinkling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night was against Chu Mu’s back. When Chu Mu turned around, the small pale flame that danced on his finger tips lit up the end of the boat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver flame lit up the speaking person, causing Chu Mu to see the recently melancholic Hai Qie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hai Qie usually loved wearing short leather shirts, showing off a coastal city’s unique womanliness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked at her and smiled, “It’s you, are you having trouble sleeping?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was somewhat different from normal humans now. With dark type, night time was no longer a signal for him to go sleep and replenish his energy. Considering that his soul remembrance increasing was crucial to his overall strength, Chu Mu wouldn’t waste a single day of training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You seem a bit different from us? I heard that there are half human type people in this world. Are you that kind?” Hai Qie saw the small flame dancing on his hand and asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu controlled the flames and pushed it into the air and it turned into a floating white flame lamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I guess.” Chu Mu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does that mean you’re an offspring of a soul pet and a human….. Uh, sorry I didn’t mean to offend you.” Hai Qie realized that it came off as extremely rude and quickly apologized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“......” Chu Mu’s mouth slightly twitched. Hai Qie truly had a wild imagination, mentioning the offspring of soul pets and humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vast majority of species could not interbreed. Even mixed blood species have to come from the same large species.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting thought. In reality, half human species are all humans that accidentally became connected to some soul pet life form and caused it to be able to use soul pet abilities…” Chu Mu had to fix Hai Qie’s thoughts or else he would be a monster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s why. You seem to know half humans well? Have you seen others like you?” Hai Qie laughed apologetically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“New Moon Ground has three, including me. One is similar to me and is a half devil. His experiences are much more complicated than mine. The other…..” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The other must be the spectral princess always beside you, right?” Hai Qie asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook his head, “She doesn’t count. She’s just a specter because her body is dead. If we find a way to revive her, she’ll still be normal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then who is this last person, also a half devil?” Hai Qie gained a huge curiosity for half humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu shook her head and said, “She's a flower girl connected to an Evil Good Queen’s body.”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Flower woman? It looks like this world truly has a flower girl?” Hai Qie said astonishingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s similar to us two half devils. She was a human but became a part of the same body because of some circumstances. Of course, she has a much more complicated story.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then who’s the strongest out of you three? By half devil strength.” Hai Qie immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Us half devils are similar in strength, the flower woman is stronger than us.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Good Queen’s species rank was too high. Until now, that woman still hadn’t even reached the tenth phase. With all situations equal, Chu Mu and Bai Yu’s joint power and flame counter still might not be Evil Good Queen’s match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of which, many years ago, I saw a little girl that I couldn't tell if she was half human.” Hai Qie seemed to remember something and quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me about her.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She had many soul pets near her. Under normal circumstances, soul pet trainers can only summon five soul pets to battle. However, I saw dozens of powerful organisms around her all protecting her. I heard other type humans had the ability to communicate with soul pets…..” Hai Qie said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Hai Qie saying that, Chu Mu was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There really only was one person capable of having such approachability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you describe this little girl? Maybe I recognize her.” Chu Mu immediately said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She looks twelve or thirteen, slightly curly black hair, purple eyes…. I only had a quick glance because she had too many powerful organisms near her. I didn’t dare go near.” Hai Qie said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark curly hair, deep purple eyes, these two were enough to prove that Hai Qie was talking about Ning Maner because even till today, Chu Mu had never seen anyone else with purple eyes like hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I recognize the little girl you speak of. She doesn’t count as a half human. She just inherited a special power. She’s called Ning Maner- she is in Wupan Continent. My goal this time was to go looking for her.” Chu Mu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu asked Lan Rao about Ning Maner when he went to Guan City, yet Lan Rao said she didn’t know who Ning Maner was and was only doing what she was told by her higher ups. Her boss was He Cang, who once destroyed the pirates.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you meet her?” Chu Mu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner’s past and World Ancestor Tree were things that Chu Mu didn’t understand well even till today. Since he was specially looking for her this time, Chu Mu had to also figure out what happened in her past, and why she had to run away to New Moon Ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was many years ago.” Hai Qie fell into her memory. After a moment, she continued, “It was in my hometown, Wan City. When I went to honor my ancestors, I saw a large group of powerful organisms fly past in front of me. I went stock still, not daring to move because they were all way stronger than I was.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wan City was human territory, so suddenly having so many wild organisms appear was strange. Stranger still was that all these organisms were protecting the young girl you know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Maner has a special affinity with all wild soul pets. Even nightmares with their violent tendencies could be tamed. Those soul pets were likely all the World Ancestor Tree’s protectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chasing that little girl was a large group of powerful soul pet trainers, numbering around 1000. Some were as strong as immortal rank, while others were as weak as emperor rank. They chased and killed the entire way from wan city ruins to Guan Sea. Mountain-like soul pets fell over in the rain, endless soul pet corpses threatened to fill the entire bay. The entire ocean was dyed red.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was truly the most terrifying fight Hai Qie had ever seen. Powerful human immortal rank soul pets fighting with wild immortal ranks. The heavens and earth were all shaking. This was the first time Hai Qie truly witnessed destructive power. All these seemingly untouchable creatures were getting ripped up by the loyal protectors, sending flesh and blood everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thousand soul pet trainers, with even the weakest being top tier spirit emperor, just to fight a young girl and her thirty soul pets. This young girl’s soul pets fought and retreated, leaving a large group of bodies and blood in Hai Qie’s vision before disappearing deep into the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though it was a short time and it had been many years, Hai Qie still remembered it like yesterday. Especially the loyalty of the protector soul pets caused Hai Qie to be shaken. Just what kind of young girl needed so many top tier soul pets’ lives to be sacrificed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hai Qie described it in detail. Chu Mu could almost see how desperate and bleak the scene was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking back to all the stormy nights where Ning Maner had to hug him to be able to fall asleep, Chu Mu’s heart was deeply moved.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was just a young girl trying to mature. Her childhood was spent like a worryless butterfly. She could stay happy and dance for the rest of her life. Yet, life had to put her through the stark contrast between ugly human nature’s greed and the loyal protectors sworn to protect her. This was truly a large hit to a pure soul like her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing worth being happy for was that she was still mentally well and firm. Every time Chu Mu told her off, she would always adamantly deny her fear of stormy nights.</span></p>
