 <p><strong>Chapter 242: A Case With Boundless Danger</strong></p>
 <p><span style>A savage creature with intelligence!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so terrifying that it could target city guards. It was able to use the lives of ordinary civilians to set a trap and make the soul pets of the city guards that protected the safety of this city into food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a frightening species existed in this bright and flourishing city, inhabiting the small alleys that people frequently walked to and fro in. While taking a walk at night or even deep in the slumber of dreams, there was a chance that they could pass right by you. Whether they took your life or not was all predicated on their dreadful scheme...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu’s heart was heavy. It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen death before, but the intelligence of these creatures made the hairs on Chu Mu’s back stand up. It was like the catastrophic-like desolate hibernation from back then had arrived...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingzi wanted to say something, but upon thinking about the devastating things that had just happened, an ineffable emotion surged up in her heart, and she could only silently follow beside Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the second day, the news was buried by the city government.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last night, a total of 100 city guards and 10 aerial guards, as well as the three hundred civilians that had acted as bait, all lost their lives in the city. This could be said to be Li City’s most unprecedented shocking murder case!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this terrifying news was resolutely suppressed by Li City’s government with its most immediate force. Ultimately, it manifested into a rumor that a group of underground faction soul pet trainers had started a fight in the city center’s Western Street, causing several deaths and wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three days, in three days you’ll solve this problem for me. If you haven’t found the murderers in three days and moreover cleanly wiped them out, I’ll throw you onto the center Western Street for a night!” The city general in charge of Li City’s safety angrily smacked the table giving a military order to the city officials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Center district official Li Gu was terrified as well. Since Center Street’s resident area wasn’t officially a Li City district, there hadn’t been enough focus put on that area. Even if something happened there, the district official would suppress the news before dealing with it privately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Central district official Li Gu originally thought that it was the evil work of fugitives as well. If he dispatched a few city guards to patrol then it would be fine; yet, he didn’t expect for this matter to be so terrifying that it would become a shocking massacre in the district.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing beside central district official Li Gu was aerial guard deputy Dong Qing. He hadn’t slept the entire night and looked very miserable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Last night, Dong Qing had changed shifts with another deputy and returned earlier to rest. Thus, he wasn’t among the ten aerial guards. Therefore, while he was fortunate to have escaped the calamity, he also lost a few comrades. This sorrowful haze that arose from after hearing the news last night had shrouded over him. It made him sink into a state where he was on the verge of exploding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the city general left, the district official Li Gu bade him farewell before returning not much later. His face was gloomy as he sat back down at his spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This hall was currently full of all the city and aerial guard deputy ranked and above members. These people were all silent, not even saying a sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Gu’s sigh gradually rang out. It was a while before he said: “Li City is currently in a extremely alert state. This matter is truly exceptionally serious. However, we really can’t dispatch too many people; even now, I don’t know what it was that committed such a terrible act. Moreover, I don’t even know how many of these things there are. Therefore, we have to employ the help of some mercenaries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Shi, go and put up a bounty with a base reward of a few million. Find a few capable mercenaries to help us. The other captains lead your team; every ten people will form a team and will patrol in the city center’s Western Street…” said city district official Li Gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” all the captain seriously gave a salute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.” just at this moment, Chu Mu who had remained silent spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Chu Mu who gave the information to Dong Qing, and this was the reason why this matter was restricted before it could spread. Further, during the city official meeting, Chu Mu had listened off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Gu suspiciously looked at Chu Mu and confusedly asked: “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This person is the soul pet trainer that gave me the information.” explained Dong Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Gu glanced at Dong Qing. To Li Gu, the only good thing about this massacre was that Dong Qing hadn’t been among the dead, otherwise this matter would have been even more serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take back the order you gave just now. Right now we don’t even know the enemy’s numbers and method of hiding; rashly dispatching small teams to search Western Street isn’t very appropriate.” said Chu Mu solemnly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We happen to be the glorious city guards of an entire district; don’t tell me we would still be afraid?” said the district deputy official.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The city general had only given them three days to resolve this matter. Yet right now they didn’t even have a trail. These city officials were carrying immense pressure as well, and if they didn’t use a sweeping method to search, what other solution was there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those things used the lives of ordinary civilians to lure the city guards before making their soul pets into food. This means that their intelligence is extremely high. If we are to dispatch a large group of members to search Western Street, there are three outcomes. The first is that we find a trail and find their next target. Then, we’d engage in a large fight with these soul pets. If this is the outcome, we’d still have to consider exactly how many of these savage creatures live on Western Street. Moreover, we don’t know if your people can eliminate them. If they can, then this matter will be over, if they can’t, then we will just be raising an even more terrifying group of executioners and the situation would worsen.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Mu gave this explanation, everyone’s eyes fell on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The probability of the first is rather low because, since these soul pets were able to live for so many days, they definitely have some special method of concealment. Moreover, I fought with those things on the street and was chased nearly half a block. With my soul remembrance, I was still unable to understand their method of concealment. If everyone here has all reached the spirit master level, then we’d be able to use the sweeping method to search.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a spirit master?” everyone was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” said Chu Mu as he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A twenty year old spirit master was rare in the soul pet world. Previously, everyone had thought that this young man who wasn’t a city guard member and had suddenly run here to spread his words was a bit too strange. However, when Chu Mu indicated his strength, everyone grew serious after being shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This person is Chu Chen, and he is a wandering soul pet trainer. This is his friend, a soul teacher, Ye Qingzi. They had a bit of a realization towards those savage creatures that attacked our comrades. Everyone listen to their analysis before we plan a strategy.” Dong Qing himself was surprised towards Chu Mu’s level. However, he quickly and intentionally introduced Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yesterday when I encountered them, they were able to turn invisible. I believe that this terrifying technique will make you guys suffer defeat. At the moment, the invisibility ability cannot be seen through even with my spirit master remembrance. I managed to sense them because of my dark type demonic Night Thunder Dream Beast, so I’m not too supportive of you guys going to search…” Chu Mu continued to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dark thunder dual attribute Dream Beast!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Mu said the name of his soul pet, a few small gasps were heard. Everyone present was a deputy and above level soul pet trainer. They knew that the perceptive abilities of a Dream Beast were among the best among demons. If only a Night Thunder Dream Beast was able to see through them, then their sweeping method of searching really wouldn't be of any use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now I said there were three scenarios. The second scenario is that they have intelligence, and if you begin a large scale operation and cannot be beaten, they’ll definitely rely on their hiding abilities to hibernate for a while, waiting for you to loosen your guard before launching an attack…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The third scenario is that their strength is stronger than yours. Then the outcome is something you guys should understand…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Mu finished speaking, everyone felt a wave of cold air, especially when Chu Mu mentioned the third outcome!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing… nothing to be afraid of. We have at least 500 people and over a thousand soul pets….” the deputy city official’s confidence wavered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every captain was silent. When they thought of the 100 city guards that were killed without even managing to let out a signal further coupled with Chu Mu saying that these soul pets possessed an invisibility ability, they suddenly felt that the probability of this was actually very large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not saying the entire army will be annihilated, but you’ll definitely pay a price more painful than last night. I suggest that you gather an even larger amount, or have Li City’s city lord dispatch an elite team. These things rely on eating the flesh, soul core, and soul crystal of powerful things to raise their strength. If you dispatch too many troops before fundamentally understanding them, there’s a definite chance you’ll be sending food to them. This matter isn’t something manpower can resolve…” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do we do? The city general clearly indicated that he didn’t have enough people to invest here…” city official Li Gu displayed an unsightly face and his gaze specially fell on Dong Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true we can’t muster members.” Dong Qing gave a definite answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu looked at Dong Qing and felt that it was strange. Why was it that when such a tragic event occurred, Li City was still stingy with their members. Didn’t Li City’s city lord and that city general attach importance to the lives of over a hundred people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Qing saw Chu Mu’s confusion and bitterly laughed, saying: “It’s not convenient to divulge this case. In short, we can only rely on the members of this district now to resolve this matter. Brother Chu, since you were able to see through a bit into this matter, what should we do? The city general allocated 50 million gold coins for us to use. We can give a reward of at least 10 million; since you understand these things, I really hope that you can take this mission because we really don’t have even the slightest trail…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu hesitated a while. Before, Chu Mu really would have planned on taking the mission. After all, he still needed a large amount of gold to strengthen his soul pets. However, right now, it seemed that this matter wasn’t anything simple. Whether or not he had the ability to take the mission was the big question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll give it a shot. However, if the danger factor is extremely high, I hope that you can have an expert come and resolve it…” Chu Mu ultimately agreed to take the mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’m truly too thankful. I salute you on behalf of all my perished comrades!” Dong Qing gave Chu Mu an extremely serious salute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite being a case with boundless danger, it was still accepted. All the captains held Chu Mu with exceptional respect and when Chu Mu gave a salute, all the captains gave a simple gesture of respect.</span></p>
