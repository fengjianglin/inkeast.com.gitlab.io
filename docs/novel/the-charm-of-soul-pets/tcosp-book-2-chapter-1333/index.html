 <p>Stepping forward meant a spatial leap. The moment Chu Mu completely exploded forward, how could a small Light Eye mark do anything to him?</p>
 <p>Black and silver devil flames disappeared in place, and immediately, a terrifying aura shrouded everyone’s head!</p>
 <p>No one knew when the life-controlling devil would appear behind them, or whose heart would get pulled out and thrown to the ground like trash.</p>
 <p>Xu Lu’s soul remembrance kept covering the region, his eyes staring at the Light Eye mark from Light’s Fury.</p>
 <p>This Light's Eye would always appear above the organism and stare threateningly at it.</p>
 <p>Xu Lu wanted to use his Light's Eye to find the evil devil man. However, when he lifted his head, he was shocked to find that the Light's Eye started blinking around!</p>
 <p>The speed of blinking was something that Xu Lu’s eyes and soul remembrance couldn’t keep up. Sometimes, he even noticed the light eye appearing in multiple places!</p>
 <p>Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon showed a Light's Eye, the Immortal Blood Ghost showed a Light’s Eye, one appeared beside the Light Emperor. Even the Unifying Wind Unicorn had a light eye beside it!</p>
 <p>Xu Lu wasn’t stupid. He didn’t think that the Light’s Fury’s Light Eye technique had an issue. Clearly, the devil man was just moving too quick, faster than even the Light's Eye could move!</p>
 <p>“Xu Kuan, Guo Enlong, you two stay vigilant!” Xu Lu warned with his mental voice.</p>
 <p>Xu Lu and Guo Enlong both had elemental soul pets with low life force and defense. If the devil man neared them, they would get instantly killed!</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan’s soul remembrance covered his surrounding area. Light’s Fury was the weakest of all soul pets. Thinking back to how Kang Ruodong was killed, Xu Kuan’s neck started sweating.</p>
 <p>Guo Enlong’s situation wasn’t as bad. His soul pet was the Unifying Wind Unicorn. Though it was an elemental world soul pet, it had beast type, and was less likely to get instantly killed.</p>
 <p>Xu Lu was Xu Kuan’s brother, so naturally, he put more attention on Xu Kuan’s Light’s Fury, guessing that the black and white devil man may directly attack it!</p>
 <p>“Hu!!!!”</p>
 <p>The black and white both flames appeared at the center of the six immortal rank soul pets, its evil aura buffeting everyone!</p>
 <p>The Demon Beast Palace Huo Lei felt the evil aura the closest, because Chu Mu’s next target was the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon!</p>
 <p>The devil flames burned quietly. Demon Beast Palace Huo Lei found the devil less than ten meters from him. His eyes widened and stared in shock as it extended its silver devil flame palm towards his Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon!</p>
 <p>“Behind the Hidden Dragon!” Xu Lu was the first to notice Chu Mu, and warned everyone with his mental voice before immediately commanding his Light Emperor to fly towards the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon!</p>
 <p>Xu Lu truly was the strongest of the six of them. His reaction speeds were incredibly fast. One second slower and the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon definitely would have been ripped in half by Chu Mu’s black and white claws. After all, the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon had already been heavily injured in the last battle. Killing it would be too easy!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu turned around to find the beast form Light Emperor pouncing towards him.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu grabbed at the air and grabbed the wings of the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon right as it was trying to escape.</p>
 <p>The mountain-like Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon seemingly had zero weight as it was yanked back by Chu Mu’s spatial hand and thrown straight at the Light Emperor!</p>
 <p>The beast form Light Emperor had charged right at Chu Mu, not expecting it to instead run into a Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon. It was too late for it to move aside!</p>
 <p>“Beng!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon and the beast form light’s emperor slammed into each other. With the black nightmare’s abilities, Chu Mu’s raw power was also shocking. With the yank and throw, the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon was already dizzy, and could barely stand back up.</p>
 <p>The Light Emperor was much better off. This special light type organism already was surrounded by powerful light spears when it stood up!</p>
 <p>“Go, pierce it!” Xu Lu commanded!</p>
 <p>Every spear was a few thousand meters long. These spears disappeared with a chant from the Light Emperor.</p>
 <p>The next moment, Chu Mu’s surroundings were covered in piercing lights as the light spears appeared again!</p>
 <p>All around him, even below him, spears appeared and whistled towards him, creating trails through the air as they threatened to skewer Chu Mu!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu glanced over coldly. Light’s Fury pierced even alternate dimensions. Even if Chu Mu tried to move away using spatial power, it wouldn’t matter. And with the high amount of light spears, all chances of dodging were sealed off!</p>
 <p>The light spears were near. Chu Mu’s left eye black pupil suddenly moved at this moment!</p>
 <p>He extended the burning black left hand and lifted it over his head, clasping it shut!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, around Chu Mu, a spatial freezing energy rippled outwards!</p>
 <p>Space instantly froze as Chu Mu shut his arm. The massive light spears all went stationary at the same time!</p>
 <p>The spears that came so viciously couldn't move half an inch further, let alone pierce Chu Mu’s body.</p>
 <p>“Spatial control!” Xu Lu’s face turned darker.</p>
 <p>The supreme Other type power, the ability to control all the space nearby. Wherever the mind covered, the region inside was controlled by the other type organism. This was a power that Xu Lu had only ever seen in one other soul pet, one of the Magistrates of Divine Sect!</p>
 <p>As Xu Lu was shocked, the black and white devil man Chu Mu already used his soul remembrance to point the light spears towards the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon!</p>
 <p>His eyes sharped, and his killing intent reached a peak!</p>
 <p>Opening his left hand, the light spears flew at even higher speeds towards the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon!</p>
 <p>Other than Xu Lu, the others never have seen an organism able to forcefully flip a technique around. Without any preparation, Guo Enlong and Xue Yingfeng could only watch as the giant spears flew towards the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon!</p>
 <p>“Xu Kuan, help it absorb the light’s spear!” Xu Lu turned towards Xu Kuan.</p>
 <p>Xu Kuan’s reaction wasn’t slow. Its Light’s Fury in a short moment had completed an incantation to create a white shield in front of the dragon!</p>
 <p>With the light shield before it, the Demon Beast Palace Huo Lei finally relaxed a little. Its scales were burnt clean from the Black Hightmare beforehand. If the light spears landed directly, his Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon was dead for sure!</p>
 <p>Not far away, Chu Mu’s double evil eyes saw the white shield and only smiled, his cold expression becoming a sneer!</p>
 <p>His silver pupils flashed once, and all the light spears disappeared!</p>
 <p>The attack seemed instantly gone, leaving a massive shield in front of the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon standing alone.</p>
 <p>“Pu!!!!!”</p>
 <p>“Pu!!!”</p>
 <p>“Pu!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a massive group of light spears appeared!</p>
 <p>They appeared barely above the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon, bringing with it a powerful strength that pierced through the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon’s head, neck, back, and nailing it to the ground.</p>
 <p>The thousand meter light spears stuck right into the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon while it remained in its standing defensive stance, making it into a cruel mock of a taxidermy!</p>
 <p>Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon couldn’t even let out a screech before being pierced. Even its tail wasn’t spared!</p>
 <p>An immortal rank dragon nailed to the ground, with blood flying out of every spot of its body!</p>
 <p>The demon beast palace Huo Lei stood beside his Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon, the giant spears looking like straight mountains.</p>
 <p>Seeing the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon, Huo Lei’s entire body was stiff, since such a scary scene had caused his mind to stop running!</p>
 <p>“Pu!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>As the final light spear landed, it directly hit Huo Lei, who was still too shocked to react!</p>
 <p>Xu Lu and the other five all paused momentarily. When they came back to their senses, their hairs raised on their ends as they realised that where Huo Lei once stood, the only thing that remained was a giant light spear!</p>
 <p>The light shield in front of the Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon still stood floating there, looking lonely. This was in contrast with the unmoving and pierced Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon- it was more of a joke now.</p>
 <p>The man and dragon were both dead!!</p>
 <p>Out of everyone, the weakest was Demon Beast Palace Huo Lei. His Blood Barbarian Hidden Dragon’s wounds were already really heavy.</p>
 <p>However, even with these wounds, it was a powerful dragon species, an immortal rank dragon. Getting killed by all the light spears released by the Light Emperor, how taunting was this? Yet, how shocking and terrifying as well!</p>
 <p>Death and dragon blood permeated the air.</p>
 <p>Two immortal rank experts were instantly killed, leaving only the remaining five people with an increasing fear of death finally arising in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Maybe, they should have chosen to run away at first sight, instead of arrogantly gathering everyone in hopes of fighting this black and white devil man!</p>
 <p>Its power and cruelty became coldness that pierced deeply into the bones of the remaining five people!</p>
