He let the Sacred Holy Realm’s Soul Teachers help him heal his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wounds on his bodies weren’t anything serious to Chu Mu; rather, his depleted soul power was the main problem. When Chu Mu’s mind slowly relaxed and after he was healed, he unconsciously fell into a sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu had only entered into a light sleep when he sensed someone walk next to him, his eyes gradually opened.</span></p>

It happened to be Old Soul Teacher De and Palace Lord Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Soul Teacher De was a famous old urchin from Soul Palace. He had never been as dignified as the other Soul Palace elders. When he saw Chu Mu lying on the stretcher, his small eyes opened much wider, and he didn’t say anything for a while out of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Soul Teacher De naturally didn’t believe that Chu Mu had entered Sacred Holy Region. Just now, from the holy guards, he had received the explanation that this fellow had not only finished the realm breakthrough round, but had also brought back a Ghost Spider Flower Demon, which was one even higher level of difficulty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A third grade member challenging the first grade honor was enough to make these elderly generation people stroke their beards and sigh in pity: yet another young person who is going to send himself to his death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, at the end of the day, this young man who had been essentially determined to enter hell had completed the mission that even first grade honor experts would not be able to complete. This was too inconceivable!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, are you still concealing some powerful soul pet? A tenth phase monarch?!!” the old Soul Teacher immediately stared at Chu Mu as he asked him a question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu shook his head and explained: “I’ve spent a long time training in the wild, and to a certain extent can freely traverse bewildering worlds that are several ranks higher than me. This time, my luck was pretty good, and I encountered the Ghost Spider Flower Demon shortly after entering.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if it’s at the edge of the Sacred Holy Region, if one doesn’t have one or two tenth phase monarchs, then one doesn’t have the qualifications to even attack. Could it be that this Ghost Spider Flower Demon delivered itself into your soul capture ring?” the old Soul Teacher was still a bit unconvinced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a hunting trick. There are times that one doesn’t have to attack in order to capture a soul pet. In truth, the Sacred Holy Region is very dangerous. In the past, I was able to freely travel around ninth rank bewildering worlds and could even enter Kingdom Lord territories if I didn’t fight. However, in Sacred Holy Region, I suffered from attacks; otherwise, I wouldn’t have crawled back in this state.” bitterly laughed Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back when Chu Mu had entered the forbidden region’s Blue Galactic Demon Emperor’s demon home, Chu Mu had been very unobstructed; however, the Sacred Holy Region’s difficulty level was clearly much higher than that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old De, don’t bother asking. Help heal him and his soul pets.” Palace Lord Yu timely stopped Old Soul Teacher De’s interrogation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was then that Old De finally reacted. He glared at Chu Mu and said: “I’ll heal you first. Then after a short rest, I’ll squeeze the information out of you. This old man doesn’t believe that I can’t figure you out! Don’t bother going anywhere else today. Lie here and sleep for a day. Your soul power is depleted beyond shambles… I’ve never seen a young man who disregards his own life more than you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was helpless. It seemed that this Old Soul Teacher De hadn’t finished with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then again, Old Soul Teacher De’s edginess wasn’t faultless. Sacred Holy Region was inherently opened practically only to middle generation and elder generation people. Moreover, if one’s strength hadn’t reached a certain level, even the edge of the region couldn’t be entered. It was very hard to convince Old Soul Teacher De that a third grade expert had obtained a Ghost Spirit Flower Demon from there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chu Mu had returned, it happened to be the tenth day of the second round. Old Spirit Master De was the main judge for Chu Mu in this round, so he quickly reported Chu Mu’s name to the competition authority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competition authority would specially have a group of people rank the difficulty of the realm breakthrough missions. On the eleventh day of the second realm, the Tianxia Realm would be published.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

This scene would appear once every six years while also lasting for a long period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the plaza, numerous expectant faces and invigorated gazes could be scene. Of these people. Many of them had travelled a long way in order to imprint their names on this enormous stone ranking of honor. Even if they appeared once on there, they would be able to honorably return to their homeland.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Tianxia Ranking was limited in quota. With expectation came joy, but also came disappointment and frustration. It was frequently possible to visibly sense how large the waves of emotions were in the competitors just from looking at their face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s strange, why did the very well-regarded in the first realm Soul Palace Chu Chen not appear?” a few people who didn’t have hope began to comment. A majority of these people who had no hope came to look for the young experts they revered in hopes that they would be able to obtain the highest honor that belonged to them. In this manner, these soul pet trainers would be able to feel a bit of happiness. It was essentially a tide of chasing after and worshipping experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was a third grade expert, and his performance had been extremely prominent in the second grade. Due to his fight with Shen Yicheng, he already had many supporters. Thus, during this honor challenge, Chu Mu received attention from even more people. There were therefore several people who Chu Mu was unfamiliar with in Tianxia City who had continuously paid attention to his competition outcome. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve searched through the whole thing but can’t find him. Could he have lost?” although there were many people on the second grade, even after carefully searching through, his name really couldn’t be found.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s a high chance of him hiding his strength. I estimate he only successfully broke through the realm.” said someone in defense of Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As everyone was discussing Chu Mu, Ye Qingzi who was standing in the crowd had an unsightly expression...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tianxia Rankings had already been published, but Chu Mu had yet to return. Ye Qingzi didn’t even see his name. She stared with a somber expression at the ranking, but didn’t bother finding her own name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You obtained third place which fortunately has a 200 million honor reward.” Ye Wansheng quickly found Ye Qingzi’s name and told her about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Ye Qingzi had been in Li City, her strength wasn’t much weaker than Chu Mu’s. Chu Mu was fighting those stronger than him by advancing a grade, but Ye Qingzi and Ye Wansheng were also doing the same in order to obtain the second grade’s honor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, even despite obtaining third place, Ye Qingzi had hidden a portion of her strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Wansheng turned his head and saw that Ye Qingzi wasn’t saying anything. He consoled her by saying: “Nothing happened to him. He happens to be the so-called Western Kingdom’s Prison Island King, and his training skills in the wild are extremely strong. The Sacred Holy Region is dangerous but if he doesn’t act rashly, he should be able to crawl his way back out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Truthfully, Ye Qingzi believed as well that Chu Mu would be able to return; after all, she knew his strength wasn’t as it seemed on the surface. Especially his half devil transformation; at least when a crisis came, he would be able to escape by using the half devil transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she hadn’t gotten any news of Chu Mu yet and her heart was still uneasy. This emotion had mysteriously become extremely intense as if her brain was worried about that one in a million chance; yet, this one in a million chance was already capable of affecting her emotions at all times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huh, that’s strange. Does Soul Palace have a second person named Chu Chen?” at this time, an astonished voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There should only be one. Why’d you ask that?”&nbsp;</span></p>

When those that were focused on the first grade abruptly discovered that Soul Palace’s Chu Chen had his name profoundly imprinted on the hunting realm’s honor ranking, sounds of doubt and astonishment rang out.</span></p>

Soul Palace’s Chu Chen obtained the highest honor of the second grade in first realm’s beast fighting realm and obtained the 39th place of the first grade in the second realm’s hunting realm! If you don’t believe this to be the truth, please do not wantonly spread false rumors. If this happens another time, then the competition authorities will deliver punishment!” with great dignity, the Tianxia Competition Authorities announced the results on the Tianxia Rankings.</span></p>
