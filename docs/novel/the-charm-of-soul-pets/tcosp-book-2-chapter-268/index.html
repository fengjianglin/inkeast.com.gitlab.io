 <p><strong>Chapter 268: Corpse Diagram, Corpse-Like Decay</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Seventh phase eighth stage commander rank soul pet - Evil Bone Devil Spider. Its speed completely outshone the clumsy Sturdy Rock Guard. Very quickly, this eight legged half beast half demon cast its strange technique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The symbol that symbolized death on its back glowed with a strange light. A ball of deathly aura surrounded it, bringing out its deathly nature even further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the Evil Bone Devil Spider jumped up, extending its body and eight bony legs towards Mo Xie!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its body completely stretched out in mid air. At the same time, the ball of deathly aura projected an image into the air, the exact image of death that was imprinted on its back. When its bony body fell, it felt as if this scary devil spider was stepping on a diagram of death, as it pounced towards the living!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, this is a corpse type technique. From now on, don’t let your little fox touch it, or else, all its live skin will immediately decay, and if the entire diagram shrouded you, then even the flesh within the skin will become corpse-like, losing all its life force!” Old Li’s voice floated into Chu Mu’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu had just learned of the terrifying nature of this Evil Bone Devil Spider’s technique, so he decisively let Mo Xie cast her Nine Tail Confuse!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her nine tails opened up like clouds, floating slowly. As they did this, Mo Xie’s body had already appeared twenty meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Tail Confuse’s illusionous tail curls were very soft, as if it twere running water. Even if it suffered a tremendously powerful attack, it wouldn’t cause any harm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what made Chu Mu very confused was, when Mo Xie cast Nine Tail Confuse to dodge the Evil Bone Devil Spider’s Corpse Diagram, one of Mo Xie’s tails seemed to have touched the edge of the corpse diagram. Her normally fluffy silver fur actually immediately started falling off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frightening power of corpse type energy quickly spread and soon, Mo Xie’s entire tail’s lower end was furless, and seemed completely grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve said not to let it even touch!” Old Li screamed at Chu Mu’s mental world loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also Chu Mu’s first time dealing with a soul pet of corpse type, so he immediately told Mo Xie to back further away as his brain worked swiftly, thinking of a counter strategy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A corpse type is quite scared of light type soul pets. Because they don’t have blood in them, your little fox’s Blood Flames are very hard to make use of. Normal flames also don’t work well on them.” Old Li’s voice continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu furrowed his brow, not knowing what to do with Yu He’s corpse type soul pet at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Yu He, seeing Chu Mu’s Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox showing signs of retreat, had a smug smile slowly float onto his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He knew that the Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox was very quick. If he truly wanted to attack it, it would probably be very difficult. Taking this opportunity where Mo Xie backed off, he commanded his Evil Bone Devil Spider to directly leap towards Chu Mu’s Devil Tree Battle Soldier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fight between the Devil Tree Battle Soldier and the Hundred Tree Female Demon had already lasted a long time. The Hundred Tree Female Demon’s attack strength and restrictive abilities were clearly much stronger than the Devil Tree Battle Soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s defense and power caused a great headache for the fragile Hundred Tree Female Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very beginning, because of the appearance of the Wood Finger Prison, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier had created a constant barrage of wood type techniques, forcing the Hundred Tree Female Demon to constantly hide to dodge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, the Hundred Tree Female Demon’s advantage of four stages slowly showed itself. Under the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s fierce attacks, it slowly found back the balance of the battle, and with its powerful restrictive vines, it controlled the Devil Tree Battle Soldier, giving the Devil Tree Battle Soldier many wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only with its body wounded could the importance of Life Force Absorb be shown. In the constant process of fighting, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier constantly absorbed the life force of the opponent, using Life Force Absorb, to replenish its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Constantly remaining at a peak status, yet rendering the opponent weakened due to the life force loss, every time the Devil Tree Battle Soldier used it, it gained a greater advantage, completely suppressing the powerful Hundred Tree Female Demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In every battle, a soul pet trainer had to care for all of his soul pets. Before, when Yu He found that Chu Mu’s Devil Tree Battle Soldier had Bloodsuck, his face went dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One had to know that, just two months back, this Devil Tree Battle Soldier of Chu Mu’s was just a bundle of sticks, something that his Hundred Tree Female Demon could easily defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, in such a short time, not only did Chu Mu raise its phase to seventh, he even strengthened its wood type to near monarch. The craziest thing was, he even granted his Devil Tree Battle Soldier the Bloodsuck technique. This Devil Tree Battle Soldier was virtually invincible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He felt that his Hundred Tree Wood Demon was no longer the match for this Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s match, so he decisively let the Evil Bone Devil Spider come to the battlefield over there to help!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Devil Tree Battle Soldier couldn’t possibly dodge like the Royal Flame Nine Tail Inferno Fox, and Yu He precisely wanted to exploit this. As long as the Evil Bone Devil Spider could near the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s body, Yu He could make Chu Mu’s annoying Devil Tree Battle Soldier into a pile of dead wood instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Devil Tree, careful.” Chu Mu decisively changed his battle tactic, letting Mo Xie throw fire type techniques from afar to suppress the Hundred Tree Female Demon, and not letting it interfere with the Devil Tree Battle Soldier, thus letting the Devil Tree Battle Soldier fight the Evil Bone Devil Spider.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter if it’s a powerful beast type or a quick demon type, in front of a wood type soul pet, its powerful attacks or swift dodges were rarely useful. This because to real wood type soul pets, within fifty meters of them, there was always wood type soul pet weapons and traps ready. If the beast type and demon type soul pets couldn’t near the wood type soul pet’s body, they would definitely be beaten to a pulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He clearly recognized this, so he didn’t directly let the Evil Bone Devil Spider attack the Devil Tree Battle Soldier directly, but instead let it, as a bug type soul pet, use its control of the ground to burrow into the ground and disappear into this moist room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Devil Tree Battle Soldier also very preemptively rooted itself into the ground, preventing the Evil Bone Devil Spider from crawling straight to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Mu himself also let out his soul remembrance, wanting to lock onto his Evil Bone Devil Spider. However, it clearly had casted some technique that could avoid even Chu Mu’s soul master level soul remembrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Chu Mu being somewhat helpless Yu He smiled coldly, while his eyes unwittingly glanced upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right above Yu He, which was above the Devil Tree Battle Soldier, darkness shrouded the room. Yet within the darkness, a thin black line flashed with a deadly glint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the end of the black silk, a bony white spider silently slid down, slowly nearing the Devil Tree Battle Soldier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, this corpse-like devil snapped its silk and pounced straight towards the Devil Tree Battle Soldier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Devil Tree Battle Soldier couldn’t possibly dodge, causing its upper body to almost be completely covered by the eight legs of the Evil Bone Devil Spider. Its terrifying corpse diagram started to melt away at the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s lively body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s green skin immediately became a petrified wood like grey. The frightening corpse diagram’s effects quickly deadened the outer Devil Wood Armor layer. As the Devil Tree Battle Soldier struggled, it fell down around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Corpse Diagram rotted the skin, it started seeping further into the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s body. The most important organs were already starting to show signs of grey…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Mu’s Devil Tree Battle Soldier was completely controlled, Yu He let out an even more smug smile. Every fight, what Yu He loved the most was to see a lively body slowly turn grey under the torment of his Evil Bone Devil Spider, before finally become a lifeless corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wood Type soul pets’ territorial nature was the strongest. On this, Chu Mu’s Devil Tree Battle Soldier did very well. But, Yu He’s Evil Bone Devil Spider was indeed strange. Once it completely tangled onto the Devil Tree Battle Soldier, it could no longer continue fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He smiled and specially looked at Chu Mu. As long as Chu Mu started a chant, Yu He would, without hesitation, interrupt Chu Mu, not giving him a chance to retract his soul pet or save his Devil Tree Battle Soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although, what made Yu He feel strange was, Chu Mu didn’t even seem to want to do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, from the very beginning of this fight, other than chanting a summoning incantation, Chu Mu had not used a single soul technique, even now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, in the dark, Yu He noticed that there was a confident smile on Chu Mu’s face. Yu He could feel that Chu Mu gave a command to his Devil Tree Battle Soldier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He had a bad feeling already, quickly turning to look at his Evil Bone Devil Spider.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet at this moment, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s body suddenly sprouted a few unbelievably sharp wood spikes. These wood spikes were very piercing. Even the Evil Bone Devil Spider’s bony body was punctured in multiple places!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu He was dazed, not expecting the Devil Tree Battle Soldier to still be able to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hengheng, lets see who’s soul pet dies first!!” Yu He bit down and didn’t let his Evil Bone Devil Spider give up its corpse technique!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effects of death have already entered the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s inner body. With just a few more moments, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s innards will all become corpse-like, making it completely dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, corpse type soul pets were known to be unkillable. No matter how heavy of an injury, it wouldn’t die. When both attacked simultaneously, Yu He was clear of who would win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, you would die.” Chu Mu said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Chu Mu immediately sent a command to his Devil Tree Battle Soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Absorb!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s wood spikes were already burrowed into the Evil Bone Devil Spider’s body. This way, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier could rampantly absorb the Evil Bone Devil Spider’s life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dumbass, don’t you know that corpse type soul pets don’t have blood to suck?” Yu He saw that Chu Mu wanted his Devil Tree Battle Soldier to use an absorbing technique and immediately laughed out loud, his face full of mocking for Chu Mu’s obvious blind spot in knowledge.</span></p>
