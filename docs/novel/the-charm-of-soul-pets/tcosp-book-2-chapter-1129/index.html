 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. He approximately understood the meaning of Lan Rao’s words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t have anything else to say, you can go back.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao gave a bow and said: “King Chu, if you make a decision, you can come find me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu called over a holy guard, and had him bring Lan Rao to the guest courtyards, letting her choose a place to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Polite actions should be returned by polite actions. Chu Mu couldn’t be bothered to haggle with these people from beyond the Dark Sky Ocean World. Since they had come to protect this place, there was no harm in leaving them here. It could be considered adding a bit of fighting strength to Wanxiang Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Lan Rao left, Chu Mu chanted an incantation, summoning Yu Sha in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lan Rao had been speaking just now, Chu Mu had undone the first soul restriction. After summoning her, he asked: “Is what she said true?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Yu Sha nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After two years of training, this arrogant and haughty queen had already somewhat realized that she would not be able to free herself from Chu Mu’s hands in the short-term. Therefore, she was much more obedient that originally. Normally, she would answer anything Chu Mu asked her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu obviously knew that with this woman’s character, she would never be completely obedient. At least whatever she was scheming, Chu Mu had an approximate understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In a war between millions, Wanxiang Realm will definitely lose. Is there no other way?” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Cloud Region has the power to revoke this and choose another method of fighting. A war between millions is only one method. Another method is to have the owners of the territory fight it out. You would then have to defeat the last first rank leader directly subordinate to the territory.” responded Yu Sha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who was the last first rank leader of Cloud Realm?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know.” said Yu Sha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Yu Sha had assumed the Empress Concubine position, she had practically already come to know everything about Cloud Region. She should know who the leader was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Sha glanced at Chu Mu. Seeing that this fellow was looking suspiciously at her, she sneered: “How could I remember such a person’s name?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then what is his strength like?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know.” Yu Sha continued to respond expressionlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you can return.” Chu Mu chanted an incantation, wanting to throw her back to her soul pet space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment she heard she was going to be thrown back, Yu Sha immediately grew anxious. Her obstinate eyes carried a trace of pleading, as if she wanted to say something but was hesitating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine. If you have something to say, then say it.” Chu Mu showed a rare instance of kindness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give me three days to cultivate.” hastily said Yu Sha. Just like how Chu Mu’s strength came from the unity of his soul remembrance and the White Nightmare’s strength, Yu Sha’s strength came from the unity of her soul remembrance and the Evil Good Flower Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was unexpected was that after two years of devil flame burning, her mental force had already entered the dominator rank. If she broke through this time, her strength would greatly increase again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think I will give you the time?” Chu Mu felt this was laughable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If her strength increased, there was a chance she could free herself from his binds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your… your strength increases so slow!” Yu Sha said, somewhat vexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t pay any heed to Yu Sha’s transformation from a gentle and soft low voice to a humiliated rage. He slowly said: “It’s almost as if my soul pet trainer talent was stolen away by you, eh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It wasn’t!” Yu Sha’s response was very fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Li had already told him that Liu Binglan was a higher ranked human. Thus, as her son, Chu Mu should have inherited her talent that would allow him to easily reach the spirit emperor rank without even cultivating. However, Chu Mu hadn’t and Liu Binglan had told him that his talent could have been stolen by the defector woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for how to steal it back, Chu Mu was currently thinking about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Sha realized that she was in trouble. Chu Mu’s talent was still extremely important to her strength increase. If it was taken back, it would take a long time for her Evil Good Flower Queen to grow to the tenth phase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that detestable old racoon man in existence, Yu Sha really couldn’t be certain if that rotten old man would be able to find a way to steal back the talent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a bit flustered and hastily said: “Talent no longer has any meaning at your rank. I can help you enter the spirit dominator rank…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How?” Chu Mu indeed was thinking of how to enter the spirit dominator rank. Otherwise, aside from Mo Xie who had undergone a species mutation, it would be hard for his other soul pets to rise in rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need the help of a few xuan items. These xuan items definitely won’t be found in Wanxiang Realm or Tianxia Realm. Aren’t you planning on going to Cloud Realm? I know a few places with xuan items. I can help you enter the spirit dominator rank.” said Yu Sha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Sha’s current tone was much more pleasant to the ears. It was soft and silky, making the listener feel very comfortable. It was like she was singing, and the nearby holy guards couldn’t help but poking their heads in. They were silently wondering why another woman had suddenly appeared next to King Chu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was able to approximately differentiate whether this woman was speaking the truth or lies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Chu Mu had already asked Old Li already whether he could take back his talent. Old Li had told him he didn’t know of any effective methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Interestingly, Chu Mu’s simple mentioning of it, and this woman had confessed it herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Talent indeed was useless at Chu Mu’s current rank. The most important thing for him was to enter the spirit dominator rank. Once he did so and frantically increased his soul pets’ strengths, his soul remembrance would naturally increase as well. If Yu Sha was right about there being a method for him to enter the spirit dominator rank, this was obviously a good thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were speaking, Prince Chao and Mu Qingyi walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them saw Yu Sha who was adjacent to Chu Mu and showed slightly fearful expressions. However, thinking about it again, this woman was a prisoner, and there ostensibly was nothing to be afraid of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, I heard you were planning on travelling beyond Cloud Gate?” Prince Chao spoke first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, once Qingzi finishes concocting, we will leave.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You husband and wife couple are planning on continuing to travel the world, eh?” Prince Chao laughed, but suddenly realized Mu Qingyi was next to him. He secretly threw a glance at her, and hastily gave a hollow laugh to cover it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao’s words indeed put Mu Qingyi in an awkward spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi innately was dedicated to her pursuit of the soul pet path. When she came to know of outside worlds, she really wanted to travel them and train in higher ranked regions. Yet, when Prince Chao said Chu Mu and Qingzi were going to travel the world, how could she just butt in? It would be best if she didn’t intrude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the rumors were circulating that her relationship with Chu Mu wasn’t just normal, she could sense that Ye Qingzi was the only one in Chu Mu’s heart. If she were to join them, perhaps she would even break them apart. Her prideful heart wasn’t willing to do this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hesitating, Mu Qingyi felt that it was best to just travel alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news of King Mu being alive in Cloud Realm had given Mu Qingyi a direction. She was planning on first finding her great-grandfather. Perhaps her grandfather and other family members would be there as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm, you don’t plan on going together?” Chu Mu was a bit puzzled by Prince Chao’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao’s eyes lit up and he hastily said: “You’re planning on bringing us too?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prince Chao and Mu Qingyi had both already entered the dominator rank. If they wanted to rise another level, they would have to wanter to the outside world. Chu Mu was very certain that the two of them had a sense of impatience and longing for higher levels. If they didn’t travel to the outside world, Chu Mu would feel it was strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I was afraid you felt your strength was too different from ours, and didn’t want to bring us.” Prince Chao spoke back with a glib tongue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu bitterly laughed. Strength was something that could always be increased. The world beyond Cloud Gate was unfamiliar and bringing more people along would allow for more people who could look after each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qingyi, what about you?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it wasn’t just Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi travelling the world, she couldn’t consider it interfering with their relationship. Thus, she nodded her head. She felt that everyone going together was better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the three of them spoke, a holy guard brought Lan Rao in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did she come back?” Chu Mu was confused as he looked at Lan Rao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao had suddenly returned, because she felt she should tell King Chu about the option to choose a private fight of territory owners. Intentionally hiding it from him could end up backfiring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, Lan Rao hadn’t expected that Chu Mu would have someone next to him that had a rather clear understanding of the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Chu, just now I forgot to tell you that there’s a different method of fighting…” Lan Rao bowed again and looked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked first at Chu Mu then glanced at Prince Chao and Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao had seen Prince Chao and Mu Qingyi before and as a woman, she subconsciously compared herself with Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After, her gaze fell on Empress Concubine Yu Sha who was standing diagonally behind Chu Mu. Suddenly, the smile on her face froze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did there really exist such a beautiful woman in this world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao’s eyes momentarily went absent-minded before quickly diverting her gaze. In the past when she encountered women with top tier looks and temperament, she would naturally compare herself. This was perhaps something that innately happened for most women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in front of this woman who was wearing blue colored flower petal clothing, she suddenly felt self-ashamed. The perfect and flawless complexion made it impossible for women to even resist. The incorporeal pride and noble aura was like a flower lotus that blossomed atop an ice mountain; it was both far and unattainable!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Rao found it hard to believe that such an outstanding celestial woman would exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even more shocking was that this woman was docilely standing next to King Chu, the man she wanted to charm. Yet, King Chu remained unmoved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already know.” Chu Mu stopped Lan Rao from continuing and said: “In a little bit I’m going to leave this place. If something unexpected happens, I hope that Young Lady Lan will promptly lend a hand.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course… of course. We came here to protect this territory.” a new smile rose on Lan Rao’s face. “Then… then Lan Rao will excuse herself first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the slowly leaving Lan Rao, Prince Chao threw a glance at Empress Concubine Yu Sha who was standing next to Chu Mu, looking very obedient. He quietly laughed and said: “That woman’s ego seems to have been injured.”&nbsp;</span></p>
