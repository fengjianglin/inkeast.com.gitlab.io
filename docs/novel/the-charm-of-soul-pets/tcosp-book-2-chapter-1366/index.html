 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the third Broken Limb Rebirth, Zhan Ye’s strength was raised up by another level and it advanced into the Paragon Dominator rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a direct frontal confrontation, Heaven Eye Toxin Beast no longer held the advantage. Meanwhile, Zhan Ye ignored any attacks coming from the other soul pets by relying solely on its tenacious life force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye was not hoping that it could kill Heaven Eye Toxin Beast in such a situation. However, if Zhan Ye were to turn to defense, it would definitely be exhausted by being constantly surrounded in such a situation. Hence, it went into full offensive right from the start, all to deal more damage to the Heaven Eye Toxin Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With its exuberant life force supporting it, it reaped even more profit by going on full offensive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was not worried about Zhan Ye, his attention was instead focused on the Little Hidden Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon had also encountered a powerful opponent for itself, it was He Zhen’s Snow Feather Devil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Feather Devil’s race was also similarly at the Paragon Emperor rank, and a little higher than the Little Hidden Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon did not possess an exuberant life force like Zhan Ye did. Facing a stronger opponent, Little Hidden Dragon would definitely not choose a frontal confrontation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghost property of the Little Hidden Dragon affected its strategy. It had been dodging the Snow Feather Devil’s pursuit and was focusing its attacks on those weaker soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its objective was clearly to increase its own power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon was currently at the high class Dominator rank. By relying on its three main properties, it had managed to confront the peak and the Paragon Dominator rank soul pets. The souls that it had devoured had already reached ninety percent, just another ten percent and the Little Hidden Dragon’s subordinate soul —— Spectral Dragon could advance to the peak Dominator rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rank was extremely important for the Little Hidden Dragon. Otherwise, it would be almost impossible for it to fight against the Snow Feather Devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had already shared his Other Pupils effect with the Little Hidden Dragon and was constantly paying attention to it while also instructing it on what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, another high class Dominator rank soul pet showed an opening and Little Hidden Dragon grasped the chance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Little Hidden Dragon devoured the soul of that high class Dominator rank water type Fairy. The soul had immediately flowed into the underworld river and had become a part of the Little Hidden Dragon’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Three more,” Chu Mu scanned his surroundings to find more prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon was facing a similar number of enemies. Those middle class Dominator rank soul pets had learned their lesson and were staying far away while they casted their techniques. They did not give the Little Hidden Dragon any chance to devour their souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the high class Dominator rank soul pets were packed together. Little Hidden Dragon would have had to pay a big price to kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In accordance with the usual tactic, Little Hidden Dragon continued to dash around the Hovering Mountains, while looking for a chance to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghost type creatures had always been the most troublesome types to deal with. Originally, most ghost type creatures did not possess any powerful attacks, but this Spectral Hidden Dragon possessed really powerful explosive strength. If the normal peak Dominator rank soul pets were not at guard, they could easily be killed by it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had also realized that just like what Old Li had told him, the advantage of having multiple properties would become even greater at a higher rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn, let’s see how you escape from me this time!” He Zhen had finally lost his patience. He began chanting an incantation to summon an Aerial Listening Demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Aerial Listening Demons were famous as seeker soul pets. Any sort of movement would not be able to escape their hearing. Furthermore, they had a powerful mental restriction ability. They were definitely the bane of all ghost type creatures!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aerial Listening Demon was causing great trouble to the Little Hidden Dragon the moment it appeared on the battlefield. The Little Hidden Dragon had suffered minor injuries under the joint attack of the Snow Feather Devil and other soul pets after getting mentally restricted by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Aerial Listening Demon had not reached Paragon Dominator rank, but it was not far from it. Its mental techniques were a fatal threat to the Little Hidden Dragon. Let alone devouring souls, the Little Hidden Dragon was already having a hard time escaping from the pursuit of the other soul pets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dead Dream!” Chu Mu chanted an incantation to summon Dead Dream so that it could join the battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A purplish black lightning totem suddenly appeared. Dead Dream with its sixteen wings was charged with powerful lightning. The entire Hovering Mountain Battlefield was instantly shrouded by several thunder clouds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying pressure released from the thunder clouds had almost crushed the entire Hovering Mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bewitching black Phoenix body, elegant sixteen feathered wings, black night and a roaring thunder crossed. The soaring Fairy Butterfly was the agent of death, it was elegant, chilling, and dangerous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving the affection of Ning Maner, Dead Dream’s strength had grown explosively in a short span of time. Other than the fact that it had less battle experience, its strength was not any inferior to Night when Night was the yellow spring..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Night was still the yellow spring, it was truly the strongest Dominator. Those normal peak Dominators were no match against it. It still stood a chance against opponents that were close to the Immortal rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dead Lightning, not only did it contain the rampaging destructive property of the lightning type, but it also possessed the coldness and the creepiness of darkness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every technique used by Dead Dream caused the other challengers to panic. What the spectators saw was at most those challengers running away like scattered sand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Dead Dream’s support, the Little Hidden Dragon’s situation was instantly reversed. It had also cleverly devoured a peak Dominator rank soul pet’s soul within the commotion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After devouring that soul, the Little Hidden Dragon started glowing and the ghost dragon’s soul immediately evolved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ughuuu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon had instantly become stronger than before, even its wounds had rapidly started healing. It roared in excitement and stared at the Snow Feather Devil with a sneer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Aerial Listening Demon was being chased around by Dead Dream. So, Snow Feather Devil was the only enemy that Little Hidden Dragon had to crush. It had been chased around by the Snow Feather Devil just a moment ago, so it was feeling quite frustrated. Now, it was time to start a merciless counterattack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You actually dare to come back, die!” sneered He Zhen after he saw the Little Hidden Dragon flying towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the next moment, He Zhen’s sneer was frozen in place. His Snow Feather Devil was actually knocked away by the Little Hidden Dragon’s dragon horn in a frontal clash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Zhen watched his injured Snow Feather Devil and his mind was filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Spectral Hidden Dragon is clearly weaker than my Snow Feather Devil, so how can it injure my Snow Feather Devil?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong?” asked Han Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also don’t know,” He Zhen was becoming anxious. He took a glance at Han Qi’s Heaven Eye Toxin Beast and spoke, “You still haven’t finished it off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi’s mouth twitched slightly. That bastard possessed the Broken Limb Rebirth, it would immediately recover after getting heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi had already summoned his second soul pet. His Heaven Eye Toxin Beast was slowly getting pushed back by Zhan Ye. He had no choice but to summon another soul pet to support it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Han Qi had summoned his second soul pet earlier, then Zhan Ye would have been greatly suppressed and would have been unable to slowly gain strength through the Brave Stinging Heart. Unfortunately, Han Qi had missed the best timing to suppress it. After going through three rebirths, it was time for Zhan Ye to display its full strength. And its strength had grown much stronger after three rebirths!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Zhan Ye had used the Broken Limb Rebirth for the fourth time, Han Qi had finally realized that something was amiss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient Power Awakening appeared again. Along with the Brave Stinging Heart, Zhan Ye’s strength leaped one step higher, a level stronger than the Paragon Dominator rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One level higher meant that it could hold its ground in the 1 vs 2. At the same time, the power of the ancient tattoos on Zhan Ye’s body were also getting stronger along with Zhan Ye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the power of the ancient tattoos and the Ancient Beast Soul had gathered on Zhan Ye’s claws, the explosive strength was enough to deter even the Paragon Dominator rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp black claws drew a long arc. As it cut apart a Hovering Mountain, it had also severed the huge centipede!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge centipede was an insect type creature and it possessed incredible recovery ability. The damage that Zhan Ye dealt to it initially did not really affect its fighting strength later on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye had been trying to find a chance to finish it off. If one could not kill an insect type creature quickly, then it would just come back in full strength soon again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After going through the fourth Broken Limb Rebirth, the huge centipede could no longer escape since Zhan Ye could easily kill the huge centipede if it wanted to. It didn't matter even if Han Qi’s two Paragon Emperors interfered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge centipede was bisected into two along with the Hovering Mountain. Green body fluids sprayed into the sky. A thick stench lingered in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge corpse fell down and that moment shocked the entire venue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From just being slightly stronger than the huge centipede to instantly killing it, this rise in power could not be any more obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, the aura that it was exuding also indicated that the two Paragon Dominator ranks that Han Qi had summoned might not be able to easily defeat it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are there any more soul pets? Just summon them together already,” Chu Mu looked at Han Qi from far away, his gaze filled with mockery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fighting two Paragon Dominator ranks simultaneously was still not enough to satisfy Zhan Ye’s desire for battle. As for the other challengers, Zhan Ye fundamentally chose to ignore them all. It already had enough strength to kill a normal peak Dominator rank instantly, was there any meaning to the presence of those high class or middle class Dominator rank soul pets here? Even if a dozen of them unleashed their techniques simultaneously, it meant next to nothing before Zhan Ye’s life force. If they had the guts to do that, Zhan Ye would not mind wasting some time to reap all of their lives!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, those challengers were all stunned by the large number of Paragon Dominator rank soul pets appearing. Their weak soul pets could do nothing to affect the current battle. It was not worth it to waste the lives of their soul pets for it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If your Zhan Ye Mo Ye only amounts to this, then it won’t be far from death!” cursed Han Qi angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Qi was born in a small household. He was able to enter a big household due to his talents. The thing that he hated the most was the disdain and mockery from others!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Han Qi begin chanting, Chu Mu revealed a big smile instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far from death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Ye has always been tip toeing on the edge of death. However, each time the death god has hovered above its dying body, it would leave frustratingly in the end after waiting for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There are two more Broken Limb Rebirths, even I myself cannot estimate how much stronger Zhan Ye will become after using them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whenever your own strength could not be estimated, it was natural to measure it through the enemy. Honestly speaking, Chu Mu was really afraid that Han Qi would only amount to that much. However, seeing that Han Qi still had more soul pets to summon, and seemingly very strong ones at that, Chu Mu was immediately relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looks like today will be Zhan Ye’s stage!</span></p>
