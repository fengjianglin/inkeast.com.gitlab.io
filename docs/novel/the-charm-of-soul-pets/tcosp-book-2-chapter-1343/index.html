They wanted us to participate in the Territory Conference that happens once every 10 years. When the time comes, the city lords of the various large border cities, the owners of independent territories, the leaders of large factions as well as some extremely famous people will participate. Our New Moon Land has just become independent, and in the past has never participated in this conference. I’m not sure what is going to be discussed there.” said Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s go.” Chu Mu was still thinking about Chu Tianmang, and didn’t really pay attention o what Liu Binglan was saying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you about to go to Zhengming Main City?” asked Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want me to participate in this conference?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan shook her head and said: “I know that you don’t like this stuff. Of course I’ll go personally. What’s the matter? You seem unhappy that your mother is making a rare trip with you? Are you afraid that I’ll get in your way?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu finally realized what was going on and hastily put on a smile: “How could that be? I’m extremely honored.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s better.” said Liu Binglan with a humph.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps dad will appear with you going.” Chu Mu felt that there was a high chance of this happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered Chu Tianmang as someone who cared a lot about feelings. At least before he had become an adult, Chu Mu didn’t ever see him with another woman. And each time Liu Binglan appeared, his emotions would be complicatedly helpless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s an arrogant man. Perhaps he’s already given you many younger brothers and sisters in the outside already. Him refusing to see us is only normal.” coldly harrumphed Liu Binglan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Chu Mu didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, the grudge Liu Binglan had towards Chu Tianmang was very deep.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the start, the husband and wife relationship between Liu Binglan and Chu Tianmang was acrimonious. The two each had their own thoughts, and were very stubborn people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Adding on the fact Chu Tianmang hadn’t shown himself for many years, this made the grudge that Liu Binglan had towards him become even greater. Even if he was too lazy to see her, why was he refusing to see his son? He had to know that Chu Mu had spent many years looking for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He could have some troubles.” Chu Mu felt that he had to speak up for his dad so as to leave some room for reconciliation between them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan didn’t want to talk about him any further and changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was even more helpless. He now understood why Liu Binglan’s face was always covered in coldness whenever he saw her when he was young: the coldness was for Chu Tianmang to see. However, the coldness had accidentally reached him, leaving an indescribable fear towards his mother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu silently thought to himself that he had to be extremely careful when he mentioned his dad to Liu Binglan in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After talking with Liu Binglan and setting a time of departure, Chu Mu returned to his room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to his room, Chu Mu was still thinking about Chu Tianmang. He didn’t understand why his dad was unwilling to show himself. Was there something restricting him? Could it be because of his Darkness Sect identity?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it didn’t matter if it was Divine Sect or Darkness Sect. This had nothing to do with Chu Mu, and he wouldn’t care if his dad had joined Darkness Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After thinking about it, Chu Mu still didn’t understand, so he just stopped thinking about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning his mind to Night, which had already entered the immortal rank and adding on his own powerful dual evil powers, he probably wouldn’t encounter much trouble going to Zhengming Main City this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After changing his clothes, Chu Mu didn’t even turn on the lights as he walked towards his bed and pulled over the blanket.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as he pulled, a soft cry suddenly rang out from next to him. He turned his head and saw a young woman with a graceful figure wearing translucent sleeping wear sleeping on his bed. Her sleek skin and alluring fragrance stunned Chu Mu for several seconds…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, what are you doing…” Ning Maner’s face was red from embarrassment as she softly spoke out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he looked at Ning Maner’s delicate and alluring appearance, Chu Mu didn’t know what to say for a while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just now he had been thinking about things. Although from the soul link he could feel that Ning Maner was nearby, he thought that she was in the room next door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I forgot that this was the place you used to sleep.” Chu Mu’s face went red, and he awkwardly turned his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This room indeed used to be Ning Maner’s room. But after she left, Ye Qingzi liked this room more so they moved here. Thus, Chu Mu’s room became this one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, this is Big Brother’s room. But Aunty Liu let me sleep here…” said Ning Maner. After finishing her words, Ning Maner immediately realized something, and her white and beautiful face was instantly dyed with red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sleep here. I’ll just go next door.” Chu Mu stood up. He felt that if he kept looking, something was going to happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman was no longer the girl of the past. Her entire body was emitting youthful charm. Not only did she have an attractive and graceful figure, but she also had a fairy-like face of pure beauty. If he didn’t keep his distance, Chu Mu, who had suppressed his desires for a few years, was now afraid that he would have evil thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, not long ago a very, very beautiful spectral sister flew in. She saw that I was changing and then flew out…” Ning Maner told Chu Mu about this just as he was leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Chu Mu was even more speechless. This misunderstanding just became even greater.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can feel that she’s still at Lake Pavilion,” said Ning Maner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, thanks.” Chu Mu closed the door. He wasn’t very sleepy, and went straight to Lake Pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu hadn’t spoken to Princess Jinrou since coming back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a lake in Soul Palace. At the center of the lake was a pavilion reached by crossing a wooden bridge. The pavilion was behind Liu Binglan’s Female Supreme Palace, and was normally her personal pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lake water was very clean, and it reflected the azure stars in the sky. From a distance, it looked like a star had fallen into the world. Only when the occasional drifting leaf landed on the lake, causing a faint ripple, would people realize that this was merely a reflection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next to the lake, a faint specter wearing a long white dress silently stood there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She carefully shifted her body towards the lake, and stared at the tranquil water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lake water was an ink-black color, with the stars in the sky dotted in. The only thing that wasn’t reflected was herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of bitterness and frustration appeared on her face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Jinrou didn’t know how long it had been since she had last seen what she looked like. After becoming a specter, she could pass through mirror worlds as she wished, but the mirror worlds were ultimately illusory. Her image didn’t exist in reality. Put differently, she didn’t exist in the real world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was currently standing nearby. He knew that she liked water and liked staring at the tranquility of water. But when he saw the bitterness and frustration flash on her face, Chu Mu had a painful feeling in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Chu Mu think of what Hai Qie had told him on the boat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jinrou.” Chu Mu walked up to the spectral princess, and called out to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I the same as those malicious spirits demanding vengeance for their grievances that are portrayed in books? Is my hair really long? Do I look like a monster? Are my eye sockets without eyeballs? Am I empty like a corpse…?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After becoming a specter, Princess Jinrou would rarely appear in front of strangers. She was afraid that everyone didn’t want to hurt her, and thus told her that even in her spectral state, she was very beautiful. She couldn’t actually see what she looked like, and didn’t know if what everyone said was true.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t think like that. You’re just as beautiful as before. You’re the most…” Chu Mu hesitated before ultimately saying, “You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou was stunned, and her water-like limpid eyes stared at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, she lowered her head and said: “There are some things that I don’t dare use my mind-reading abilities for. I’m afraid that once I know, it will make me feel even worse.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just read my mind. There are some things that I myself don’t even know the answer to or know how to say it,” said Chu Mu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou shook her head. Even if she knew the answer, what did it matter? She was pretty much a dead person already.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll help you find the Limbo Flower,” Chu Mu said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou didn’t respond. She just sat with Chu Mu next to the lake, staring at the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are you going next?” asked Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhengming Main City. How about you come with me?” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My father wants to take me to Zhengming Aerial Forest. The maps indicate that there is a Heaven Boundary Monument there,” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she mentioned the Heaven Boundary Monument, Chu Mu remembered the words Ning Maner had told him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou could understand the words on the Heaven Boundary Monument. If he wanted to uncover the Heaven Boundary Monument’s mystery, he needed her help. Thus, Chu Mu told her about what he knew of the Heaven Boundary Monuments.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monument Tear Individuals, Fake Monument Tear Individuals?” Princess Jinrou descended into thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the time Chu Mu had left, Princess Jinrou had explored New Moon Land’s two Heaven Boundary Monuments even further. She discovered a deeper layer of information that happened to match up with the Monument Tear Individuals Chu Mu just told her about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you read memories?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, but the person I read cannot resist this. Otherwise, it will deal a severe injury to my soul,” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I intentionally stayed at Lin City’s Heaven Boundary Monument for a long time so that I would be able to remember the words written on the Heaven Boundary Monument. You can use my memories to determine what was written on Lin City’s Heaven Boundary Monument.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou nodded her head. She extended a finger, and lightly placed it on his forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reading other peoples’ memories was a long process, and also expended a lot of mental energy. While she read his memories, she had Chu Mu write down the words she was saying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could control spatial energy, so he wrote down the words Princess Jinrou down in the air, forming a series of special symbols.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Mu couldn’t understand these special symbols.</span></p>
