The Dark Devil Buddhist possessed a specter body that looked like it was cloaked. Its two hands were dark red claws that had three sharp claw-edges. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its pair of legs didn’t need to stand on the ground as it was always floating half a meter above it. Its two eyes carried a slightly azure light and its gaze was terrifyingly sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Dark Devil Buddhist appeared, it disappeared like a specter in between two large trees. Next, Princess Jin Rou continued to talk to Chu Mu as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu knew that he didn’t need to do anything. He was shocked. The Dark Devil Buddhist Princess Jin Rou had summoned was a ninth phase fourth stage middle class monarch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Night Thunder Dream Beast had already reached the ninth phase first stage, but the difference in stages was equivalent to an entire level. In terms of rank, it was also lacking by a level. Even if it used its domain technique, it would not necessarily even be the Dark Devil Buddhist’s opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shua shua!!!!!”</span></p>

Obviously, the person following Chu Mu and Princes Jin Rou in the dark had been attacked by the Dark Devil Buddhist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu’s reaction was very fast. He instantly turned around and passed through the rows of fallen trees. He immediately saw that the Dark Devil Buddhist’s dark red claw was pointing at a man whose arm was bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was half lying down on the ground. Beside it was a demon, but it had easily been suppressed by a mental technique of Princess Jin Rou’s Dark Devil Buddhist. It could only fruitlessly struggle in place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man didn’t dare to chant an incantation because if he were to summon another soul pet, the Dark Devil Buddhist’s bloody claw would pierce his throat. Thus, in fear, he quickly approached Chu Mu and Princess Jin Rou who was only slightly slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I … I didn’t… I didn’t have any evil intentions…” the man’s face was pale as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu got a bit closer and sized up this man. He found that aside from the wound the Dark Devil Buddhist had ripped open on his arm, his waist also showed signs of injury. It seemed this wound had been there for a while now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” Chu Mu stood in front of him and coldly interrogated him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I am a Blue Kingdom person. My name is Liu Zhang and am a crossing world competitor.” said the man professedly called Liu Zhang as he held the wound on his arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Princess Jin Rou slowly walked over. She stood beside the Dark Devil Buddhist and looked at Chu Mu with a bit of curiosity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Zhang’s two eyes that carried fear quickly fell onto Princess Jin Rou. Slowly, the expression on his face changed, now carrying a bit of shock and complication.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Princess Jin Rou? Don’t tell me that you’re Princess Jin Rou?!” Liu Zhang’s expression was abnormally excited. He stared intensely at Princess Jin Rou, and a certain type of infatuation and appreciation could be seen on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? Have we met before?” Princess Jin Rou carefully examined this person who she seemed to not remember at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Before you entered Tianxia City, I had encountered trouble at the edge of a bewildering world and it was your subordinate who saved me. I was going to thank your subordinate, but she had me remember the favor in your name. In the past, I had always admired you but then I received your grace. Therefore, I had been very much hoping to say my thanks to you, but never had the chance. I never expected to see you here. This is truly too good.” Liu Zhang gratefully said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Princess Jin Rou seemed to remember that her subordinate had mentioned this to her. She didn’t have much to say as she said: “Deal with your wound first then tell me why you were following us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes yes.” Liu Zhang immediately nodded his head and hastily wrapped his wound. From his adept skill, he seemed to be a soul pet trainer that frequently trained in the wilderness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu continued to maintain his vigilance. At the very least, this Liu Zhang’s actions were very suspicious. This was because he had been continuously hiding his aura and his skills were very high. He was no mere casual. If it wasn’t because Chu Mu’s soul remembrance was higher than his, he would probably only discover his existence if he had launched a sneak attack on Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I really don’t have any ill intent. I noticed you two in the poison thorn belt up ahead. At that time, I didn’t know you two so I followed behind you guys. The truth is that I wanted to travel with you two, but I didn’t know what your strength was like.” said Liu Zhang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s with the wound on your waist?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is precisely what I just spoke about. I arrived here earlier than others, but the basin in front was extremely dangerous. I already entered once, but returned wounded. The most important thing is that I discovered a few people lying in ambush in the basin. Although my strength is far from many true second grade experts, my aura hiding abilities are extremely strong. When I entered the basin, I inadvertently discovered many corpses. I had originally thought it was the weaker competitors that had been attacked by the basin’s savage creatures when I eventually discovered a shocking secret! The people lying in ambush in the basin are specially here to kill us competitors!” as Liu Zhang spoke, his eyes were full of fear, “The wound on my body was rendered by them. I managed to flee and not long after saw you two. I came to both warn you and also because I wanted to travel with you. If I were to head into this place alone, those killers will definitely appear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu glanced at Princess Jin Rou and they both sunk into deep thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first thing Chu Mu considered wasn’t the killers hiding in the basin, but whether Liu Zhang’s words were believable or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second thing Chu Mu considered was the problem of the killers in the basin. If the killers really existed, who could they be? Were they competitors seeking to obtain honor for themselves and decided to massacre other competitors in the basin? Or did they have another objective?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Princess, what do you think?” Chu Mu used soul remembrance to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Liu Zhang’s words should be true. My subordinate mentioned this person to me. He is a famous soul pet trainer from Blue Kingdom who frequently trains in the wilderness. My subordinate tried to make him serve me and specially went to investigate news about him. This person is an honest person who has never entered any faction.” Princess Jin Rou knew the first thing to do was have Chu Mu acknowledge Liu Zhang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what do think about those killers?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Princes Jin Rou had a good understanding of the state of the various factions. Since there had appeared a group of killers in the Battle of the Realm who were intentionally killing competitors, there was definitely something hidden going on…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps. The killers of the competition authorities are probably not only the killer we determined earlier, but also a few others. They reached this place earlier in order to obstruct all of the competitors and then let the person they are escorting to reach the seventh realm’s honor unobstructed.” said Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu furrowed his brows. Upon reaching the last few realms, the teams created by trusted faction aids would appear. However, using the method of killing competition authorities and other competitors to obtain the benefits was too cruel. It was unknown which faction’s hidden experts would be so daring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember I told you before that the first thing to do in the bewildering world wasn’t to breakthrough the realm, but instead to search for one’s own teammates or find people you trusted?” Princess Jin Rou used soul remembrance to softly speak to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t go around, we can only kill our way through.” Chu Mu nodded his head.</span></p>
