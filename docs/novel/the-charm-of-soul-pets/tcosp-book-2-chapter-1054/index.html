 <p>In the curtain of rain, the outer city and the main avenue, as well as the streets branching off, were soaked in blood water. The conspicuous red color could be clearly seen by everyone on the execution stage.</p>
 <p>The rain struck their hopeless faces. Most of those dragged onto the execution stage were higher ups of the three great palaces. They knelt there, carrying the humiliation of defeat. In front of them was the dark curtain of rain, and when they lifted their heads, all they could see was the sharp and threatening executioner’s blade. They didn’t have much hope left.</p>
 <p>However, in the corner of their eyes were three people whom they watched walk forth along the main street from the outer city wall. They watched them face the army of over ten thousand without slowing down at all. When they saw the main street and its surroundings run red with blood, waves of shock broke out in their hearts!</p>
 <p>Their vision was getting hazier and hazier. Teng Lang, whose face was filled with rain and tears watched those three people, and felt like his throat had been blocked by something.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu, Prince Chao, Brother Ye…” Teng Lang couldn’t say anything because he didn’t know where these three people gathered the courage to face an entire army and all of Soul Alliance’s experts. The entire outer city was red as if it was burning with blood. This meant that they had an unwavering intent to fight!!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Senior Elder Xiao, the old hermit, and Elder Yang were also trapped on the execution stage. They looked with disbelief at the three people that slaughtered their way through the enemy’s camp in the heavy rain. They didn’t know whether to sigh at their attempt of the impossible or whether to admire their soul-shaking fighting intent!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Long long long long long~~~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the execution stage faintly trembled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The trembling seemed to grow closer and more powerful as the murky horizon seemed to grow closer!</p>
 <p>Everyone looked up and abruptly discovered that at the edge of the curtain of rain was a beast tide that had come out of nowhere!!</p>
 <p>The onslaught of the beast tide caused the earth to tremble. Even if they were very far away, the people on the execution stage could still feel the boundless and majestic aura!</p>
 <p>The violent wind and rain seemed so quiet and insignificant right now in the face of the roars and cries of ten thousand beasts that formed an intimidating storm that slowly swept over from the distance!!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This… this is…” Old Soul Teacher De and the other senior elders and elders were stunned again.</p>
 <p>They wanted to use their hands to wipe the rain off their faces, but their hands were bound. They could barely open their eyes and discern the hazy flag in the distance!!</p>
 <p>The flag that was fluttering didn’t have the insignia of Soul Palace’s Seven Diagram Saint Pets, Nightmare Palace’s Nightmare insignia or Soul Pet Palace’s crown. Instead, it was a golden flag with a splotch of fresh red blood in the shape of a bloody sword!</p>
 <p>This was a flag that had never been seen before, but everyone knew that it was the flag of the three great palaces. The blood red sword symbolized their resolution to fight till the end!!</p>
 <p>They had seen too many familiar people enter the city with their heads down and branches of the three great palace army being enlisted into Soul Alliance’s faction. Everyone on the execution stage felt both mentally and physically exhausted. However, when they saw this army and the flag, everyone felt their blood boil!!</p>
 <p>In this instant, they suddenly realized: that’s right, the war was still happening. It wouldn’t stop because they had been defeated, nor would it end because of the defectors! There were at least three people that dared face Soul Alliance’s army of a million and thousands of emperors. Behind them was moreover an army of high morale that followed the footsteps of these three people and slaughtered their way into Wanxiang City!!</p>
 <p>Their hearts and blood were ignited. When these hopeless and exhausted people saw this scene, they all wanted to free themselves from their binds, throw themselves into the white colored army and dye their bodies with the blood of their enemies!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are… are they coming to send themselves to death?!!” watching the grand three great palaces army in the horizon, Nie Yunbin angrily roared!</p>
 <p>The three great palaces had already lost the majority of its higher ups. What else could they rely on to fight Soul Alliance? Could it be those scattered sand-like army members in the western area?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, no matter how angry or contemptuous he was, Nie Yunbin knew that the roaring army in the distance wasn’t like scattered sand. Their courage was unprecedented, and their uplifting moral had caused even the mighty and dignified Wanxiang City to tremble!!</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>As the rain and blood mixed together on the main street, Chu Mu and Chao Lengchuan turned around. They looked at the distant hills outside the city and at the army dressed in all white.</p>
 <p>“This…” said Chu Mu, somewhat absent-mindedly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s our army!” Chao Lengchuan had a rapturous expression!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The three great palaces’ army! This was definitely the three great palaces’ army!!</p>
 <p>There was only one reason for wearing white armor. It was to engage in a bloody fight with the enemy till the end!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu’s emotions soared. One month ago when he had seen Soul Alliance threaten them to surrender, he had realized that the three great palaces’ army could very well collapse because of this. This fight could end up becoming his fight, alone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He never expected that while leaderless and spiritless, there still existed a group of brave warriors who were like those on the execution stage. They would rather die than stand on Soul Alliance’s side!</p>
 <p>They didn’t need to go and organize themselves. They had decided that today was the signal to gather and rushed from all sides to gather under Wanxiang City!</p>
 <p>Among these people were those wholeheartedly devoted to the three great palaces, those that had irreconcilable anger towards Soul Alliance and those that resolved to save their captured comrades, colleagues, friends, family….&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was an army that had thrown aside any considerations about life or death. No matter what their reason was, they all had the same goal: fight till the end!</p>
 <p>The surging tide of an army instantaneously swept past the hills and approached the outer city of Wanxiang City!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu turned around and saw Senior Elder Teng in the distance leading the charge!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On that day, Chu Mu had personally seen Senior Elder Teng turn his back on the city wall. Not a single tear was shed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu thought that in a decision between family and the palace, Senior Elder Teng had chosen the later. Yet, in reality, Senior Elder Teng didn’t choose the latter. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had chosen to use his own fight to devote himself to the palace while also using his life to rescue his family. In that majestic army was also a large group of people who had made the same choice!</p>
 <p>“Can you guys see?!! Tell me, what are you still afraid of?!!” Senior Elder Teng used a mental voice to loudly roar!</p>
 <p>When the army had quietly gathered outside Wanxiang City, they had discussed how to break into the city.</p>
 <p>However, when they saw the blood being to flow out of Wanxiang City from the distance and saw those three people shatter an army of ten thousand, therein lay the answer to their discussion!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How would they break into the city?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Obviously by slaughtering their way in!!</p>
 <p>The killing intent from Chu Mu, Chao Lengchuan, and Ye Wansheng had ignited their blood. They had come here to fight till the end. Those three people had even dared to enter Wanxiang City alone, so what did they, an army of over ten thousand, have to fear?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Therefore, when the leading Senior Elder Teng let out his roar, everyone’s answer was the same!</p>
 <p>“Long long long long~~~~~”</p>
 <p>The western side of the city had been broken through already. The three great palaces’ high ranking army easily stepped over the weakened city walls, onto the bloody water and into Wanxiang City. Along the main street, they chased after the footsteps of those three people!!</p>
 <p>“Chu Fangchen, Prince Chao, leave the army for us!!” Senior Elder Teng was further away on the long main street, so he used a mental voice to speak to them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu had been watching this brave army charge in and an elated smile had arisen on his face. It seemed that this fight wouldn’t just be the three of them!</p>
 <p>A low ranking army would have no threat towards Chu Mu because of Mo Xie.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Mo Xie’s Species Calamity would be suppressed by a middle or high ranking army because they had high class emperor experts. Ye Wansheng wouldn’t be able to kill all of them!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Perhaps a single one of Chu Mu’s techniques could annihilate thousands in a middle or high ranking army. However, Chu Mu’s enemies were not limited to these armies. Instead, there were those overbearing dominator rank experts from Soul Alliance!! If he wasted too much energy on these armies, how would he fight against the Four Heroes, Li Hong, Wu Kuang and Yi Jun?</p>
 <p>The appearance of the three great palaces army was undoubtedly help in his hour of need. It also made Chu Mu realize that the true three great palaces wouldn’t collapse because the higher ups were defeated. Chu Mu also believed that even if the three great palaces would no longer exist in the future, there would still be a group of people who would always oppose Soul Alliance!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Senior Elder Teng, I’ll leave it to you then!” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu knew that in an army against army fight, there would be countless sacrifices. However, in front of such a lofty execution stage, would they really retreat?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Mu didn’t count the number of people in the three great palaces’ army because these people were already enough!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>The middle city had already been constructed into a well-fortified stronghold. This stronghold was covered by countless plants and couldn’t be compared to those decorative walls on the outer city!</p>
 <p>Atop the stronghold, Soul Alliance’s army was lined up in rows, standing there in defense. As they looked down from above, they watched the flood of white in the outer city!</p>
 <p>Most of them were sneering. Sneering at their overestimation of capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the enormous army in the stronghold hadn’t realized that the boundless rain was no longer colorless. Instead, it was now a slightly blue and odorless medicine rain!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the medicine rain landed on middle city, it dispersed through the damp air along with the wind and rain…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nobody knew what usage this medicine rain had, nor did anyone discover that the air they were breathing in was mixed with a smell that was difficult to discern. This was because their entire attention was focused on the three great palaces army.</p>
 <p>As the large army approaching, the atmosphere turned abnormally tense. As the downpour of rain dripped down on them, it was like swords and halberds crying out!</p>
 <p>Blood and water filled the air, but what was inextinguishable was the flames of war!!!&nbsp;</p>
