Presumably, there would be a large group of people who would be eliminated. When they encountered a few of these savage and terrible criminals, numerous young people would even lose their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do now? Could it be that this breakthrough’s success or failure is determined by how many prisoners are killed?” Ye Qingzi asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>

Half a day has passed, so somevthings have probably already occured.” Chu Mu rode on his Night Thunder Dream Beast in front of Ye Qingzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi began to head up the mountain when it was nearly evening. The sunset was shining on the ground, and the mountain shadow was growing longer, making it look like an enormous dragon living in seclusion there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them began to walk up the slope, the smell of fresh blood began to waft down from higher up the mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was extremely sensitive to the smell of blood and indicated for Ye Qingzi to stop first. He then rode on the Night Thunder Dream Beast, agilely making his way around the higher ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I couldn’t help but fight. I thought that the eighth realm young generation would be stronger. They’re only this much.” a crude laugh rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu looked on, and quickly found the owner of the voice. This was the same boorish prisoner who had been cultivating next to the pond. This person looked boorish, sloppy, and his facial hair hadn’t been trimmed in a long while.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This prisoner’s brown eyes were full of killing intent. Right now, this boorish prisoner’s eyes were staring at two pale faced young competitors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of these young competitors had lost five soul pets, and the smell of blood had come from their five soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next to the boorish prisoner were another three prisoners who were adjacent to soul pets that did not have weak aura. Clearly, with the cooperation with these four prisoners, he had easily defeated these young competitors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Release the signal, and have the competition authority guards throw the two of them out. That way each of our sentences will be decreased.” said the low-voiced man with a short jacket.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This short jacket man’s age was about thirty years old. Chu Mu could use use his soul remembrance to determine the strength of the other three soul pet trainers, but he was unable to determine this short jacket man’s strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu was presently a fifth remembrance spirit master, and this was rather high in the second grade. Yet, this short jacket man’s soul remembrance was above his.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four prisoners didn’t kill the two young competitors, but released a signal and had the competition authority guards to come here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competition authority guards were middle aged people. Their strength was much higher than the prisoners so even if the prisoners were wicked, the prisoners wouldn’t dare try and slight them when the guards landed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s best if you guys are well-behaved. If I find that you guys killed someone. The punishment will be determined accordingly and you won’t be able to escape!” the competition authority guard wearing silver armor swept his gaze over the four prisoners and spoke in a stern voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But if these small things want to kill us and we kill them while resisting, does this also warrant punishment?” said the rather tall prisoner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver armored competition authority guard wore a smile on his face as he said: “Did you really think that us putting you here was to truly lessen your sentence? A majority of people like you being sent here is equivalent to a death sentence. Prepare your minds, eh. You guys don’t have the qualifications to be of equivalent status to us and the competitors.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you saying!” the boorish prisoner immediately opened his eyes wide and looked extremely angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, the competition authority guard’s words had angered the other three prisoners. After all, most of the prisoners who were released here died, so there was no need for them to go easy on the competitors. However, because the they were inherently unequal, the prisoners couldn’t kill the competitors while the competitors could kill the prisoners.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys are merely a tool in the competition. Don’t place yourselves so highly.” arrogantly said the silver guard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One small thing. When your grandfather, I, was sweeping through Tianxia City, you hadn’t even started playing in the mud. If this was in the past, one of my secondary soul pets would be able to annihilate you!” the boorish man’s temper was very violent, and after he heard those words, his face immediately flushed red and he pointed at the silver armor man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the matter? If you want to die, I can fulfill your wish.” the silver armor prisoner looked with contempt at this prisoner while his tone turned ice cold as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhang Tong, don’t be impulsive.” the short jacket man pulled him back while also having his soul pet suppress the boorish prisoner’s agitated soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majority of these four peoples’ main pets had been killed or sealed. Obviously their main pets were not the competition authority guards’ opponents and if they made a move, it would be them that died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Behave yourselves!” the two competition authority guards let out a cold harrumph and each of them picked up a wounded young man as they flew into the air with them off Heavenly Life Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two competition authority guards had wing type soul pets and flew very quickly. Not long after, they had reached high up in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four prisoners all looked coldly at the two arrogant guards. When they were finally far away, the prisoner called Zhang Tong indignantly said: “I knew we should have killed those two brats. That way we could vent some anger. Back then when I hadn’t entered hell yet, which person wasn’t respectful towards me…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t talk about the past. Right now we’re prisoners. Each of us has to defeat five competitors, and our penalty will be lessened by half. It’s better if we’re more conservative. After all, even if we kill people, we’ll still be captured by the Tianxia competition authorities. We won’t be able to flee.” said the short jacket man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he got there, the short jacket man suddenly creased his brows, and his eyes darted to one side like a sword. Then he looked closely at the location Chu Mu was at.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the matter, Cai Ji?” asked the slightly bloated female middle aged soul pet trainer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s a person. Just now I sensed a soul remembrance pulse, but I thought it was the competition authority guard’s soul remembrance. But now that they’ve left, the soul remembrance still exists.” said Cai Ji in a low voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boorish Zhang Tong was in fit right now, and when he heard that there was someone, he immediately jumped onto his Multi Colored Devil Tiger and charged in the direction Cai Ji had pointed in!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Multi Colored Devil Tiger had already reached the ninth phase low class monarch rank. Its strength would be among the stronger of the second grade. The Multi Colored Devil Tiger pounced forward and abruptly let out a roar!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roar carried a sound wave that expanded in all directions. It was an attempt to scare the enemy into making the mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roar reverberated on the hill. Zhang Tong rode on the Multi Colored Devil Tiger once around the area, but didn’t discover the traces of anyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boss Cai Ji, have you not fought for a long time or something and you’ve had a misperception? There’s no one there!” Zhang Tong was somewhat vexed as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps.” Cai Ji had immediately released his soul remembrance when he detected the movement, but he hadn’t detected anything. Added on Zhang Tong’s patrol and upon determining that there was no one else in the surroundings, he could only believe that it was a misconception…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m in a fit of anger right now. Let’s just kill them now. There are definitely many things that need our spanking. If there’s a woman, I don’t care if there’s a punishment or not!” Zhang Tong clearly was a fellow with a violent temper. After speaking, he immediately rode up the mountain on his Multi Colored Devil Tiger.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside them were the Night Thunder Dream Beast and Purple Robe Dream Beast. These prisoners were all middle aged, and perhaps their strength wasn’t much, but their perceptive abilities were very sharp. The two of their Dream Beasts had simultaneously used hiding techniques in order to barely escape their search.&nbsp;</span></p>

We must be extra careful.” Chu Mu’s heart shook as he spoke.</span></p>

There indeed was a strength discrepancy between the young and middle aged generation.&nbsp;</span></p>

If they were to directly clash, prematurely expending their fighting strength was not wise. After all, the realm breakthrough lasted half a month.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu and Ye Qingzi intentionally waited for a while. After ensuring that these people were a distance aways from them, they finally continue on.&nbsp;</span></p>

In effect, they were using the four prisoners to clear the path for them.&nbsp;</span></p>

These prisoners weren’t weak as they had gotten rid of another few young competitors.&nbsp;</span></p>

If there are four of them they must defeat a total of 20 young competitors. The Battle of the Realm Competition, having already reached the eighth realm, is already near the top of the pyramid in terms of strength. There are probably 20 Soul Palace competitors on Heavenly Life Mountain. That means that if all four prisoners are to cut their sentence in half, there’s a high chance they’ll bump into the strongest competitors of a large faction. The reality is that any of a faction’s top three will be difficult for them to deal with. Thus, the probability of them being able to reduce their sentences in half is extremely extremely low.” Ye Qingzi softly said to Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. The prisoners are definitely not just limited to them. If there are many groups of prisoners competing, and they all defeat these rather weak members, then there will ultimately have to be many of them that face stronger competitors in hopes of halving their sentences. I would presume that the Tianxia competition authorities have calculated it already. The strength of each competitor cannot be predicted by the Tianxia competition authorities, but they can use the data from past years to estimate the average strength of the eighth realm’s competitors. Then, according to the data, they can release a certain number of prisoners that is enough to eliminate most of the competitors while also ensuring that a good majority of the prisoners themselves are defeated or killed…” said Chu Mu. After speaking, he thought of something and added, “The eighth realm’s battle is very intense because if the number of prisoners and competitors are very uneven, the competition will undergo a “you die and I live” type of battle to even out the number on each side…”&nbsp;</span></p>

Suddenly, a smile blossomed on her face and her beautiful eyes looked at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>

Her smile was beautiful but also gave people a feeling of intelligence. His heart slightly shook and he subconsciously reached for Ye Qingzi’s soft white hand to pull her closer to him.</span></p>

His intentions were already very clear and there ostensibly was no need to explain.&nbsp;</span></p>

Of course, he didn’t loosen his hand. Ye Qingzi’s hands were small and delicate, white and soft. Squeezing it felt like squeezing soft jade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You said just now that the number from each side would trend towards equilibrium. Thus, I feel that this should be a crucial part of the realm breakthrough. Half a month is capable of causing numerous competitors and prisoners to meet each other in various places, and the chances of fights breaking out is very high. The prisoners want to eliminate the competitors in order to decrease their sentences while also ensure that they are not killed by the competitors. Therefore, they will not go and provoke stronger competitors. This will gradually cause a group of stronger prisoners and competitors to remain on Heavenly Life Mountain, and it is this group that will successfully breakthrough the realm…” Ye Qingzi’s face was slightly red as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ya, that makes sense. For each five people a prisoner kills, the prisoner’s sentence is lessened. Thus, if the competition authorities control the number of prisoners, they will be able to determine the number of successful competitors.” after listening to Ye Qingzi’s analysis, Chu Mu finally understood the competition authority’s goal!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder which competition authority higher up thought of this…” said Ye Qingzi.</span></p>

It’s very likely that numerous competitors won’t understand how to successfully breakthrough the realm even at the very end.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
