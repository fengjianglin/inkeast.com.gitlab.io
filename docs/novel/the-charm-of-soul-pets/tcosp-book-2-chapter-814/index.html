 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had practically all of the spirits he had previously accumulated, and finally allowed Mo Xie to successfully breakthrough the low class emperor to the middle class emperor rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the senior’s letters had recorded, if the Seven Sins Fox wasn’t strengthened correctly, this route would gradually dig away at its species potential. Growing from the low class emperor rank to the middle class emperor rank already expended enormous resources; moreover, it also required a composition method that expended great effort.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu truly didn’t know where he was going to find the resources to strengthen Mo Xie to the high class emperor rank. He really did have to find another route.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the middle class emperor rank, Mo Xie had the advantage in speed. Her demon attribute was a main attribute and made it so that she didn’t have to fear the nimbleness of a wing type soul pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, even if speed and dodging were Mo Xie’s strengths, this didn’t mean that Chu Mu wouldn’t have Mo Xie directly clash with a wing type middle class emperor in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just exhaust it first!’ Chu Mu didn’t plan on summoning Ning to fight so quickly. After all, the enemy was an expert with a high class emperor. Even if Ning was strong, it would be able to fight alone against one high class emperor and four middle class emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu wu wu~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a long time Mo Xie had fought, and she was exceptionally excited right now. Her silver fur fluttered in the wind and the feeling of running to her heart's content and tasting the blood of the enemy made her silver eyes twinkle!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie didn’t continue to step on the air. She began to run along the vast pale-white snowy ground. The charge just now had been so that Li Zhan would chase after her. Presumably, he would feel confident that he could kill Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He unexpectedly left his defensive line. Suicide!” looking down from high above at the running silver noble fox, Li Zhan laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this commander hid behind his defensive line, it would waste quite a bit of Li Zhan’s time to breakthrough. After all, those peak monarch rank plant type armies and defensive armies weren’t easy to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Zhan obviously knew that Chu Mu was intentionally drawing him away. However, where could he run to? If he wanted to draw the enemy away, he had to have the ability to survive. In Li Zhan’s opinion, this young spirit emperor would not be able to escape from his grasp!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Zhan didn’t waste time and as he approached Chu Mu, he immediately chanted incantations, summoning his other soul pets!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the enemy intended on fleeing, Li Zhan would have his middle class emperors slaughter their way into the army. If he didn’t continue to flee, he would definitely die under his claws!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, when Li Zhan summoned all his soul pets, he discovered that the opponent had only dared to circle a few times in the surrounding, but wasn’t actually fleeing afar!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just a single middle class emperor? He is truly courting death!” Li Zhan discovered that the opponent hadn’t continued to summon other soul pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if he wasn’t summoning, so be it. There were definitely no traps here. Promptly, Li Zhan ordered his Sun Demon to attack!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Demon was Li Zhan’s high class emperor. It was an elemental kingdom creature that was covered in raging flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hm? My luck isn’t bad!!” Chu Mu saw that the opponent’s high class emperor was unexpectedly a fire type elemental, and a smile rose on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice types and fire types could counter fire types, thus making Ning have the huge advantage!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the spirit teacher army battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were over ten thousand people and soul pets from either spirit teacher army. The number was enormous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit teacher commander was Teng Lang while the opponent was also another powerful commander. He had suppressed Teng Lang to a terrifying degree.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opposing commander was called He Xikuang. His main pets were similar to Teng Lang in that they were all five middle class emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Teng Lang’s secondary soul pets had been exhausted first and he used his main pets first. A lot of his main pets’ fighting strength had also been exhausted by the secondary pets, causing Teng Lang to be very passive when he fought against his opponent’s main pets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">he moment Commander Teng Lang was suppressed, He Xikuang began to occasionally have his middle class emperors use techniques on the spirit teacher army. This was extremely damaging to Teng Lang’s spirit teachers, because a casual attack from a middle class emperor could instakill a group of commanders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit, I just had to fight this fellow!” Teng Lang grit his teeth and was a bit annoyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their secondary soul pets were not equal, and his main pets were also countered. Teng Lang’s luck really was a bit bad. If things kept going like this, they would definitely slowly lose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can’t go on like this. Shi, let’s stake it all!” the spirit teacher army could not lose, because it would cause a chain effect. Teng Lang would not allow himself to lose here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teng Lang jumped onto the back of his Ice Mountain Lion, and immediately charged after He Xikuang who had left his army’s defense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xikuang was ostensibly waiting for Teng Lang and wore a sinister smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beng!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the snowy ground exploded. As the Ice Mountain Lion ran, the ground under it suddenly gave way and instantly, countless vines appeared, forcibly dragging Teng Lang into the trap!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, idiot!” He Xikuang let out a loud laugh. He had taken advantage of Teng Lang’s impatience and set this trap. Unexpectedly, he had succeeded. As long as he could get rid of Teng Lang’s Ice Mountain Lion, Teng Lang’s other soul pets didn’t need to be feared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master Teng!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The faces of the generals instantly paled. The army was originally at a disadvantage. If their commander were to fall, the army would quickly crumble!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were unable to help in a middle class emperor fight unless they mobilized the army’s strength to attack the opponent. However, if they did this, the opposing army would deliver a fatal blow to them!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quickly you will understand the meaning of 'one small mistake will lead to the collapse of an army.'" wildly and sharply laughed Xi Hekuang. He immediately sent his other soul pets to destroy the Ice Mountain Lion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of their techniques bombarded the trap, causing practically nothing to remain on the snowy ground. Teng Lang’s other soul pets were also unable to come to the rescue in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hou hou hou hou!!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An angry roar suddenly rang out from the underground. A frosty aura surged out of the cracked ground, nearly freezing all of the energy!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the trap, an icy light blossomed, giving people a chilly feeling that made them tremble. Along with a stubborn roar, it formed an enormous aura that suppressed He Xikuang’s soul pets!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… what happened?!” Xi Hekuang was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being bombarded like that, the Ice Mountain Lion should either be dead or seriously wounded. Why had its majesty suddenly erupted and its viciousness become even more profound?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You dog, your death has arrived!” under the ground, Teng Lang gave an angry roar!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the ground cracked and ice shattered. The thick layer of ice that was covering the Ice Mountain Lion was thrown off as it jumped out of the trap. The vines that were restricting it were frozen before shattering. They were unable to stop this extremely powerful ice mountain body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hou hou hou hou!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Mountain Lion let out a cry, causing a violent wind and snowstorm to angrily descend, rushing towards He Xikuang and his vine type emperor!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surging snow was filled with trembling killing intent. It made He Xikuang stunned and for a moment he couldn’t react!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“High… high… high class emperor!!!!” He Xikuang stuttered, as he watched the ice and snow energy bombard him. This unstoppable majesty swept past him and instantly covered his vine type emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the vine type emperor were to put up a defense, it would still have been frozen by the icy snow angry roar before shattering to pieces!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sudden change caused everyone watching to open their eyes wide. It was hard to believe that after falling into the trap, the Ice Mountain Lion would be able to shockingly counter attack and instakill the opponent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“High class emperor! Young Master Teng’s Ice Mountain Lion has advanced a rank. It broke through at the crucial moment!!!” the generals couldn’t believe their eyes, and had faces full of happiness!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rank advance was extremely crucial!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they experienced the Universe Ice Gates, Heavenly Concubine Mu Qingyi had predicted that Teng Lang’s Ice Mountain Lion would soon advance a rank. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Teng Lang’s Ice Mountain Lion had advanced to the high class emperor rank. Moreover, it had done so in such an important fight and just as things were about to go downhill. This made everyone extremely happy. Even Guan Guan and Xiao Tong who were in the air with extremely worried expressions wore smiles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can I, Teng Lang, be so easily defeated. Scram to the path of hell for this young master!” Teng Lang yelled. He urged his Ice Mountain Lion to charge at He Xikuang’s two middle class emperors!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xikuang’s expression was pale. He clearly had the advantage, yet the opponent had broken through when he was about to die. This was too unjust of a death!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching the emperor rank, advancing a rank was difficult and doing so in a battle would make others want to cry. Indeed, if this was done at a crucial moment, others would really spit out blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Teng Lang, being able to breakthrough while in between life and death, is crazy enough.” <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Qingyi i</span>ndifferently evaluated . She then gazed at Chu Mu’s fight, which was even further away. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When an ice type high class emperor fought a fire type high class emperor, the advantage was instantaneously seen. Presumably, Soul Alliance’s Li Zhan would very sullenly need four middle class emperors to assist in his fight. Otherwise, he would be suppressed to a very miserable extent by the opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, due to Teng Lang breaking into the high class emperor, after he killed He Xikuang, the spirit teacher army gradually gained the advantage. Teng Lang came to assist Chu Mu a bit, causing Li Zhan to ultimately die a miserable death since Teng Lang’s high class emperor was also an ice type…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He Xikuang and Li Zhan have both lost.” Soul Alliance’s general’s voice was gloomy. His face was ashen as he spoke to Mo Ling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving this bad news, the originally calm Fourth Hero Mo Ling finally changed his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t care about the first defeat, but the second defeat made him slightly aware. As for the third defeat, Mo Ling couldn’t help but silently curse!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These underlings were all useless. At the crucial moment, couldn’t they just make things easier for him?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn’t Li Zhan have a high class emperor? Why did he lose?!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?!” Mo Ling could no longer underestimate the opponent’s spirit master army and spirit teacher army’s commanders because they had begun to eat away at the spirit emperor army’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The opponent’s spirit master commander is called Chu Fangchen. He is very strong. Previously, he relied on one special middle class emperor Binding Wind Spirit to kill seven of our army’s middle class emperors. Afterwards, he summoned a high class ice type emperor and after obtaining help from the spirit teacher army’s commander, he defeated Li Zhan. The opposing spirit teacher army’s commander is Teng Lang and is Soul Palace’s Third Young Master. It seems that in the fight, his soul pet broke through…” the general read out the information in his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s this hard to deal with two insignificant people?!!” Mo Ling’s tone turned cold and he used soul remembrance to say: “Qin Wu, what is your ability to fight multiple battles like?”</span></p>
