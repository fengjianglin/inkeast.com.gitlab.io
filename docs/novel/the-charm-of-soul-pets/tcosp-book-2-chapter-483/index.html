It’s simple. An adult Mo Ye couldn’t possibly nurture that many offspring. They could only provide the food and protection for one to two younglings at most.

Many times, one could find a Mo Ye under second phase wandering around in a forest alone.

These Mo Ye were the ones thrown away by their parents at birth…….”</span></p>

Chu Mu half leaned on a tree in the light-speckled forest. His eyes watched the rays of light that sneaked through the leaves. Listening to Old Li’s description of the events that just happened, the only thing echoing through his head was the description of the Mo Ye species that Chu Tiancheng had told him very early on…...</span></p>

It fell into the nest of thousand feet millipedes. There’s thousands upon thousands of thousand feet millipedes…...There isn’t much time left for the realm passing. What you have to do right now is stay calm, rationally turn around, pass through this forest, dodge the puppet, and reach Lake Chen. Then, you should heal your soul and find another chance to deal with the female puppet in eighth and ninth realm, and not go kill yourself in the thousand feet millipede cave……”</span></p>

Countless thousand feet centipede and a top tier monarch rank ten thousand feet millipede, you wouldn’t even be able to reach the bottom of the pit!” Old Li pulled Chu Mu aside and said very sternly.</span></p>

They were undefeatable opponents, even scarier than the female master. Yet, what was pushing the man to kill his way back into the corpse ridden, rotten, and death filled abyss without any hesitation? Was it simply because his soul pact hadn’t been broken yet, and the Mo Ye was still laying at the bottom of the abyss gulping its last breath?</span></p>

He had nothing to do with rationality, with reality, with life or death at this moment. He was basing everything simply on a hard to understand “faith”, something no other soul pet trainer would do…...</span></p>

Similarly, many weaker soul pets used humans to survive. Zhan Ye was lucky to sign a soul pact with a human. At least, humans knew how to make a soul pet grow in the safest and most logical manner, letting it become stronger than its species.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, Zhan Ye was abandoned by the soul pet trainer named Yang, becoming an abandoned soul pet.</span></p>

It had already been abandoned twice, yet it was still willing to sacrifice itself for its owner in crucial moments. Initially, Zhan Ye was so weak it couldn’t survive in its little forest, being easily beaten by Mo Xie. Yet, in Chu Mu’s eyes, Zhan Ye was from beginning to end the noblest of life.</span></p>
