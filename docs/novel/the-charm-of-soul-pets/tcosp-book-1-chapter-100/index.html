  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="paragraph">
   Chu Mu looked again into Shang Shi’s Spatial Ring for treasure, and what made him elated was that there just happened to be an ice type Healing Medicine.
   <p></p>
   <p>The squeamish Ice Air Fairy was still constantly moaning with pain in Chu Mu’s soul pet space, so this ice type medicine was found just in time. Chu Mu immediately put the Healing Medicine into his soul pet space and allowed his Ice Air Fairy to take it.</p>
   <p>Normally, no matter how deeply wounded the soul pets of the Elemental Kingdom were, as long as they weren’t dead, they could definitely recover within a month. The main reason why many soul pet trainers were in love with Elemental Kingdom soul pets was their recovery ability.</p>
   <p>The Ice Air Fairy’s arm could probably regrow within about ten days. Taking Shang Shi’s ice type Healing Medicine into account, it would probably only take four days.</p>
   <p>Shang Shi’s Spatial Ring held a very complete set of Recovery and Healing Medicine, all of them at the fourth level, and ten per type.</p>
   <p>This practice of Shang Shi’s should be similar to many other experienced soul pet trainers. When they go out, they would prepare all types of Healing and Recovery Medicines to their very best. Though under normal circumstances they wouldn’t use it, under crucial circumstances they would need it.</p>
   <p>“Third level wood type Soul Crystal?” Chu Mu very quickly discovered another pretty good item.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu had a second level beast type soul crystal before, and now he had received a wood type soul crystal as well. Soul crystals were always valuable on the market. In the future when Chu Mu got more soul pets, he would definitely spend a sizeable amount of money on soul cores and soul crystals, so Chu Mu had to maintain some wealth at all times.</p>
   <p>First level single type soul crystals were around one hundred gold each. Second level would be one thousand gold, and third level would be around five thousand gold.</p>
   <p>Shang Shi’s Spatial Ring only had these things. To a Soul Pet Trainer this was slightly too little, so he presumably stored most of his belongings somewhere before he came to Prison Island.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu put most of his original things back into his soul pet space. Just as he was about to leave, his Ice Air Fairy immediately reminded him.</p>
   <p>“Almost forgot, there’s still a delicacy for you in the abyss.” Chu Mu laughed and said.</p>
   <p>Mo Xie’s body started shrinking, her six tails morphing together as she became a cute little fox and lept onto Chu Mu’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>When not fighting, Mo Xie liked to maintain her Pitiful Appearance and let Chu Mu carry her around while this sly creature dozed off lazily on Chu Mu’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>After walking into the abyss again, a gust of frozen air once again assaulted Chu Mu, causing him to feel cold all over his body.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu walked into the shrubs and started using his soul remembrance to search for the source of the cold. Very soon, Chu Mu found, in the center of a brush, the roots of the Cold Abyssal Ginseng.</p>
   <p>The Cold Abyssal Ginseng was very fragile. Unwilling to damage it even in the slightest, Chu Mu was very careful with the extraction process.</p>
   <p>Cold Abyssal Ginseng was a very cold plant. If a normal person were to touch it by hand, they could be injected with cold poison. Those with weak resistances may even instantly die from the cold poison.</p>
   <p>Chu Mu and the Ice Air Fairy had signed a soul pact, so his soul gained some resistance to coldness. This third level Cold Abyssal Ginseng’s coldness was something Chu Mu could still resist.</p>
   <p>One hour later, Chu Mu finally dug the Ice Air Fairy’s delicacy out. Holding the snow white Cold Abyssal Ginseng, Chu Mu smiled, “Should be enough to let Ning enter third phase.”</p>
   <p>“Ling~Ling” Once Chu Mu got the Ginseng, the Ice Air Fairy immediately let out an excited cry, urging Chu Mu to feed it the Ginseng.</p>
   <p>The Cold Abyssal Ginseng could be directly eaten. Chu Mu used his soul remembrance to guide the Ginseng into his soul pet space and let the Ice Air Fairy eat it.</p>
   <p>The Ice Air Fairy had long awaited this delicacy, and almost devoured it in a single bite before lying down comfortably in the soul pet space.</p>
   <p>“Rest well…...”</p>
   <p>Chu Mu was just about to let the Ice Air Fairy rest and heal its wounds, but halfway through he stopped, as he noticed that the arm that should’ve taken three or four days to heal was regenerating at a noticeable speed!</p>
   <p>“Ling”</p>
   <p>Ning let out an excited cry as its body underwent another change. Its snowy and icy skin became even more transparent, containing no impurity!</p>
   <p>“It metamorphosed that quickly?!” Chu Mu stared. He didn’t imagine the effects of the Cold Abyssal Ginseng to be this direct!</p>
   <p>Though the body shape of the Fairy didn’t change, its skin was completely altered. Before, its skin was only Third level initial stage, yet after become third phase, its Ice Type skin unbelievably leapt straight to third level late stage!</p>
   <p>A normally talented Ice Air Fairy would only have the third level initial stage skin when reaching the third phase. Ning’s exceptional talent allowed it to be two levels ahead of others in his species!</p>
   <p>Third level late stage defense, plus the effects of Ice Armor, its defense was comparable to that of the fourth level intermediate stage. Having a fourth level defense when it was only at the third phase, Ning’s defense was a lot more than just a bit abnormal!!!</p>
   <p>Chu Mu remembered that Cao Yi had a Dire Wolf. That wolf was probably around third phase fifth stage. Its attacks could probably break open any defense under the fourth level, but it couldn’t possibly damage any defense above the fourth level. This meant that the third phase Ning, even if it were to fight with Cao Yi’s Dire Wolf, had a high chance of winning!</p>
   <p>With both soul pets already at third phase and both high class warrior rank soul pets with amazing talent, the power Chu Mu had was getting closer and closer to that of the tyrannical Cao Yi. It was believable that, with a little more time, Chu Mu could surpass Cao Yi. If he met Cao Yi on the island, Chu Mu would definitely personally defeat Cao Yi.</p>
   <p>Walking back to the place where he hid all his scrolls, Chu Mu opened it up and saw that within the past ten days, the prisoner deaths on the island grew again, with over five hundred prisoners’ names going dark.</p>
   <p>The prisoners’ strengths weren’t uniform. Many of them probably couldn’t survive on this dangerous island and were directly eliminated.</p>
   <p>But, as the amount of deaths increases, the remaining prisoners would get stronger. Chu Mu’s enemies would become stronger, so Chu Mu had to constantly increase his strength, to be able to become the one person left alive on the island, to be able to return to Gangluo City, and to use his strength to redeem his disgraces!!</p>
   <p>Standing at a high place, Chu Mu looked into the distant unknown area covered by a misty layer of fog.</p>
   <p>On this island, there were many strong members and countless strong soul pets. But, in Chu Mu’s eyes, they were all simply steps on a staircase for him to become stronger, and they would allow him to walk into a higher and more powerful realm!</p>
