 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel that the Heaven Boundary Monuments are trying to convey some form of information. It’s like a story that’s split into ten parts. Until we gather these separate parts together, it will be difficult to understand what meaning the Heaven Boundary Monuments are trying to convey.” Princess Jinrou meticulously wrote down the words Chu Mu wrote, in their own special way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, we now have information from three Heaven Boundary Monuments, right?” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. The information from these three Heaven Boundary Monuments aren’t linked. Our Western Kingdom’s Heaven Boundary Monument writes about a species that attempted to rebel, but ended up suffering severe punishment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What species was it?” asked Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know. It didn’t say. It only said that it was extremely strong.” Princess Jinrou glanced at Chu Mu and continued, “Wanxiang Realm’s Heaven Boundary Monument writes about the Ancient Flood Dragon Person and describes how powerful he once was.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew about the Ancient Flood Dragon Person, and had found him lying dormant under the Wind Palace together with Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Next is Wupan Continent’s Lin City’s Heaven Boundary Monument. It writes about the strongest species on Wupan Continent from 5000 years ago until now. These species, even in our generation, are still like gods. This includes an Underworld that stepped into the undying rank. It was written that an Underworld once fought against an extremely powerful rebelling species and ultimately lost. This species is probably the one recorded on Western Kingdom’s Heaven Boundary Monument.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou determined this from the last bit. There was a chance all of the Heaven Boundary Monuments told of an ancient legend. These legends had something to do with the world’s strongest creatures and species. Thus, Princess Jinrou guessed that the Heaven Boundary Monuments could be an inscribed stele of history that used special words and illusions to tell others the story of creatures that reached the summit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. When he had entered Wing Palace, Old Li had told him as much. It seemed that Heaven Boundary Monuments really were related to the strongest of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet world embodied an undulating development. It was like a country that, throughout its long history, as long as it wasn’t completely destroyed, would have both its prosperous times and times of decline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul pet world had its own prosperous times and times of declines. Nobody could say that the soul pets from 5000 years ago or 10,000 years ago were weaker than now. In fact, it was entirely possible that the species advantages of the creatures of a certain era were far stronger than the current strongest species. Unfortunately, the law of nature didn't mean that the strongest species would remain prosperous throughout time. Instead, the law of nature would choose the species that could survive over the long-term.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The living world was a cycle. Whether this era was strong or weak could only be determined by future people using the records left in history to compare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the Heaven Boundary Monuments were such a record that allowed people from later generations to understand the entire long process of creature reproduction, rank advancement, mutation, aging, and eventual degeneration. It would also illuminate which creatures truly stood at the top of the pyramid and became a god over all other living creatures!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I went to Aerial forest, I gathered information on a fourth Heaven Boundary Monument. The story should be even more connected. With the information from ten Heaven Boundary Monuments, perhaps we’ll be able to uncover the mystery of the world!” Princess Jinrou’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou had been researching ancient languages in order to uncover the stories buried by time. When she realized that nobody over the past few thousands of years had uncovered the Heaven Boundary Monument’s mystery, which she was about to do, she obviously grew excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was much more enthusiastic about the Heaven Boundary Monuments than Chu Mu. Her goal was visibly to collect the records on the ten Heaven Boundary Monuments.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know where the other Heaven Boundary Monuments are?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are another three in Wupan Continent and Zhengming Continent. The remaining three are not within human territory. It’s said that one lies in the depths of Eternal Ocean, one lies at the edge of the world, and there is one more which I don’t know is located where.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The documents that I’ve gathered from various places don’t have any records of the last Heaven Boundary Monuments. In fact, many people think that there are only nine Heaven Boundary Monuments because, despite scouring every corner of the world, they haven’t found the last Heaven Boundary Monument.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Many scholars have their own conjectures. One of them is an old scholar from a thousand years ago who thought that the last Heaven Boundary Monument is in an independent space. In other words, the last Heaven Boundary Monument isn’t in our plane or dimension of existence. It could be in an independent space akin to the Holy Regions, Immortal City, and Sealed Tower.” said Princess Jinrou in one breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu nodded his head. Since he was a Monument Tear Individual, there would probably be people who came calling to him even if he ignored all of this. Indeed, Ning Maner had told him about the Fake Monument Tear Individuals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he had to understand the Heaven Boundary Monuments.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they talked, a ray of weak sunlight shone down from the horizon, faintly illuminating Princess Jinrou’s spectral blue and transparent body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou was still focused on telling Chu Mu about all the information she gathered about the Heaven Boundary Monuments; she was also making guesses towards the soul pets mentioned on the Heaven Boundary Monuments. She didn’t realize that light of dawn was shining upon her, illuminating her body with a beautiful and enchanting holiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even in spectral form, Princess Jinrou had not only not lost her absolute beauty, but additionally added on a noble and gracefully charming figure like an azure lotus. This wasn’t the first time Chu Mu’s heart had been attracted by such youthfulness. It was just like the first time when he saw her on the deck of the boat. Despite wearing a thin veil, her melancholic and beautiful eyes still made Chu Mu’s heart thump.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu watched her until he grew absent-minded. Princess Jinrou thought Chu Mu had been entranced by her words, and wore a thin smile on her face as she concluded her conjectures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The things I know of are extremely limited. I can only guess this much. As for the Underworld’s and Ancient Flood Dragon Person’s power, I feel that the Underworld is still stronger. The Ancient Flood Dragon Person is the weakest one of the Sons of Eternal Ocean. Its period of rule was during these few thousand years. The other Sons of Eternal Ocean ruled a few thousand years longer than it. However, I’m not sure if they’re still alive…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Princes Jinrou spoke, she suddenly discovered that her lips were extremely close to Chu Mu’s handsome face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jinrou stopped talking and looked flusteredly at Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, Princess Jinrou’s mind suddenly echoed with the words Chu Mu had just said: “You are the most beautiful person I’ve seen before…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words caused her heart to nervously beat like a small deer. She initially thought Chu Mu had said that just to console her, but now when she thought about it, Chu Mu had been very sincere when he said it. In fact, when he had said it, he had paused, not from meditation or insincerity, but because his character made it so…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the dawn’s light, Princess Jinrou’s faintly trembled and shone with a captivating luster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, she could feel like she was able to smell Chu Mu breath and his unique scent. But as a specter, she had no sense of smell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, she closed her eyes. Her long eyelashes formed a beautiful curve that was extremely captivating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed second by second. Princess Jinrou’s heart rapidly beated as she was somewhat anticipating, somewhat flustered, and somewhat bashful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after a while, there was still nothing on her lips. It was empty.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her heart also slowly calmed with time and the trace of flustered anticipation gradually turned to disappointment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did he still refuse to take the step towards her? Had she lost the chance of a lifetime?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought of this, Princess Jinrou felt bitter in her heart. This man had clearly said that he liked her in the Great Chu Family. But why did he maintain his distance from her after that? Why was it her that had to get close to him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought of what happened later, as well as the fact that only Ye Qingzi had a place in his heart, the bitterness in Princess Jinrou’s heart turned to tears that rolled down from her tight eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You said that you liked me, but got together with someone else. If you really liked me, why don’t you even have the courage to walk over to me. The only thing I need is someone who is sincere to me. But you were no different from a liar back then.” Princess Jinrou spoke the words in her heart through her closed eyes and tears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were in Tianxia City, she had been famous for her beauty being that of a fairy. Her pursuers were countless. However, of those countless pursuers, which one was actually sincere? There were all chasing after her looks; none of them had the courage or was willing to actually invest in pursuing her. Her requirements really were very low.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like when Chu Mu’s heart had thumped when he saw her for the first time on the deck of the boat, Princess Jinrou never treated Chu Mu as a nameless young man. His stubborn and resolved black eyes had also left a deep impression on her. Even after so many years, she still remembered them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thing called “feelings” really was strange and wonderful. Although Princess Jinrou didn’t know why she would remember a young man who had a Moonlight Fox with him on the deck of a boat, she firmly remembered him. Of course, all she did was remember…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After mustering up the courage to say those words, Princess Jinrou suddenly realized how stupid she was to say this aloud.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What right did she have to use what someone else had said when he was young and hot-blooded as a reason to blame him for future feelings. If she had to blame someone, she could only blame fate for not giving them more opportunities to understand each other. By the time she found out that this person really was her destined person, he already had a lover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. He never expected Princess JInrou to suddenly say this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought of those things of the past, Chu Mu really did feel that he was a coward back then. He had always thought too many things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Open your eyes first.” Chu Mu said to Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Princess Jinrou stubbornly said. She didn’t want to see Chu Mu taking pity on her. She would rather bury her confession and pride. After all, her own body wasn’t far from death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu bitterly laughed, “Princess, if you don’t open your eyes, how would you be able to tell if I’m like a coward who runs away?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You didn’t…” Princess Jinrou didn’t feel Chu Mu kiss her, meaning that Chu Mu had drawn back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Princess Jinrou suddenly realized that there was a big problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a specter. If she closed her eyes, regardless if Chu Mu kissed her or not, she wouldn't know....&nbsp;</span></p>
