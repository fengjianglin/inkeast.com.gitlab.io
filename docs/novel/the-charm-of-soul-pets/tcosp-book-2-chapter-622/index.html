Normally, only emperor rank wood type soul pets would have fifth rank wood crystallizations. Thus, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier being able to comprehend it at the peak monarch rank made Chu Mu’s smile even bigger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being able to possess wood type crystallization didn’t mean the Devil Tree Battle Soldier had emperor rank strength. However, it would allow it to be much stronger in the peak monarch realm as compared to soul pets that only possessed fourth rank wood type crystallization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Attribute crystallization was similar to demon beast type soul pets’ attacking weapons. The Devil Tree Battle Soldier comprehending pavilion wood was equivalent to a demon beast equipped with a tenth rank full form offensive soul equipment at the peak monarch rank. This greatly compensated for the diverse yet weak attacks of the Devil Tree Battle Soldier. Unless it encountered a fire type soul pet which countered plant kingdom soul pets, the Devil Tree Battle Soldier would be able to face even peak monarchs head on.</span></p>

It was even able to make a breakthrough with comprehension at such a crucial moment. Young master’s soul pets are truly resolved at improving!” Old Li laughed.</span></p>

The Devil Tree Battle Soldier’s evolution helped Chu Mu resolve a bit problem.</span></p>

Most importantly, it was also able to protect many people.</span></p>

The current problem is Western Marsh’s involvement and the fact that numerous people in the Chu Family still need your protection.” said Old Li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have a solution. Although it’s dangerous, I can still give it a try.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>

If there’s a small accident, all of us and the several tens of thousands of people inside Seven Color City will be dead!” Chu Tian firmly objected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young generation members were all seated there, ashen faced. They didn’t dare raise any objections.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, it had truly reached a time for the Chu Family’s choice. Earlier everyone had been discussing whether to hide in cellars and to wait for Western Kingdom to arrive with aid, or to cast aside a majority of the members and only let a small group of the Chu Family break out of the siege.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiding in cellars could only be used if the city hadn’t fallen into enemy hands yet. The moment the city fell, even if they were hidden in cellars, they would still be killed. After all, the powerful soul pets would be able to smell the scent of humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for having only a small portion of the Chu Family break out of the seize, the other 500 members of the Chu Family would be sacrificed. Thus the ones that survived would live in guilt. After all, it wasn’t everyone that had so-called “merciless tactics” in their heart. This was over 400 lives from one’s own family and over 30 thousand civilians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the choice, it was extremely difficult for the Chu Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Western Marsh legion will swallow up Seven Color City sooner or later. We definitely can’t save it. We can only change locations.” Chu Mu seriously said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Tianheng’s expression sank and for a while he didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone’s eyes were on Chu Tianheng. They all knew of the present situation and no matter the difficulty, they had to make a decision.</span></p>

There are 500 people in the Chu Family and 30 thousand people in Seven Color City without anywhere to go. Their life or death rests completely in your hands!” finally, Chu Tianheng spoke and his gaze fixed on Chu Mu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>

What he needed was Chu Tianheng’s complete faith in him; otherwise, if they were delayed at all during their migration, they would be completely wiped out.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merchant Alliance’s experts were all smart people. None of them wanted to be trapped here to death. If they joined the migration to protect Seven Color City’s people, things would be much safer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you joking?? You want to bring a few tens of thousands of people and make your way into the southern side’s leopard tribe? Has you mind broken?!!” Sun Yuan loudly cried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if I believe the fact that you have the assistance of an emperor rank soul pet and are capable of destroying the leopard tribe, I definitely cannot take this risk. The further south we go, the closer we are to the forbidden region. Finding an exit from there is suicide.” said Sun Pan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sun Pan was very disappointed because Chu Mu clearly didn’t plan on joining them as they broke the siege. Instead, he incredibly stupidly wanted to bring everyone from the city with him as he escaped this dangerous predicament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were over 30,000 people in the city. Such a large target, the moment they exited the city, would practically become a pile of fresh prey. Those savage and hungry creatures would definitely fight over them. Therefore, even if Sun Pan believed that Chu Mu had the assistance of an emperor rank soul pet, he definitely wouldn’t join Chu Mu’s plan. That would lead to an even more miserable death than Luo Region Sect’s people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The southern side doesn’t have the Western Marsh’s community. If we go in the opposite direction as them, this isn’t a bad idea. The fallen valley inside the leopard species territory with walls on all four sides is really much safer than Seven Color City. It’s a place of refuge. It’s a pity that this variable is too big. I admire your guts and your strength, but I can only wish you the best of luck.” said a young six remembrance spirit master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Mu glanced at this calm young man. He wasn’t as emotional as Sun Yuan when he talked. Clearly, this was a young man with judgement ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“SInce that’s the case, I’ll also wish you all good luck.” Chu Mu also knew that he had no way of begging them to join. This plan was predicated on their trust and immense courage to put one’s life at stake. The fact that they didn’t join was their own matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Sun Silong. I hope that we’ll have a chance to meet again in the future.” the young man called Sun Silong gave a faint laugh and expressed friendliness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The strength of Western Marsh’s legion isn’t inferior to a tribe. I estimate that they are going to occupy the entire Western Region soon. As for whether this situation occurs in other regions, I’m not sure. But you must be careful.” Chu Mu saw that Sun Silong was rather friendly and gave him a word of warning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Chu Mu finished speaking, the few people from Merchant Alliance revealed shocked expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before waiting for them to react, Chu Mu had already turned and left. For a moment they didn’t know if what Chu Mu had said was true or false.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, do you believe that he has the assistance of an emperor rank?” Sun Pan asked in a low voice.</span></p>

As for a first rank tribe surrounding Seven Color City, how is that possible?!”&nbsp;</span></p>

Moreover, does there exist a person with an emperor rank soul pet at that age?”&nbsp;</span></p>

He calmly replied: “There actually was someone in Tianxia Realm with an emperor rank soul pet whose age was only about 20.” &nbsp;</span></p>

That young man who obtained the Battle of the Realm’s first grade ultimate honor!!” Sun Pan abruptly reacted and let out a shocked cry!</span></p>

I heard that Chu Chen is an expert raised in secret by Soul Palace and is the same level of an existence as Soul Palace’s crown prince. How could he appear at such a small family. Even if they are both surnamed Chu, that doesn’t mean it’s him, right?” said Sun Yuan, who didn’t really believe it.</span></p>

If Western Marsh has reached the scale of a first rank tribe, then the entire Western Region will be occupied by them. With our strength, we may not be able to break out…”&nbsp;</span></p>

His other soul pets will probably not be of use. It will be too hard for him to eradicate the leopard tribe. The danger is too high. It’s best if we just stick to our own plan.”&nbsp;</span></p>

If Chu Mu wanted to protect everyone in Seven Color City, he naturally hoped that these people would join him. This was the case even if these fellows had previously proposed such rude and contemptuous requests for the Chu Family.&nbsp;</span></p>

They didn’t even let us know before they just fled like this! They even said to let them take charge of the city. If Seven Color City was governed by them, they would just flee the moment danger arose. The civilians in the city wouldn’t be able to survive!” Chu Lan who had followed Chu Mu began to let out a string of curses!</span></p>

Instead, he was like Ye Qingzi’s principle: he would save as many people until it meant he would be injured.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, their actions were really infuriating. It served them right that they were being used by Merchant Alliance’s people.&nbsp;</span></p>
