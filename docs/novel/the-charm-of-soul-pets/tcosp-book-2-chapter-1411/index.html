 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was night time. As he tossed and turned, Chu Mu was unable to fall asleep.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu wu wu~~~~~~~” Mo Xie lay on the window sill. Her thoughts were probably the same as Chu Mu’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whenever Chu Mu closed his eyes, he would see strange scenes. These scenes were scattered and had no sense of pattern behind them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the Monument Tear’s memories. However, what were they telling him...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inadvertently, Chu Mu thought of Imprint Valley’s imminent collapse. It seemed that the scattered Monument Tear memories in his head really did have something to do with the Seven Sins Fox. Each time he thought of the fact the Seven Sins Fox Light King could go extinct, an intense feeling surged in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong with me…” Chu Mu didn’t understand. Why had he been feeling very depressed lately? Perhaps the Demon Foxes really were related to the Heaven Boundary Monument and the species itself was something Monument Tear Individuals had to trace a source from. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo Xie.” Chu Mu opened his eyes and looked at Mo Xie on the window sill with her eyes half-open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie opened her eyes. Her silver pupils seemed particularly resplendent in the dark night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think we should take a trip to Imprint Valley?” asked Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu~” Mo Xie immediately nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Demon Fox herself, Mo Xie truly did care about the survival of her species. Moreover, the Seven Sins Fox Light king was a powerful opponent worthy of respect. Mo Xie hoped to be able to have a fight with it. If it were to go extinct from this world, that would be too unfortunate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But Imprint Valley is already closed. How could I get in there…” Chu Mu began to rack his brains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The opening and closing of Imprint Valley was in Divine Sect’s hands. Moreover, it seemed that they couldn’t open it any time they wanted. Thus, Chu Mu had to go ask Yu Suo, since she probably understood Imprint Valley’s situation very well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was late at night when Chu Mu arrived at Guang Moon Palace. As luck would have it, the one who met Chu Mu was the Evil Good Queen. She was using the moonlight to cultivate a few puppet flowers in Guang Moon Palace’s courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evil Good Queen’s alluring character made Chu Mu feel very uncomfortable, so he got straight to the point with her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evil Good Queen told him that the incantation was in Divine Sect’s hands. In the past when she entered Imprint Valley, she had been accompanied by Divine Sect members. If he wanted to enter, he would have to go through a Divine Sect member.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Chu Mu could only find Lin Mengling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was still late at night, but Chu Mu didn’t care if Lin Mengling was asleep or not. Once he arrived at Divine Sect, he immediately went to Jade Room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling seemed to be training. When she met Chu Mu in her pavilion, she was wearing a fine nightgown. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nightgown was a moon white color and her fair skin and the curves of her delicate body were faintly discernible. Lin Mengling may not have realized this herself, since nobody would come see her this late at night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, you really have no standards. Why are you coming here at this time? If someone else were to see, they would think there was something between us.” Lin Mengling feigned anger coquettishly as she spoke. It seemed a bit flirtatious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu and Xia Yin both firmly believed Lin Mengling was a devil woman; therefore, he turned a blind eye to her intentional flirtatious display.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is Imprint Valley about to collapse?” Chu Mu got straight to the point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Mengling was stunned. She stopped smiling and slowly nodded her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to enter Imprint Valley one more time.” earnestly said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you mad? That world may collapse at any moment. The spatial door that leads there is also extremely unstable. Why do you think they only let us train there for one year? It was because in one year, the spatial door to Imprint Valley would destabilize. After this lunar eclipse, it will be in an unstable phase, and there’s a chance that after you enter you will be unable to return.” said Lin Mengling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll come back out very quickly.” since Chu Mu had already made his decision, he was going to do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not a problem of when you come out. Currently, Imprint Valley is completely closed. It cannot be opened again.” earnestly said Lin Mengling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you have an incantation?” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, I know that you have special feelings for the Demon Fox species. But you already brought out those small Demon Foxes. You’ve done what you needed to do. That’s enough. Do you really think that the Seven Sins Fox Light King didn’t realize that its world was going to collapse?” said Lin Mengling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was stunned. The scene of the Light King lying in the small cave abruptly in his head. The Light King had seemed like it was an old man waiting for death. Its eyes were filled with a muddy dim without a trace of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did it already know Imprint Valley would be destroyed?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But why didn’t it leave? Didn’t it know that it was the last Seven Sins Fox Light King?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why didn’t it try to survive? Perhaps its next generation wouldn’t have to bear those heavy shackles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t help you. Only magistrate Xiao can open the spatial door behind the mountain. However, I’m certain that Magistrate Xiao will not open the spatial door again. He must consider the safety of Zhengming Main City’s citizens. Who knows how large of a destructive storm the collapse of an independent space will cause?” said Lin Mengling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving Divine Sect, Chu Mu seemed a bit preoccupied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was certain now that the Heaven Boundary Monument’s mystery had to do with the Seven Sins Fox. His current mood was fully a result of the imminent extinction of the Seven Sins Fox Light King</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t understand what was wrong. Normally, he would let nature take its course in these situations where he was powerless. However, this time he couldn’t let go. It was as if the moment the Seven Sins Fox Light King went extinct, he would be a criminal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s heart was a mess. He wanted to find someone to help him undo the problem gnawing at his heart. For a while, he didn’t know who to find. Both Liu Binglan and Ye Qingzi were in New Moon Land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I just return like this?” Chu Mu sat alone next to a pond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The day when spring turned to summer was about to arrive. Presumably, Liu Binglan and Ye Qingzi had prepared a grand wedding. This was something worth being happy about. However, the collapse of Imprint Valley was covering Chu Mu’s heart in a heavy shadow…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu wu~~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie lay depressed on Chu Mu’s shoulder. She clearly wanted to save the Light King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu looked at the calm pond and sunk into very deep thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some amount of time later, the moon was hanging on the horizon, and it was even later at night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was still sitting there like a statue. As his thoughts were flying, he didn’t notice a spectral blue colored clear soul appear behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beautiful long hair and a long white skirt from the waist flowing behind her. Her slim legs took careful steps. A pair of beautiful pupils that could intoxicate others flashed with a crafty glimmer…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She quietly floated up behind the statue and suddenly reached her two hands around Chu Mu’s neck. From behind, she tightly hugged him, wanting to give him a surprise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, her arms easily passed through Chu Mu’s body. She wasn’t actually able to hug Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t feel the hug from the beautiful specter. It wasn’t until the small Mo Xie let out a humph sound that Chu Mu realized. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu turned around and what met his eyes was a face so beautiful that it could make others forget their thoughts. Chu Mu was stunned for a few seconds…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jinrou, why… why are you here?” Chu Mu was both shocked and happy to see Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess JInrou stood in front of Chu Mu. Her small mouth was pouting, as she looked like she was sulking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m a ghost so I have certain abilities, for example being able to haunt someone after my death!” unhappily said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu didn’t know how to respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just now when I hugged you, you were like a blockhead. How detestable.” Princess Jinrou feigned anger coquettishly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although specters couldn’t touch normal peoples’ bodies, Chu Mu’s perceptive abilities were very strong. There was no reason he shouldn’t be able to perceive it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I was thinking of something,” explained Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What were you thinking of?” Princess Jinrou floated over to Chu Mu’s side. Her voice turned much softer because she could see that Chu Mu really was in a conundrum.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still haven’t told me why you’re here,” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I followed my father to the north. An old grandfather told us that the LImbo Flower is in the hands of an Immortal Teacher. This eccentric immortal teacher seems to be reclused in Xuan Gate Immortal School, so I came with my father to Zhengming Main City.” Princess Jinrou wore a thin smile as she spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Such an Immortal Teacher exists in Xuan Gate Immortal School?” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi had previously inquired to Old Madam Ying whether there was an immortal teacher with a revival method in Xuan Gate Immortal Sect. The answer she got was no. But then why did someone from the north say that such an immortal teacher existed in Xuan Gate Immortal Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure either. Perhaps it could be Wupan Continent’s Xuan Gate Immortal Sect.” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll send someone to find out.” Chu Mu nodded his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’re you sitting here alone for? Is there something bothering you?” asked Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu wanted to find someone to confide to. Bai Jinrou had come at the perfect time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Promptly, Chu Mu recounted his experience in Imprint Valley to Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Chu Mu’s words, Princess Jinrou was shocked. It was a while before she said: “The Heaven Boundary Monuments said that the strongest creatures were the Seven Sins Fox Light King and Dark King. Thus, this record on the northern side’s Heaven Boundary Monument has been verified!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” Chu Mu had only guessed this before. Now that Princess Jinrou gave a definitive answer, he had a bit of a realization.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Heaven Boundary Monuments were recounting the past of the Seven Sins Foxes, then as a Monument Tear Individual himself, he definitely needed to uncover the mystery behind the Seven Sins Fox’s sin shackles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His mood was probably affected by his identity as a Monument Tear Individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then Chu Mu, are you really going to enter Imprint Valley again?” asked Bai Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you remember the Heaven Boundary Monument saying ‘To those that have received favor, please return the favor’. Since the Heaven Boundary Monument has saved me once, &nbsp;I can’t just let it die.” earnestly said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I might be able to open the spatial door. However, I don’t want you to take the risk…” quietly said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a world that was on the verge of collapse. The mere thought of this was enough to make someone’s heart tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. I can control other type energy. Chaotic spatial streams don’t always have an effect on me.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll accompany you.” said Princess Jinrou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s out of the question.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s out of the question?” Princess Jinrou harrumphed and said, “I’m a very forgetful woman and for some reason I always forget a few of the steps to opening a spatial door.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“....” Chu Mu was speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
