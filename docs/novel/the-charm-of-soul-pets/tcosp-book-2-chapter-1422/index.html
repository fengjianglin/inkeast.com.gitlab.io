 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hades Hell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A technique that combined purple flames, demonic illusion and beast power. It was extremely difficult for an enemy to break free from Mo Xie’s Hades Hell. The enemy could only helplessly endure the burning heat from the surging flames!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space was completely twisted. Feng Xu and his Burning Nine-Headed Bird seemed to have fallen into an endless abyss that was filled with purple flames. No matter which direction they ran to, an endless purple hell laid before them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Burning Nine-Headed Bird had nowhere to escape anymore. Streaks of rampaging flames pounced on it. The Burning Nine-Headed Bird was unable to endure such intense heat despite possessing fire property.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Burning Nine-Headed Bird was desperately struggling while crying painfully. It recklessly tried to find the exit out of this hell. However, there was no exit in the Hades Hell, there was only an endless purple flame that burned crazily to the end of the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu’s face revealed the colour of fear over his astonishment. He could never have imagined that a careless mistake would land him in such a desperate situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu was usually the one who had to evaluate the fighting strength of his opponent as he was the captain. This Hades Hell’s continuous burning effect would eventually leave severe burns on his Burning Nine-Headed Bird. He did not have anything else left to oppose that Fox Noble in the following battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu was getting more and more anxious. However, he still could not find a way out of this scary technique that contained the property of demonic illusion. He could only watch helplessly as his soul pet suffered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu watched the shocking hell flame enveloping the sky. His Mo Xie did not disappoint him as expected after all. Next, Mo Xie would definitely not give that Burning Nine-Headed Bird any chance to recover and would finish off the battle as quickly as possible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Xie’s side had already been settled. On Little Hidden Dragon and Zhan Ye’s side, he heard a quarrel erupting between Li Huo and Lan Huo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhan Ye executed its fourth Broken Limb Rebirth, its strength had approached pseudo Immortal rank. Now, no matter how powerful that Flame Lion’s attacks were, Zhan Ye would be able to stand back up unscathed even after being hit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During those exchanges, Zhan Ye’s Ink Armor Spikes had dealt a severe amount of damage to the Flame Lion. Even if Zhan Ye did not truly advance into pseudo Immortal rank, the Flame Lion would no longer be a threat to it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhan Ye’s fighting strength was boosted, it did not only target Lan Huo’s Flame Lion anymore. It would occasionally jump into Little Hidden Dragon’s battle and help Little Hidden Dragon neutralize attacks from Li Huo’s Fire Phantom Ape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon had to endure attacks from two enemies simultaneously at the start and had suffered quite a number of injuries in the process. Now that it had finally endured to the point where Zhan Ye was able to be boosted, it naturally took a step back and let Zhan Ye take the brunt of the attacks unleashed by the two fire type creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Hidden Dragon also possessed insect property and had powerful regeneration ability. After it was able to take a breather, its injuries had rapidly started healing and it was able to gradually recover its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the heavily injured Spectral Hidden Dragon recovering, Li Huo became even more vexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the battle was no longer in their control. Zhan Ye’s savage and desperate attacks had forced them into a corner. Meanwhile, Little Hidden Dragon had also returned to the fray after it recovered some stamina and life force. Li Huo and Lan Huo began to fall into a panic, especially after seeing that Zhan Ye’s strength was still increasing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such were the creatures with insect properties. Li Huo and Lan Huo had probably never imagined that they were going to be suppressed by two enemies whom they could have finished off immediately!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Mu, that group of people will arrive soon,” Princess Jin Rou flew back to Chu Mu from her battlefield and reminded him worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou was the first to finish her battle, her enemy was only a single person controlling a fire type elemental creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu remembered that Princess Jin Rou was able to silence hundreds of elementals with a high pitched hymn. What use was an elemental soul pet if it could not perform an incantation in a battlefield?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Jin Rou had clearly used that special mental voice to suppress that fire elemental in this battle. That Hexfire member was never able to unleashed any high rank fire type techniques from the start, and was incapacitated due to mental damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, even if he could unleash any high rank fire techniques, Princess Jin Rou did not really possess a materialized form, so fire type techniques could not really inflict any damage to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I can sense them too,” Chu Mu took a glance at the warmly glowing Monument Tear in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another group of people arrived. There must be a Monument Tear Individual or a Fake Monument Tear Individual amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was unwilling to give up on the Seven Sins Fox Monument Tear in his hand. Thus, he would have to face a real battle between a Monument Tear Individual and a Fake Monument Tear Individual. He must not back off no matter how bloody it gets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s soul pets knew that the current battle was only a warm up. In order to readily intercept the next group of even more powerful enemies, they could not waste too much time on Hexfire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hui~!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night used Dark Dream Long Cry. The cry carried a powerful mental penetrating property and pierced right through the mental world of Lü Huo and Nü Huo’s soul pets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two soul pets howled in pain after suffering from a mental blow and fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lü Huo and Nü Huo no longer had the will to fight any longer. The non-stop nightmares had almost made them commit suicide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They hurriedly chanted incantations to retrieve their soul pets back into the soul pet space. When they saw that Night’s gaze on them, they recalled the creepy illusions in their minds and hurriedly ran away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night did not intend to let those two off easily. Its black pupils flashed and two black mental swords pierced straight through the heads of Lü Huo and Nü Huo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two continued to run for a few more steps, then spasmed uncontrollably after getting pierced by mental swords. They fell to the ground, unable to tell whether they were still alive or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lü Huo, Nü Huo!” Feng Xu saw the two fallen members and his eyes instantly turned bloodshot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was in danger himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long tails were wrapped around the nine heads of his Burning Nine-Headed Bird. The fox tails kept strangling and pulling on them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pssh! Pssh! Pssh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three heads were directly torn off first. Three bloody gashes had opened up on the Burning Nine-Headed Bird’s neck, blood flowing out profusely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu’s eyes were immediately dyed red. However, the fourth and fifth heads were torn off soon after!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pssh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the ninth head was finally torn off, the Burning Nine-Headed Bird was still recklessly flapping its wings in the sky, the nine gaps on the neck continued to bleed profusely. It was an extremely sickening sight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xu was utterly stunned. The Burning Nine-Headed Bird was his life achievement. Killing his Burning Nine-Headed Bird so cruelly was no different from killing him and then torturing his corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lü Huo and Nü Huo had fallen, Feng Xu lost, and Lan Huo and Li Huo had also lost their fighting spirit. Right at that moment, Zhan Ye had grown even stronger under the effect of its Brave Stinging Heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else had already failed. The two of them reacted immediately and recalled their soul pets before they also died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, the two of them quickly left the battlefield without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu had no room to pursue the two escapees right now. He would have to leave them alone if they wanted to escape, because he had to face yet another group of powerful people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what surprised Chu Mu was that before Li Huo and Lan Huo could escape any further, two huge clusters of burning flames descended from the sky and landed squarely on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Booom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clusters of flames exploded and swallowed them up whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the flames, Chu Mu could clearly see the two people and the escaping soul pets instantly turning into ashes, completely wiped out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was definitely not done by Chu Mu. When Chu Mu raised his head to check, he saw the woman who was fighting against the Martial Cloud Dragon levitating alone in the sky and coldly watching the two vaporized Hexfire members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That woman is so cruel,” said Princess Jin Rou gloomily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That woman even killed her own companion, she was not just simply cold-blooded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Huo turned around and then stared at Chu Mu. He could sense a trace of rage and grudge being directed towards him from that pair of ambitious and cold pupils!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will remember you. The item in your hands will be mine eventually!” fumed Madam Huo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Loose fiery robes, fiery red hair, in addition to the powerful soul remembrance of a Spirit Immortal rank, that woman’s aura was truly an astonishing person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu knew that Madam Huo was indeed a very powerful opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madam Huo immediately left after finishing those words. She recalled her fire type soul pets back into her soul pet space and left behind an afterimage of a burning flame trail in the horizon as she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flow was settled. Madam Huo had clearly suffered a disadvantage against the Martial Cloud Dragon. Otherwise, she would have attacked Chu Mu long ago. He could easily tell from her eyes that she was a woman who definitely will not give up until she achieves her objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many enemies this time, and Chu Mu was unable to clean them up completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, regardless of himself or the Martial Cloud Dragon, they really would not be able to keep the powerful Madam Huo from leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu raised his head and changed his focus in another direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, a few long dragons and serpents had gradually appeared in that direction. Their body sizes completely occupied a large patch of the sky and it looked very intimidating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the people from the Snake Dragon Faction,” said Princess Jin Rou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snake Dragon Faction was going to be stronger than Hexfire. At least, the Coiling Dragon Snake Formation that those snakes and dragons formed with Enforcer She in the lead could easily trap the Martial Cloud Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chu Mu encountered the Snake Dragon Faction in the past, he did not sense the existence of a Monument Tear Individual amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time however, be it the Seven Sins Fox Monument Tear or his own Monument Tears, both were glowing warmly. This meant that there was either a Monument Tear Individual or a Fake Monument Tear Individual amongst them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of which it was, the individual was without a doubt extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the dragons and snakes approaching from the sky, Chu Mu’s expression instantly turned stern.</span></p>
