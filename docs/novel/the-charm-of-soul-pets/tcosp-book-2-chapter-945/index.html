 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu’s words rendered the old hermit instantly speechless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nightmare Emperor Jiang also looked with shock at Chu Mu. He never expected this young man to speak so bluntly. It was indeed true that Nightmare Palace hadn’t seen a dominator rank expert in the last 100 years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Fangchen, do you really have the confidence to make our Nightmare Palace walk towards glory?” Nightmare Emperor Jiang looked at Chu Mu. For a moment, he didn’t understand why he would put the hopes of such a large faction in the hands of a young soul pet trainer. Could he have the courage of a king and dare to do what others did not?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Walking towards glory is your matter. I will only assist.” Chu Mu didn’t have such mighty ambitions. However, Chu Mu had thought of another method to take advantage of the resources in Nightmare Danger Ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Nightmare Emperor Jiang wanted was obviously assistance since he himself, was Nightmare Palace’s ruler. He didn’t want to give up his Nightmare Emperor position to someone else. Most importantly, his position wasn’t only decided by strength. One needed more to control all of Nightmare Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Close Nightmare Holy Region for 2 months. I want to train here for 2 months and tidy up Nightmare Danger Ground.” Chu Mu was very blunt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nightmare Ancestor had been killed by him and his White NIghtmare had emerged from the emperor rank, nearing the dominator rank. Thus, it was probably the strongest in Nightmare Palace; even if it wasn’t now, it would be in the future!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tidy up? How will you tidy it up?” the old hermit immediately asked, still worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your holy region’s Nightmare Empire has lost its king. It’s bound to become chaotic, which means that obtaining child Nightmares from here will be even harder. Give me two months and I’ll tidy it up. It will be extremely easy for you to obtain child pets in the future.” earnestly said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Fangchen, are you for real?” a light flashed through Nightmare Emperor Jiang’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of a faction was determined primarily by the supply of child pets. Nightmare Danger Ground was an extremely dangerous place, which meant that Nightmare Palace had to specially train a team of capturers to carefully enter Nightmare Dangerou Ground to search and bring back child pets. They would then have to split or reward these pets to Nightmare Palace’s members.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In one year, the average number of White Nightmares Nightmare Palace received was ten thousand White Nightmares, 500,000 Blue Nightmares, and 5-10 million Cyan Nightmares.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This number determined how much Nightmare Palace would develop that year. In the past few years, this number had significantly decreased. Adding on number of battles being fought which resulted in the death of numerous members, Nightmare Palace had indeed taken a huge blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order for Nightmare Palace to recover, the most direct method was to increase the supply of child pets. However, this supply all originated from Nightmare Danger Ground. According to the past few years though, it was unlikely that the supply could increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the senior elders and elders of Nightmare Palace met and discussed this, they would all crease their eyebrows, unable to find a solution. Nightmare Emperor Jiang himself would have his hair go white with worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, when Chu Mu said he had a method to tidy up Nightmare Danger Ground, Nightmare Emperor Jiang was naturally excited!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Fangchen, the Nightmare Ancestor is not the only one in charge of this Nightmare Empire. According to our records, the Nightmare Ancestor is only one of the kings in this empire. There are additional larger territories further in.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No problem. I’ll try my best to clear a wide area, or at least open up a wide enough area that it will be extremely easy for you to obtain child pets in the future.” Chu Mu nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, do you really believe that after devouring the Nightmare Ancestor, your White Nightmare will be the king here? These Nightmares all innately possess the blood of rebels. If you haven’t reached the dominator rank, it’s impossible to make them obediently listen. Moreover, tidying up a soul pet’s empire is merely just words. There has been no human until now that has had the arrogance to say he could tidy up this species.” coldly harrumphed the old hermit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What joke was he playing? It was only due to the thousand year history of their Nightmare Palace and their “pig pen” like protection of the holy region that they were able to use a portion of Nightmare Danger Ground’s resources. Countless generations of Nightmare Palace experts had spent a plethora of effort to slowly cultivate a saint pet “pig pen”. Yet, this twenty year old young man dared to say that he could reorganize the thousand year holy region in two months? Wasn’t this a joke?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old hermit didn’t know why Nightmare Emperor Jiang was so excited. He could ask any member, no matter how small, in Nightmare Palace, and they would all say that this was but a fool’s fantasy. Yet, here was a mighty Nightmare Emperor who believed in this fellow’s lies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Fangchen, this holy region isn’t as simple as you think. How about you tell me your method, and we’ll help you tidy it up.” Nightmare Emperor Jiang slightly came back to his senses after the old hermit’s words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu could see that Nightmare Emperor Jiang’s attitude towards him had greatly changed. His tone was more accommodating, and he was no longer like a big boss that didn’t believe anything he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just do as I say and wait two months.” Chu Mu couldn’t be bothered to pay heed to the old hermit’s cold words and tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Emperor Jiang, I think that we should just close this place for two months. Now that the Nightmare Emperor has died, Nightmare Empire will indeed be in a bit of chaos. It will be impossible for us to capture anything.” said Shen Qiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, Shen Qiu felt that Chu Fangchen, this brat, was reliable. Although he had just done something so heaven-defying, Shen Qiu still chose to trust this young man who always brought shock and surprise to others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, I’ll agree with you. If you truly can tidy up the holy region, you will become our Nightmare Palace’s Supreme.” seriously said Nightmare Emperor Jiang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Emperor Jiang, isn’t this too much of a child’s joke? Even disregarding the fact that completing this matter is impossible, do you believe that consecrating a young man as a Supreme will be accepted by the millions and millions of members in Nightmare Palace?” the old hermit was a bit anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s possible for the capable.” since Nightmare Emperor Jiang was willing to take this gamble, he wouldn’t hesitate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This brat could even get rid of the Nightmare Ancestor. Perhaps he would truly be able to tidy up the holy region into a new place within two months!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nightmare Emperor Jiang’s decision made Chu Mu see this Nightmare Palace ruler in a better light. As for that obstinate Old Hermit, he could just ignore him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group of people returned to Nightmare Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was a cultivation fanatic, and didn’t want to waste time. After returning to Soul Palace, he told Ye Qingzi that he wanted to train in Nightmare Holy Region for two months.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you need me to accompany you?” said Ye Qingzi, concerned. She knew that Nightmare Holy Region was a dangerous place and was a bit worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. Just focus on completing your concoctions, and I’ll bring you back a few Dark Fire Heavenly Devil crystals and soul crystals.” said Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi’s Dark Fire Heavenly Devil had been in the high class emperor rank for a while now. It had been unable to break through because it lacked the resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The best would be an emperor seventh or eighth rank. The more the better. I’ll refine them to the ninth rank, that way my Dark Fire Heavenly Devil will be able to reach the peak emperor rank.” said Ye Qingzi, entrusting him with this matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Peak emperor?” Chu Mu was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What did his woman want to do? Did she want to attempt to concoct a peak emperor rank soul crystal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the strongest soul teachers of the big factions could only concoct high class emperor rank spirit items on average. There were those like Zhu Chao that could concoct peak emperor rank spirit items, but they had to construct the foundations with expensive materials!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ye Qingzi said before that she wanted to concoct a peak emperor rank spirit item, Chu Mu thought that she was merely attempting to do so. He never thought that she would have the confidence to successfully do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If she actually succeeded, that would be incredible and she would be a peak emperor manufacturer!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?” Ye Qingzi saw Chu Mu’s fervent gaze on her. She thought that he was thinking of doing something improper and her face began to blush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu initially had no improper thoughts, but seeing Ye Qingzi’s accidental charm, Chu Mu’s heart moved and he pulled her soft body that one never wanted to let go into his arms. He kissed her smooth face and said: “Do you really understand how to concoct a ninth rank emperor rank spirit item?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ya, if I have enough materials…” Ye Qingzi nodded her head and softly buried her head in Chu Mu’s embrace, smelling Chu Mu’s lovely odor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu was overcome by a wave of happiness. It seemed that the matter of his Binding Wind Spirit, Devil Tree Battle Soldier, and Ghost King reaching the peak emperor rank would be solved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just as I said! Putting you and that girl Ning Maner together will create an emperor manufacturing machine.” Chu Mu cracked a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingzi was enjoying his embrace, but after hearing his words, she pursed her lips and stomped on the back of his feet. How could he compare her to something like that?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu let out an embarrassed laugh and asked: “Where did that unruly girl go?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She seems to have brought First White and them somewhere to play…” Ye Qingzi suddenly let out a giggle and continued, “I heard that Second Young Master has been eagerly accompanying Ning Maner, and it looks like he will soon become her attendant.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Mu bitterly laughed. He had heard of Soul Palace’s Second Young Master’s incompetence. Indeed, he was even able to play enthusiastically with that girl…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to bring First White with you?” asked Ye Qingzi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ya, I’m going to tidy up Nightmare Holy Region, but the Nightmare Empire is too large. I cannot do it alone. First and Second White both originate from the magnate in Southern Forbidden Region and both have the capabilities of a leader. If they follow me, we’ll be able to recapture Nightmare Holy Region.” said Chu Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was someone else, they would have said that Chu Mu was having a fool’s fantasy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ye Qingzi believed in Chu Mu’s abilities. Indeed, Ye Qingzi had personally witnessed this fellow lead a group of high ranking White Nightmares to trample on Xiangrong City!!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was just going to tidy up Nightmare Holy Region this time, he would probably go there to be called a king!&nbsp;</span></p>
