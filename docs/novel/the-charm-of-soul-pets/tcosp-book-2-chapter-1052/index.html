 <p>Lifting his head up, he saw a majestic city hiding in a hazy shroud of rain.</p>
 <p>The towering city walls stood imposingly. On the walls, people moved around</p>
 <p>Chu Mu followed the road forward and slowly walked forward. Gradually, he could see the tidy ranks of soldiers on either side of the road. They raised their arrogant heads as they watched mockingly at the last people to decide to surrender…..</p>
 <p>Every person walking into the city had heavy steps. Their thoughts were in shambles. Losing their stance, belief, and everything, they walked like living corpses. Even though they already stepped into the city gates, they still didn’t know whether this selection was right or wrong.</p>
 <p>“Yo, there’s one more, any slower and the execution will start. Surrendering then will be meaningless.” City gate general Wind Absolute said.</p>
 <p>Wind Absolute stood on the city gate. From his height, he could see a white clothed man slowly walk over.</p>
 <p>“You few, wait for that buddy of yours so I don’t have to tell people to go to the executioning grounds twice to cross off more names.” Wind Absolute glanced at the group of people surrendering at the foot of the city wall.</p>
 <p>The few people turned around to look at the white clothed man to see what kind of person he was.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, from the rainfog came a white organism that quickly went towards the white clothed man.</p>
 <p>“Is that an immortal ming bird?” a seventh level title middle aged man from soul palace said with some surprise.</p>
 <p>One could tell that it was an emperor rank immortal ming bird. The seventh level title man found it hard to believe that some executive of soul palace was also coming to surrender.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>In the rain, Chu Mu lifted his head and looked at the pure white soul pet that slowly floated down.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu, I knew it would be you!” Chao Lengchuan jumped off the Immortal Ming Bird, and said excitedly to Chu Mu.</p>
 <p>Seeing Chao Lengchuan fine, Chu Mu couldn’t help but smile. “I heard Shen Mo said you really got to be the hero once. However, it’s good to see you still alive, really.”</p>
 <p>“Compared to what you’re doing today, my courage before really wasn’t much.” Chao Lengchuan was as modest as ever.</p>
 <p>“You seem to be stronger.” Chu Mu felt that Chao Lengchuan’s soul remembrance grow stronger and also be wrapped in a special energy.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, just a lucky occurrence. Brother Chu, I, Chao Lengchuan had something to ask of you.” Chao Lengchuan said.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu nodded for him to continue.</p>
 <p>“I understand my mother’s character. No matter what, she will never surrender to Soul Alliance. If Brother Chu can shatter the executioner’s platform, I hope you can save her.” Chao Lengchuan said politely.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu was just about to agree when Chao Lengchuan’s tone suddenly became very serious. “Before that, unless I die, no one will touch a single hair of yours!”</p>
 <p>Chu Mu looked into the firm eyes of prince chao and was moved. After a long pause, he slowly nodded.</p>
 <p>Chao Lengchuan saw Chu Mu agree and felt more at ease.</p>
 <p>He knew that as long as this man agreed, then he would try his absolute best to complete it. As long as he agreed, Chao Lengchuan was comfortable putting his life in his hands!</p>
 <p>Chu Mu and Chao Lengchuan were just about to go further ahead when further chasing came from behind them. In a moment, a man flipped handsomely off a star wilderness devil colt and caught up to Chu Mu and Chao Lengchuan.</p>
 <p>“Haha, from far away, I heard your voices. What a coincidence. Though I’m useless in front of dominator ranks, as long as I, Ye Wansheng, am here, the sixteen absolutes, eight desolation people won’t get to interrupt your heroic act. Of course, if I can’t beat them, I’ll still retreat.” Ye Wansheng laughed and said.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu glanced at Ye Wansheng and was just about to speak when he continued calmly, “Don’t forget, I still owe you half my life.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Chu Mu knew that he couldn’t stop Ye Wansheng’s decision anymore.</p>
 <p>However, the battle was no longer him fighting alone!</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>“Stop being slow, if you don’t want your family to die then climb up quickly!!” Wind Absolute stood on the city wall, and yelled at the three of them lagging behind.</p>
 <p>“Report your name and identity!” Wind Absolute said impatiently.</p>
 <p>The three walked to the bottom of the wall. Only Ye Wansheng lifted his head, replying with a smile, “My name is Ima, last name Hoare.”</p>
 <p>“Ima Hoare, what a bizarre name.” Wind Absolute cursed and was just about to ask for the others' titles when he suddenly realized what he had just said, and turned cyan in anger!</p>
 <p>“Capture these bastards!” Wind Absolute yelled out angrily.</p>
 <p>After giving the command, the armies both in and out of the city all surrounded them.</p>
 <p>Though most people who came to hand over surrender letters were emissaries, there were some higher level people who came themselves to surrender. To prevent these people from going berserk, there were quite a lot of troops outside.</p>
 <p>Immediately, there were three circles of people around them staring at them viciously.</p>
 <p>Ye Wansheng maintained his smile. When Chao Lengchuan and Chu Mu just walked into the vicinity of the city, they didn’t even lift their heads, choosing to continue emotionlessly.</p>
 <p>“Bastards, I, your grandfather, am here to put you in your graves!” Ye Wansheng indeed had no mercy in his language, setting the entire army into anger with a single sentence of his.</p>
 <p>“Chop him up!” Wind Absolute was even more furious. A failure daring to be this arrogant was truly just looking for death!!</p>
 <p>After giving the command, a beast uproar sounded. Hundreds of beast type soul pets pounced forth, threatening to rip the three of them into pieces.</p>
 <p>Ye Wansheng’s Star Wilderness Devil Colt lifted its forepaws, and heavily slammed them down towards the city bridge!!</p>
 <p>“Beng!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The bridge snapped and shook. With the stamp, the hundred beast type soul pets all went flying, crushing a large part of the army behind them. As for those who were at the forefront of the charge, they were directly crushed by the stamp’s power!</p>
 <p>Shrieks sounded all over. The army was rendered into bushels of wheat as they flew out through the air in a mess under the might of the star wilderness devil colt’s multiple stomps. Falling into other people, into the city wall, falling into the city moat, they were all flimsy!</p>
 <p>Wind Absolute’s face instantly blackened as he was standing on the city wall. He didn’t expect this young man to be a top tier emperor rank expert. Looks like he had to fight himself!</p>
 <p>“How about the other two?” Wind Absolute was just about to attack when he noticed the other two were gone.</p>
 <p>“Boss, they entered the city already.” Sub commander ran to the other side of the wall and pointed at the two figures who kept going forth without cease.</p>
 <p>Wind Absolute’s entire face was twitching.</p>
 <p>These two people never even looked over at them a single time from beginning to end. They took no one seriously. This was truly a display of how little they cared for anyone there!!!</p>
 <p>Wind Absolute was livid. Not only did the city gate he watched over get in trouble, two people even got in unauthorized. Even worse was the two seemingly just strolled in!</p>
 <p>“Surround them!!” Wind Absolute roared as he quickly started an incantation too.</p>
 <p>“Other than yelling your head off, what else can you do?” Suddenly, a cold laugh came into Wind Absolute’s ear.</p>
 <p>Wind Absolute suddenly turned his head around just to find the man who previously insulted him now right in front of him. The star wilderness devil colt he rode was now a more powerful Multi Colored Devil Tiger!!</p>
 <p>“Paragon...paragon emperor rank!” Wind Absolute was shocked. Paragon emperor rank aura coming caused Wind Absolute’s incantation to be interrupted, yet he had no time to redo it anymore.</p>
 <p>“I heard Wind Absolute was the worst of the sixteen absolutes, looks like they were right.” Ye Wansheng smiled ruthlessly and gave a command!</p>
 <p>“Shua!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Devil Tiger’s claw fell down onto the Wind Absolute’s head. Before the Wind Absolute could cast anything, he was ripped into two by the paragon emperor rank tiger, sloshing blood everywhere.</p>
 <p>“Hong!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The same time Wind Absolute was ripped in half, the entire towering city wall was collapsed by a large tiger claw mark, pushing the structure itself down!</p>
 <p>The outer city building was a hundred meters tall. To normal soul pet trainers, it was like a mountain. Yet, with one attack of the Multi Colored Devil Tiger, it collapsed. The soldiers posted around the city building all held their heads and fled frantically!</p>
 <p>“Honghong!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>The building finally fell completely. A wave of turbidity lifted up in the rain. Blood leaked from between the ruins as corpses were scattered throughout.</p>
 <p>In a moment, the outer city defending army was shocked. They started shivering as they watched the man smile as he walked by with his Multi Colored Devil Tiger.</p>
 <p>This time, no one dared to stop him. They could only watch as this man slightly quickened his pace to catch up to the two people who walked ahead…….</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>“The middle city will probably be more difficult, right?” Ye Wansheng turned around to glance at the ruined walls and rain-washed blood.</p>
 <p>“At least a desolation ranked expert.” Chao Lengchuan said.</p>
 <p>Chu Mu nodded. “Such small destruction won’t even raise their attention.”</p>
 <p>“Speaking of which, we have four or five thousand people around us, should we clean them up first?” Ye Wansheng looked around.</p>
 <p>The streets had long since been densely surrounded. Even the little alleyways alongside the main road were packed with people. This lower rank army’s average strength was warrior rank, most of them posted within outer city.</p>
 <p>After Ye Wansheng created such a large commotion, a scar level expert immediately moved troops over, pushing their numbers over five thousand!!</p>
 <p>The massive group of people stood in the rain, watching the three of them as their greatest enemies.</p>
 <p>However, none of them dared enter the fifty meter radius around these three people!!</p>
 <p>“Let me do it.” Chu Mu said calmly.</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he gave Mo Xie on his shoulders a glance.</p>
 <p>Mo Xie nodded and leaped off his shoulder. Her demonic pupils suddenly reflected a phantom world, a world where a single flame of fury was burning silently!</p>
 <p>Ye Wansheng was about to deal with these troops himself, but upon seeing Mo Xie’s pupils, he slowly showed surprise.</p>
 <p>Soul Alliance soldiers looked shakily at the strangely attracting pupils and, unknowingly, the nearest ring of soul pet trainers near Mo Xie gained a flame of anger within their eyes as well…...</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</p>
 <p>Species Calamity!!!</p>
 <p>What else was better than this technique to defeat enemy forces?</p>
