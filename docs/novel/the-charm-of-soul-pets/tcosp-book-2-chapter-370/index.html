The moment the Centipede Tail Boulder Devil began to fall back down, the curved sword smashed into its skull, causing the skull to explode in midair!!&nbsp;</span></p>

A large portion of the low level dark crystal rock on its body had been shattered, and it resembled a brown boulder that had been blown up!</span></p>

At this moment, the New Hunting King was completely stunned. The Ghost King’s series of attacks had most directly displayed the difference between a true monarch and the pseudo monarch of the Centipede Tail Boulder Devil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Centipede Tail Boulder Devil’s skull had been shattered and, although this wouldn’t kill it, it had completely lost the strength to fight and lay on the ground without the strength to even crawl back up. In such a fight where one couldn’t switch soul pets while fighting, the moment a soul pet lost the strength to fight, winning would become extremely hard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire audience went deathly silent. For a long time, there was no discussion. In front of an absolute display of strength, this silence was even more capable of expressing their shock at this violent monarch!</span></p>

Having his confidence severely beaten, he grit his teeth and hastily chanted an incantation. He wanted to recall the Centipede Tail Boulder Devil into the soul pet space while simultaneously summoning his third pet!</span></p>

Of everyone present, only he had remained calm as he had already expected the Ghost King to have such powerful strength!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of Li Hen’s mouth rose. He didn’t explain any further to these fellows and instead stood up and walked towards the battlefield.</span></p>

This happened to be the existence of the Night Thunder Dream Beast which had a powerful concealment ability!</span></p>

Immediately, its black sharp-blade like mental blades attacked like a violent storm and violently attacked Luo Peng’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Peng’s incantation was interrupted by the Night Thunder Dream Beast’s technique and his mind was also pierced by the sharp black swords. He let out a painful howl!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wind Dragon Bind was a low rank wind type technique and the Hurricane Fairy didn’t need to chant when it used it. Enduring the pain of having his mind pierced, Luo Peng was sure that, in the next moment, the loathful demon would be fiercely swept away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the pain from mental piercing continued; this one second was incomparably long to Luo Peng, and by the time he discovered from the corner of this eye that the Ghost King had already appeared in front of him, Luo Peng finally abruptly realized that his Hurricane Fairy hadn’t used the technique!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurricane Fairy?” a huge wave of emotions surged in Luo Peng’s heart. When he tried to connect with the Hurricane Fairy using his mind, he fell into complete despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A nightmare realm had completely filled the Hurricane Fairy’s consciousness. Luo Peng himself didn’t even know at what time Chu Mu’s Night Thunder Dream beast had used the Dream technique on his Hurricane Fairy that completely inhibited it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is this possible?! How is this possible?! How could this Night Thunder Dream Beast get to my soul pet when I didn’t even detect it?!!” Luo Peng had been driven mad. Due to the pain of having his mind pierced and his confidence instantly shattered, his face became distorted!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s an eighth phase seventh stage Night Thunder Dream Beast. From the very beginning you looked down on your opponent, so how could you detect the existence of a soul pet which is most adept had concealing itself.” Li Hen had already walked onto the battlefield and indicated that Chu Mu didn’t have to continue fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eighth phase seventh stage!!”</span></p>

He remembered back then the Night Thunder Dream Beast had only been at the seventh phase ninth stage. Even if it used spirit items to strengthen itself, it would have only been able to rise to about the eighth phase fourth stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ting Lan’s eyes which were always as calm as the water also revealed a shocked expression. Eighth phase high stage. This Night Thunder Dream Beast’s strength increase was too terrifying, wasn’t it? One had to know that even Ting Lan had a few soul pets that were still stuck at the eighth phase high stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How on earth did he increase its level? Could it be that he spent this entire time fighting?” Ting Lan muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit items could increase a soul pet’s phase and stage, but a soul pet ultimately had to fight in order to unceasingly surpass itself. The only way one would be able to level up a soul pet from the seventh phase ninth stage to the eighth phase high stage in such a short period of time was through fighting without break. Moreover, it definitely had to be fighting those stronger than oneself because only by challenging creatures a higher phase and stage than itself could the most of its potential be stimulated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unconsciously, Ting Lan grew even more curious about this mysterious Chu MU.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Defeat!</span></p>

The entire course of events didn’t even last that long!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few months ago, Luo Peng felt that his strength was comparable to Chu Mu’s, only that his usage of soul pets was inferior to Chu Mu’s. In this period of time, he had doubled his requirements for himself and continuously trained in the bewildering world in hopes that he would be able to rely on hard work to surpass Chu Mu who had made him feel humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, the situation turned out completely different from what he had expected. Not only had he failed to beat Chu Mu, the difference in strength with Chu Mu had grown even wider; moreover, he no longer was an opponent on the same level as Chu Mu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mere few months of time, yet his strength had increased so quickly. Then, in another half a year, wouldn’t he stand at a height that he would have to look up to? Where on earth did such a person come from? Why had he been in Tianxia City for so long but had never heard of Soul Palace’s Chu Chen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master Chu is much stronger than Li Hen when I was your age. This subordinate came this time to talk with you about ultimate honor of the third grade. With the strength Young Master Chu has displayed, there probably aren’t many people who have the qualifications to compete with you.” lauded Li Hen to Chu Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Hen was already very happy with this young master beforehand. After witnessing his fight, he looked at the Young Master Chu who had walked out of the most dangerous area of an eighth rank bewildering world with even more respect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not interested in the third grade honor.” Chu Mu shook his head and recalled the Night Thunder Dream Beast and Ghost King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, why is that?” Li Hen silently felt confused. As a young generation expert, there was no reason not to participate in the Battle of the Realm. The third grade’s ultimate honor was something that countless people would be willing to embark down the bloody path of becoming an expert in order to obtain this ultimate proof of authority!</span></p>

He was unreconciled, absolutely unreconciled. This clearly was a young man whose strength wasn’t very different than his, so having to watch him walk towards even higher strength levels was something he couldn’t do!</span></p>

I will definitely step on you and obtain victory!” Luo Peng’s entire face was flushed red as evidently, his emotions had reached their limit!</span></p>

This little bit of ability has no qualifications to shout and scream in my Soul Palace!” Li Hen creased his brows. What he hated the most was people who didn’t understand their own circumstances. In his opinion, since he had been defeated, he should have obediently shut his mouth, gone back to wherever he should go back to, properly reflect there and continue to work hard instead of shouting and screaming here!</span></p>

What does a fight between the young generation have to do with you?!” Luo Peng had already lost a bit of control as he angrily spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Peng had his own middle age experts who supported him at the Hunting Association, so even if he was in front of Li Hen, this Soul Palace expert, he simply didn’t fear him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Peng had just jumped into the battlefield from the audience when he suddenly heard Luo Peng’s words. Instantly, he began to break into a cold sweat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing those words, Li Hen’s entire being immediately turned icy cold. His eyes were like icy sharp swords that pierced into Luo Peng’s eyes. Abruptly, a terrifying and vicious aura filled his entire body!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Hen’s entire body began a piece of frosty ice and his eyes became imposing. This aura of strength was much more powerful than that of Soul Alliance’s Qin Ye that he had encountered back then!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll give you one day to bring your teacher of elder to Soul Palace!” LI Hen’s voice was even able to lower the surrounding temperature!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An expert!!</span></p>

He never expected that this subordinate of Palace Lord Yu to have such a powerful grandeur!! He absolutely was an expert that would garner the respect of others!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Li Hen, Senior Li Hen, Luo Peng is young and hot headed. Please don’t blame him. Please calm down, please calm down…” Wang Xu was so scared his face was pale. As a second grade expert, even he didn’t have the least bit of drive at this moment and was completely like a lowly peasant!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Li, just leave it. He just couldn’t control his emotions for a moment.” at this point, Ting Lan’s voice slowly rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Peng stood there stunned. A cold sweat was breaking out on his body like water and had completely soaked his clothes.&nbsp;</span></p>

His entire being had been filled with terror and even his soul was shaking!! Luo Peng had the support of Hunting Association experts, but of all the people he recognized, none of them had reached the level of the man in front of him!!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scram!!” coldly said Li Hen. Li Hen seemed to only be about thirty years old, but he no longer cared about fights between the young generation. However, if a young person who thought he was hot stuff kept on jumping about, Li Hen wouldn’t mind teaching a lesson to the person backing this young man as well to prevent people from forgetting his name!!&nbsp;</span></p>
