This is the territory of the other species - the Ocean species, the Demon species, the Beast species, the Ghost species, and the Flower species. These great species are not inferior to the power of us humans.” said Family Master Ning. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shocked cry rang through the villa’s great hall while the stunned expressions indicated how surprising such information was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Binglan suddenly remembered something when she heard this. She opened her spatial ring with Chu Mu’s letter that Pang Yue had brought and opened it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the letter, Chu Mu had said he needed to do a few things in the Ocean species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was the Ocean species he was speaking about the same as the Ocean species Family Master Ning said had a civilization like humans?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, Liu Binglan thought that the Ocean species Chu Mu was speaking of was a particular soul pet species in the ocean region. Thinking about it now, Chu Mu was definitely in the Ocean species civilization.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how had Chu Mu come into contact with the Ocean species members?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Family Master Ning finished telling them this, he didn’t say anything more. He knew that it would be difficult for these new people to accept this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was the reality. When Family Master Ning had first learned of this information, his facial expression hadn’t been much more calm than these people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Family Master Ning had underplayed some of the facts because humans were actually lacking a bit compared to these five great species!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then may we ask Family Master Ning what kind of coexistence method do we use with these great species? Why have we not known about them in the past, nor have we seen any of the creatures from other civilizations?” asked a young gate master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a good explanation for this. The other civilizations are all soul pets, so even if you have seen creatures from other civilizations, in your eyes, they are but a soul pet. Just like how soul pets do not understand our civilization, we do not understand them. It’s not that you haven’t seen them before, but that you are unable to communicate with them.” said Family Master Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If that’s the case, how do your sirs and madams from the royal families know about the existence of these civilizations? Could it be that you have some method to communicate with these species?” another person asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Family Master Ning didn’t respond to this question. Instead, he glanced at Hidden Pupil Royalty’s old family master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hidden Pupil Royalty’s old family master calmly replied: “The five great species have their own envoys and most of these envoys are half pet half human. They have very high intelligence like us and have a natural ability to imitate language and thoughts. If the five species want to communicate something to us humans, they will have their emissaries negotiate with us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Half human half pet? Could he be referring to half human types?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this question was posed, many people looked at Bai Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many that knew of Bai Yu’s half human identity. After finding out about the shocking truth from Family Master Ning, these people began to suspect whether Half Devil Bai Yu was an envoys from other species civilizations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Half humans are not envoys. There is a slight human lineage mixed into the bloodline of foreign envoys. However, they are mainly of a foreign species.” Family Master Rong spoke out at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only after Family Master Rong’s explanation did everyone move their strange gazes from Bai Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were a few people whose interests were piqued. King Ning looked with interest at Bai Yu and asked: “Mister Bai, if you can transform into a devil, doesn’t that mean you should be able to freely communicate with the Nightmare species. Thus, aren’t you able to move freely in the Sequence Lands at the Edge of the World?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people knew that aside from the five great species were some other soul pet species with extremely powerful strength. This included the Nightmare species in the Sequence Lands. They were also existences extremely feared by humans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. They do not welcome me.” calmly said Bai Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thankfully, us humans are accepting of you,” sarcastically said Elemental Sect Wind Faction’s faction lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are some people that shouldn’t rashly consider me as a human,” calmly replied Bai Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wind Faction’s faction lord went pale. He never expected that Bai Yu dared talkback!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were so many leaders sitting here so Wind Faction’s faction lord couldn’t say too much. He could only swallow his anger and say in a voice only he could hear: “Just wait and see!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have a few agreements with these great species and under normal circumstances, no large-scale war will break out.” continued Family Master Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans often had disasters, but most of these disasters were caused by soul pet dynasties. These soul pet dynasties were probably much weaker than the entire Human species or the other five great species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, if a war were to break out between the five great species and the HUman species, it couldn’t be described as a disaster. Instead, it would probably be a calamity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Today, we’ll first discuss the matter about Quiet Forest’s Stronghold construction. There are a few subsidiary species of the Beast species civilization which are not abiding by the restrictions. They have begun to frequently wander into Wupan Continent’s northwestern borders territories. Who are the border lords of this area?” asked Family Master Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, four Border Lords stood up and bowed at Family Master Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only these large affairs that threatened humanity’s existence would appear in the Dual Earth Conference. Quiet Forest’s current situation was growing increasingly messy. If the Beast species civilization really existed, then Quiet Forest Stronghold essentially bordered right on their territory. Thus, the serious disasters they were suffering from now were coming from the Beast species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter is occurring in Wupan territory, but since it concerns the safety of all of humanity, I’m sure every member present has a duty to help.” Family Master Ning swept his eyes over the 200 people present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These 200 people represented humanity’s most powerful figures. It was no exaggeration to say that the lives of billions of humans were in their hands. Thus, they absolutely had the ability to influence the rise and fall of a huge species matter like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We will recruit a few experts from each of your factions to go to Quiet Forest. If someone is individually named, I hope they won’t refuse… is everyone in agreement?” said Family Master Ning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Family Master Ning’s gaze looked at everyone present again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy to refuse a royal family master, especially when the matter concerned the entire Human species. If they weren’t to agree, it would be equivalent to betraying the entire species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, no one said anything. It didn’t matter which faction it was, they could only abide by the royal familys’ arrangements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I oppose this.” suddenly, a cold and low voice rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment this voice rang out, the conference abruptly descended into silence as everyone turned to see who dared refuse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xueang ignored these people’s gazes and calmly looked at Family Master Ning as he said: “Whoever were the ones that committed this offense should be the ones to bear the consequences. There’s no need for others to take responsibility for their greed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking, Xiao Xueang intentionally looked at a few people in the leader seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also don’t like cleaning up after someone else’s mess,” said King Ning from the Ning Family Dynasty in a very frank manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was also surnamed Ning, King Ning of the Ning Family Dynasty wasn’t abiding by the royal family Family Master Ning’s wishes. This confused people. Weren’t these two great figures supposed to be from the same place?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Having everyone else take responsibility for someone else’s wrong… isn’t this inappropriate, Family Master Ning?” Xuan Gate Immortal Sect’s old sect master also spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Probably only these leader rank figures dared speak opposing words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Family Master Ning’s expression didn’t change while his eyes looked questioningly at the other family masters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other family masters faintly nodded their heads, indicating that since a few leaders opposed this, they couldn’t deal with this matter in that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s leave this for now,” said Family Master Ning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The casualties from Wupan Continent’s eastern extreme bug plague have been sent to everyone already. This boog plague appeared ten years ago and has swept through practically every city with humans living it in the eastern extreme. The number of people who have become infected or ill is countless and it is continuously growing. The border kingdom lords in the area and Xuan Gate Immortal Sect have been unable to find an effective countermeasure. If nobody else has a better method, we can only send an army to clear up everyone infected by the bug plague and stop it from spreading.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wupan Bug Plague was a horrifying bug epidemic from Wupan Continent’s eastern side. This stubborn plague had existed for too long. It also had hidden and infectious effects. If it was not well controlled and spread to even larger cities, it was unknown how many people would lose their lives. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There had been disaster level epidemics in history that had caused humanity’s total population to plummet a few tenths and the Wupan Bug Plague was trending in that direction!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sending an army to exterminate them? Isn’t this too inhumane? The negative repercussions caused by this will be too big.” said Divine Sect’s female gate master. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then does Divine Sect have a better way of dealing with this?” asked Family Master Ning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female gate master didn’t know how to respond for a moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she suddenly seemed to think of something and her eyes looked at the special faction seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She stood up and gave a light bow before saying: “Guang Moon Palace’s Saintess Yu has particular understanding in flower type blessing techniques. Perhaps she has a method of dealing with this plague?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Family Master Yu faintly raised his brows, and stared at the Saintess Yu the female gate master had spoken of.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu was wearing a veil and was sitting there like a fairy. She had a tranquil and divine aura that resembled a beautiful and tender celestial mountain snow lotus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female Gate Master’s recommendation made everyone look at Saintess Yu. When they saw her, many people silently sighed. They never expected such an outstanding and stunning woman would appear in this conference. Even with the veil, she still gave everyone a free and melodious feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guang Moon Palace Saintess Yu, do you have a method of neutralizing the plague?” after Family Master Ning examined Saintess Yu, he asked her a question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Saintess Yu calmly laughed, seeming elegant and reserved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t understand much about Wupan Continent’s matters, but I can give the bug plague a go.” Saintess Yu’s voice melodiously and beautiful rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young lady, how confident are you?” the Ning Family Dynasty’s King Ning turned around and asked with a rarely seen serious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Until now, I haven’t encountered an epidemic I cannot cure.” faintly smiled Saintess Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” King Ning showed a pleased expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Ning, Saintess Yu has cured no less than 20 immortal rank plagues in our Zhengming Continent. The number of people she has saved can be counted in the hundreds of millions. Every holiday, the people who come to Guang Moon Palace to thank her are always lined up from Guang Moon Palace all the way outside the inner city… you can be reassured about the saintess’s abilities.” Xuan Gate Immortal Sect’s old sect master stroked his beard as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, that’s very good. Once the conference is over, I will trouble Saintess Yu to take a trip to my Wupan Continent.” said King Ning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">King Ning’s personal invitation was a supreme honor!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody expected that Guang Moon Palace’s Saintess Yu would suddenly receive such generous treatment!&nbsp;</span></p>
