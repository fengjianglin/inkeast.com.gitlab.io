 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whoooo….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton sighed exhaustedly in his room after the banquet was over. He had no idea how many young ladies he had danced with. And as for his disappointment in the ladies who had tried their best to initiate bodily contact with every dance…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That was great. What a catch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nope, there was no such disappointment. It’s not like he’s a hero in a romance novel who considers all females as rocks until the heroine comes along. How could Milton not like his popularity with the women when he was single? With a clenched fist, Milton recalled all the young ladies he had met today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Although the portraits were all exaggerated and a scam, they were still quite beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looks-wise, the aristocratic young ladies were all above average. This was because, in most cases, the mothers would all be very beautiful, so the young ladies all had a genetic advantage. Not to mention, the aristocratic ladies all paid attention to their faces and took special care, unlike the commoners. For a good match, not only is the family prestige important, but the beauty of the person was equally important.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many young ladies often dream of a man of higher status falling in love at first sight with their beauty and marrying them. Of course, the man in their dreams is handsome, powerful, and above all, only loves her. They were basically imagining a Cinderella story where they were the main character, but it’s not like it never happens. There have been cases where the young lady wields her beauty as a weapon and marries way above her station. So it’s natural for them to have an above-average beauty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Well, there’s no one as beautiful as the Charlotte Merchant Company’s head. But then, her beauty wasn’t that of a human but that of a fox spirit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anyways, in Milton’s life, no, not even in Park Moonsoo’s life, he has never been this popular with beautiful ladies before. How could Milton not enjoy the peak of his life when it came running to him like this?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shall I start meeting with them one-on-one tomorrow? The first person should be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton smiled happily as he recalled the shortlist of candidates in his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700">The day after the banquet</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Instead of returning to their own territories, many of the nobles continued to stay in the&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Territory. All of them had one thing in common, they all had daughters. In order to match their daughter to Milton, the nobles spared no effort. Thanks to that, Milton was able to meet one beautiful young lady per day. During the meetings, Milton carefully considered which of those ladies would be decent enough to marry. And so, ten days passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They all kinda suck.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton sighed after meeting ten women in ten days. He wasn’t trying to be picky. He thought it’d be easy to pick a suitable wife since there were so many candidates. But once he had met them personally, such thoughts disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I want to tell the people in Korea who call women gold-diggers to come and live here.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was a completely different level. They all pretended to be modest at the banquet hall, but it was all a lie. Is it because they think that since Milton was meeting with them privately, he must have feelings for them? They quickly showed their true colors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One woman subtly hinted that she didn’t want to spend her entire life in the country, so they should quickly move to the Capital. Another woman was pretentious and thought she was better since her family was more traditional.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the worst one was the woman Milton had met yesterday. Every action she made revealed just how arrogant she was. The most decisive factor was when the serving maid accidentally broke the plate and dirtied her dress. She immediately slapped the serving maid across the face in front of Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then calmly spoke…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Since there is no Lady in the house, the servants naturally have no respect. Do not worry, My Lord, I will correct that.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Full of pride as though her actions had been correct.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Truly eye-opening. She’s vain but doesn’t have basic manners. That’s what it is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how much Milton thought about it, he just couldn’t get married to such women. He’d much rather live as a bachelor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t help it. It’s not that I’m not marrying, it’s that I can’t marry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Muttering to himself, Milton decided to forget about marriage for the time being.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, a guest has come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A guest? Didn’t I say I won’t be seeing anyone today?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After dealing with vain aristocratic young ladies, Milton had wanted to forget about everything and just take a break.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is… Young Lady Philinover says she really wants to see you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton couldn’t help but curse. He was tired and annoyed, and now there was a woman who was forcing her way in…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell her I’m tired today and can’t meet with her.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton sent his chamberlain back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A while later…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, as she left, Young Lady Philinover asked me to pass this on to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not sure what it is, My Lord. She asked that I deliver it to you and then left.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The chamberlain was holding several large paper scrolls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s too big to be a letter. Wonder what it is.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Intrigued, Milton decided to check its contents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Here, give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton received the scrolls from the chamberlain and opened them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is… a blueprint?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Blueprints were drawn on the scrolls. And they weren’t just ordinary blueprints either.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t this a blueprint of our territory?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at the drawings, even Milton, who knew nothing about civil engineering, was able to see at a glance that it was almost professionally done.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“City planning, outer wall extension, port development, and road planning?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The blueprints were either what was currently being worked on or what must be done for the development of Forrest Territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Who did you say delivered these?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The daughter of Baron Philinover delivered them, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Philinover? Philinover… Philinover… Ah! Is it that person?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After muttering the name a couple of times, Milton was able to remember meeting Baron Philinover during the banquet. Amongst the nobles who had attended the banquet, Baron Philinover a newcomer. He had been active in the Capital until moving to the Southern Region three years ago. Although the exact reason was unknown, it’s said that when a noble from the Capital moves down South, it means that the family has collapsed. He had also invested the least amount in the port development.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What reason could he have to have his daughter deliver this to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was deeply absorbed in thought looking at the blueprints from Baron Philinover. While Milton had received a lot of gifts from the other nobles, this was his favorite. He felt as though the Baron had seen the direction Forrest Territory was developing in and had given Milton guidelines to help move forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I should meet with her.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Request Lady Philinover to come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Milton had gotten tired of meeting with the young ladies, it became a different story if he was meeting them for business.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A while later.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A beauty with slightly curled, bright red hair soon appeared in front of Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Sophia Philinover. It is an honor to see you again, Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia gracefully greeted Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She definitely feels like a Capital’s noble.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While Southern nobles weren’t mannerless, they lacked the sophistication due to subtle differences. Compared to them, the young lady in front of Milton was both clever and sophisticated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a pleasure to see you. But, you came much quicker than I had expected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I didn’t leave and instead waited in front of the manor in case you asked for me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton perked up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘If you consider the aristocratic young lady’s pride, that couldn’t have been an easy thing to do…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking she had been harshly ordered by her father, Milton felt a bit sorry for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wasn’t feeling well, so I took the day off. I apologize for making you wait.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, Count Forrest. It was my fault for coming so suddenly without notice. I’m just happy to have met you today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton saw her gently smiling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Her face and clothing are innocent, so why does she seem so sexy? Is it because of her hair color?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It really was because of her hair color. If you looked just at Sophia’s face, then she looked gentle and innocent, but her</span><span>&nbsp;fire-red hair colo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">r gave her a seductive image. There were a lot of reddish-brown hair colors, but Sophia’s hair was much brighter and closer to a true red color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When she smiled, her innocently seductive look was like an arrow straight to a man’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cough…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Let’s focus. Focus.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After losing himself to her beauty, Milton shook himself awake and focused back on the main point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The gift you gave me was intriguing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia gave him a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for the acknowledgment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It looked like the work of an expert architect? Could you please tell me whose work it is?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that, Sophia blushed and shyly responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Such overwhelming praise, My Lord. An expert architect? I’m embarrassed by such praise when I’ve only ever self-studied.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait. You’re telling me…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was truly surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lady Philinover, are you saying you drew those blueprints?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, although I’m embarrassed to say so, those were done by me, they are my children.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was dumbfounded. Could this young lady be lying to him right now? Could she be that reckless? But why tell a lie that could be uncovered instantly?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Shall I check it?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have a couple of questions I wanted to ask.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the blueprints for the city planning…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton began to ask questions about the parts he had been curious about. If she wasn’t the one who had drawn them, it would be obvious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It became like that because I prioritized transportation. Once the residential areas were built, I thought it would be better to maximize transportation from the beginning rather than repurchasing land and moving residents to expand the road after it had all been built. And over there…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no pause in her answer. She knew the structure and purpose of the blueprint so well that she was able to answer Milton’s question without glancing at it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She really drew it? Aristocratic young lady architect? Unbelievable. It’s not like she’s a 21st-century Korean female living alone and interior decorating…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was dumbfounded. This was like saying that she was an idol but liked to do hard labor as a hobby. At least, that’s how Milton felt. Sophia Philinover certainly was unique. Milton wanted to know what her abilities were like.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Sophia Philinover]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Architect LV. 2</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Strength - 05 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Command - 25</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Intellect - 79 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Politics - 52</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Loyalty - 05</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Special Traits - Architecture, Civil Engineering, Art.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Architecture LV.5: Has an excellent sense in designing buildings effectively.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Civil Engineering LV.6: Shows excellent ability in the construction of civil engineering facilities such as roads, bridges, and levees.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Art LV.4: The aesthetic sense is excellent and the perspective in viewing arts and crafts increases.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘That’s surprising. She’s really an architect?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doubting her abilities even after checking the status window was meaningless. Even more so, her talent as an architect was incredible. That her intelligence stat had reached 79 was proof of that. Because her knowledge in architecture and civil engineering was so great, her intelligence stat was close to 80. And on top of that, all her special traits were related to architecture. These traits would not have come if she didn’t have extensive knowledge about the civil engineering industry, everything from the small buildings to the national infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In this part, the city’s drainage system is arranged by taking advantage of the difference in terrain…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Sophia had been&nbsp;</span><span>elated</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to expound upon her blueprint that she had been endlessly explaining while Milton had been admiring her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cough… Lady Philinover. May I ask a question?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, any time My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes shined as if begging Milton to continue asking her questions about architecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re a young lady from a noble family, so how do you have such deep knowledge about architecture?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia blushed as though she had just realized where she was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forgive me. It’s a bit strange, isn’t it? That a woman is so fascinated by architecture…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing her crestfallen, Milton responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think it’s unique.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shoulders drooping, Sophia replied, “I… I love architecture. From an early age…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You like architecture?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I’ve liked it since I was a child.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s a pretty peculiar liking.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, it’s a bit unusual.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia smiled bitterly and began to talk about her childhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
