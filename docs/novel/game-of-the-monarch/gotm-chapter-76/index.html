 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton and his knights were able to easily dispose of the enemy scouts with the aid of Bianca’s invisibility spell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the midst of this pitch-black forest with a narrow field of vision and the sounds of nature filling the air, the enemy troops could not detect them a single time as they were helplessly wiped out. But more than anything…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘They absolutely weren’t prepared for an invisibility spell. There was nothing they could do.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Magicians were an exceedingly rare sight. Not only that, but it was public knowledge that the Lester Kingdom did not officially retain any magicians. Consequently, the enemy would not have even imagined this scenario.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whatever the case may be, Milton succeeded in creating a massive opening in the enemy’s area of reconnaissance. There was only one job left to do.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s an enemy attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred, who had fallen asleep after exhaustively preparing measures for an enemy attack, was jolted awake by the voice of a sentry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a night ambush by the enemy, Captain Alfred.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A what!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred was shocked wide awake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He really had prepared exhaustively, leaving no stone unturned in readying their countermeasures. Yet the enemy had still managed to attack their site under the cover of night.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This just can’t be.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">How did the enemy know that they were encamped in a bivouac in the midst of this forest?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">How did the enemy avoid their meticulous reconnaissance network and attack their site?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Try as he may, Alfred could not understand the situation that was presently unfolding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain Alfred, please deliver your orders. We must respond to the enemy’s attack.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred regained his bearings at the urging of a messenger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All men are to take up arms and put up a fight at once. Bodyguards, follow me. I will be commanding in person at the scene.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred drew his sword and exited his tent, promptly surveying the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“ARGH!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fight! Do not be flustered, and- UGH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The state of affairs was not particularly good. Though they could not precisely ascertain the enemy’s numbers due to the nature of the attack, the scale of the ambush pointed to a size of at least 1,000 invaders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it… how did a force of this size avoid the recon and make it all the way to the main camp?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred was usually as careful with his words as he was with his actions, but he could say nothing but curses right now. The most pressing matter was stabilizing this situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rally the men. The enemy is but a fraction of our numbers! Do not be taken aback and respond calmly!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred personally commanded his troops in real time, ordering the subordinate officers to organize the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Second Lieutenant Lens, move towards the east with 200 men. Warrant Officers Blade and Petri: it’s already too late for the south. Command your soldiers to protect the archers instead. We can repel the enemy in no time so long as we stay composed!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Realizing this was an emergency, Alfred issued bold and decisive commands. Although his name as a commander had spread for the high survival rate of his troops, this was an urgent situation. He made sweeping and drastic orders, giving up on the areas where he thought there was no hope and concentrating on salvaging what they could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing as they had come this far anyway, the loss of troops was unavoidable. To put it bluntly, this was the path to saving the most troops’ lives in a dilemma such as this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he continued to command and put up a struggle, the enemy began to sense difficulties and started withdrawing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ve dealt enough damage. Retreat! All troops, retreat!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that the enemies withdrew, seemingly assessing that they had wreaked enough havoc.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, I shall pursue the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the Republican officers offered to chase after them, brimming with rage – but Alfred quickly held him back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I cannot allow it. Besides, there is nothing to gain from pursuing them in this situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“More importantly, assessing our damages takes first priority. Gauge our losses and make a report at once.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred was intensely anxious as he gave his directions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the enemy commander withdrew, he had said that they had done enough; as if they had sufficiently completed the objectives for which they had raided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Surely not… please no…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;In his head, he kept replaying the scenario which he feared most.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A moment later, a messenger hastily approached him and reported the damage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain Alfred, we have counted a total of 3,300 fatalities from the night ambush. Our casualty numbers will only increase if we include the wounded.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that all?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What about the supply goods? Are the supplies safe?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Oh? Oh… yes, they’re safe. We had stored them in two different places, and both&nbsp;</span><span>have</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;emerged unscathed by the enemy’s attack.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pheeew…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred instinctively breathed out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s good to hear, at the least.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were two outcomes that needed to be avoided most by defenders in a night raid: one was the commander being killed, and the other was the destruction or plundering of supplies. If nothing else, these two results absolutely had to be avoided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing as he still had his neck intact, all that needed to be paid heed were the supplies; and much to his relief, it seemed the worst of futures had been avoided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It appears the bastards did not have the liberty of seeking and destroying our supplies, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right. I see. Just in case, bolster the guards on patrol. We will be retreating to the rear at first light. The western front is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred had a grave look on his face as he continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…our defeat. But we will pay it back without fail.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord, the enemy has withdrawn.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right on schedule.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton nodded at Jerome’s report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact that they caused less damage to the enemy than expected weighed on his mind, but the enemy had prioritized security far too well in the layout of their camp for their attack to do more. It was likely that his troops would begin having larger losses if they overexerted and gave chase here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike approached Milton’s side and queried him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are we just going to let them go without making use of this good opportunity to pursue them?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no helping it. We have ourselves quite the meticulous foe. He had come out for battle with a retreat route already secured.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Still, if it is your command… I’ll go make something happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Trike said he would make something happen, he meant sniping the enemy commander. If anyone was capable of making it work, it would be Trike – even if he operated alone in the dead of night.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was tempted and considered it for a moment, but he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The situation’s already rolling along according to plan. The enemy commander’s head isn’t so much of a priority as to warrant being that ambitious.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Reaching this conclusion at heart, Milton shook his head again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is currently no need for that. Leave them to flee.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm… might you have something in mind, my lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton formed a hint of a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You will see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred rounded his army and retreated to the rear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their losses were minimized thanks to the withdrawal route being prepared in advance and responding effectively to the night raid when it happened. An ordinary commander would have been screwed here, but Alfred had managed to safely withdraw with over 70% of his force intact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Albeit, there was something he still couldn’t figure out…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘How on earth did he manage to incapacitate the scout network?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After their retreat, Alfred scoured for the reason he was defeated to no avail.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reconnaissance network had collapsed, seeing as not a single scout had returned alive. That much he knew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But how?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred never let pride get the better of him, but he nonetheless had confidence in the quality of his scouts. Even out of these men who were all used to the mountains, only the gritty and nimble were selected in maintaining the size and quality of the recon unit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the first place, the Hildess Republic’s mountain soldiers were already elite amongst the elite. Their eyes and ears were sharp, and they could move quickly over rough terrain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Such scouts were all killed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He simply could not understand. A skillful assassin may be able to slay one or two if they were caught by surprise, but tearing apart the entirety of this scrupulous network would indeed be a tall order.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘How in damnation did he manage this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Continuously drawing blanks was starting to drive Alfred mad, as he needed to know the cause of his defeat to prepare accordingly. It was a source of considerable frustration for someone as cautious in war as Alfred that he could not discern what tactics the enemy used.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What shall we do, Captain Alfred?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His aide-de-camp asked him of their plans forward, and in response Alfred chose the safest option available to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We shall hole up in a stronghold and weather it out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Republican army entered Fort Ranken, the place with the sturdiest walls in their vicinity, with the intention of making their stand against the enemy’s offensive here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Secretary Siegfried’s orders can be completed so long as we hold out.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred knew that he was not a particularly daring type, but he entered the stronghold with the resolve to complete his assigned mission no matter what.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy has fortified in a position.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton nodded at the messenger’s report as if he had anticipated this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So it comes to this as expected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He called a meeting at once to react accordingly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s quite the headache that they are bunkering down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is Fort Ranken not one of the sturdiest military fortresses of the North?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It looks like laying siege to them will take quite some time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Milton listened to the discussion of the Southern nobles before speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is no need to prepare for a siege.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Might you have an idea?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles’ eyes were glittering with expectation, having witnessed the solid results he had brought in war until now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton did not betray those expectations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy will leave the castle of their own accord. We will wipe them out there and then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Southern nobles smiled with awe at Milton’s assurances.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If that is what the Count says, we will trust and obey without question.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though the nobles participating with the Southern army were not exactly outstanding talents, they had one thing going for them: they were aware of their lack of field experience and did not step out of line to object needlessly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Due to that, they smoothly followed Milton’s lead though he made a solo assessment and even skipped explaining his reasoning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Southern army formed a robust formation facing Fort Ranken as Milton had commanded. They did not attempt a siege and merely maintained this faceoff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton called on Bianca.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How many days will it take, roughly?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ten if it’s long. If it’s not, I’m feelin’ round five or so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton speechlessly gazed upon the castle walls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The enemy was shaping up to be a remarkable commander who was considerably cautious. However, as long as he was unaware that they had the exceptional power of magic on their side, the enemies were still dancing on the palm of Milton’s hand for now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred did not leave the castle ramparts, eating and sleeping atop them as he monitored the situation himself. If he caught some shuteye, he would ask his aide-de-camp for an update as soon as he woke up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the status of the enemy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nothing has changed. They are stationed in their spots and have not attacked.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;“Was there no hint of them detouring through a different area?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There was not. It may very well be that the enemy is simply keeping watch because they cannot devise an optimal solution.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred widened his eyes at his aide’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you believe the enemy to be that incompetent?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not at all, sir. I’m merely projecting-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I suppose that would make me even more incompetent trash, being defeated by such an enemy and losing 11 percent of my troops.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is not so. I would never say something along those lines.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Watching his flustered assistant, Alfred abruptly let out a heavy sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… Haaah.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What is this shameful conduct?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had only intended to caution his aide to prevent carelessness from settling in his heart. But he suddenly found himself interrogating his assistant – almost as if he was taking out his frustration at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred realized that he was backed into a tight spot psychologically more than he had thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I must apologize. My words were too much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it’s nothing. You are correct, Captain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmmm… I do say this every time, but there is never room for carelessness. Even more so for this particularly strong enemy. They would never do something without further intent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I’ll be sure to remember that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the time, Alfred did not know: whatever came next would be futile to stop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because that event had already unfolded at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
