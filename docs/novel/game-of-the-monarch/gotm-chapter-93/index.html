 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nothing in life is easy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A visionary plan. Talented people. Active support.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even when all the conditions were met, there were times when good results didn't happen even when the conditions were good. Like right now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Attacked by pirates?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry, My Lord. There’s nothing else I can say.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was shocked by the report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max had enthusiastically set out to accomplish the assignment given to him by Milton. Max had spent a lot of money arranging ships and crew members and by collecting information, he had even secured the necessary weapons that might be needed. Once all of that had been completed, Max had personally gone on the voyage himself. This amount of effort had been the direct result of his loyalty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so, on the first voyage attempted, Max had gone directly to the Gloucester Kingdom and made contact with seven merchant companies. With this, even if it wasn’t an exclusive trade with Waterport Kingdom that Milton had originally wanted, it could still be considered a successful maiden voyage. But even after that, Max had made two more trips to Gloucester Kingdom and expanded the business and made more deals with merchants. He was even planning to create a merchant company run by the Forrest family and having a branch be located in Gloucester Kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just when it seemed as though everything was going smoothly, something happened on the third voyage. On their way back from trading with Gloucester Kingdom, Max’s ship had been attacked by pirates. Not only had they plundered all the goods and the money, but Max had also been taken hostage. And…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those bastards said that if we want to get our Chief Administrator back, we have to pay them 20,000 gold as ransom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Squeeze.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton’s grip crushed the corner of the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you’re saying that’s what those scumbags were spouting?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Marquis.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those XX sons of b*ches…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton’s head seemed to be steaming with anger as he burst out of his seat and shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get me Jerome. I’ll teach those f*cking pirates a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was determined to personally go out to sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, that Marquis said he’ll pay the ransom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really? Puhahaha… good. Very good. Should we just change our route to here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red Beard, the captain of the Red Pirates laughed out loud.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red Beard, he was originally a pirate who was active in the Southern part of the continent. But, once he heard that there was a lot of trading going on in the Western coast of the continent, Red Beard had quickly made his way over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had his men hide and watch the harbor to see when their target would come. Everything moved quickly once he had learned that the target of the rumor had arrived at port. With familiarity, they had attacked the target in the middle of their route and taken both the ship and the goods on it. He had wanted to kill all the people on the ship in order to get rid of witnesses. However, one of the targets spoke up…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait, instead of killing me, it’d be better to demand ransom from Marquis Forrest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, the Captain thought it was bullshit, but the more he listened, the more it seemed plausible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Max, the Chief Administrator for Marquis Forrest. If you kill me, you won’t get a single silver coin, but if you keep me alive, My Lord will pay the ransom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, Red Beard laughed it off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How hilarious. A noble paying ransom for a commoner? That little…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“20,000 gold.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max flatly interrupted Red Beard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">20,000 gold was a lot of money that even the pirates who were mocking him turned silent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why not at least try? It’s not like you would lose anything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of a sudden, Max had taken control of the conversation and was tempting the pirates.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm… fine. You said 20,000 gold? It won’t hurt to try.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max clenched his fist the moment Red Beard said this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s hooked.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had been the worst possible scenario the moment the pirates had attacked, but he couldn’t die like this. Max still wanted to use and expand his talents in this world. That was why he had told the pirates about the ransom and persuaded them to keep him alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had used 20,000 as bait but, would Milton actually pay that ransom for him?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this wasn’t the main thing. The important thing was that they were nothing more than pirates, and they had dared to hold hostage one of Milton’s men. This was Max’s trick.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Once My Lord comes, those pirates won’t even be a problem.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton Forrest had written a new legend of invincibility during the war against the Republicans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Max didn’t know much about war, he was certain that the pirates would be annihilated the moment Milton arrived. So, it didn’t matter whether the ransom was 20,000 or 200,000 gold as long as he was able to create a hostage situation. This was the plan Max thought up on the spot. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, no!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, one man appeared and tried to snuff out Max’s plan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Squid, what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man nicknamed Squid was skinny and had small eyes. He was so skinny that he was almost just skin and bones that just by looking at him, it was difficult to believe that he was a pirate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He replied while staring at Max.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That punk is trying to play a trick on us, Captain. He’s trying anything to live.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Of course he is. So what? It doesn’t matter to us as long as we get our ransom, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But we’re not even sure if they’ll pay the ransom. Have you ever seen a nobleman pay 20,000 gold just for a commoner? It’s definitely a trick, Captain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You think?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Squid’s word, Red Beard seemed to be rethinking the hostage situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing him like that, Max urgently shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’ll definitely pay it! My Lord really thinks highly of me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But still, isn’t 20,000 gold a bit too much? It’s not like we’ve captured a beautiful woman, you’re just a punk…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Red Beard beginning to get suspicious, Max unwittingly yelled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My… My Lord loves me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His… his preferences lean in that direction…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In life, there are moments when you just spout nonsense. That day seemed to be today for Max.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Damn it, am I finished?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking that there was no way they would believe the nonsense he just said, Max was disheartened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm… I see. I heard there were noblemen who were like that before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it seemed like Red Beard had thought it could be true.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine. We’ll keep you alive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain! I’m telling you, that bastard’s just playing a trick on us! Urk!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Smack</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Squid continued to comment, Red Beard stopped the unnecessary comments with a single punch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You punk. Didn’t I say we’re keeping him alive for now? For now. But if it’s all a trick, then I’ll kill him later, alright?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh… but we can’t be sure…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk, you got balls… I’ll deal with this, so you just shut your mouth and navigate!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red Beard approached Max.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you’re lying, know that you won’t die peacefully. Got it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y… yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Towards the end, Squid had almost ruined his plan, but now, it was going as Max had wished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After that, Red Beard tried to kill the other sailors, but Max managed to save their lives as he convinced Red Beard that he'd only get the ransom if the sailors were alive. Red Beard was happy because today, he had finally heard back that Milton was willing to pay the ransom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where should I exchange the hostages? I’m guessing a place like an uninhabited island would be best?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Squid quickly tried to stop him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, captain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Why are you telling me no again?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red Beard didn’t like Squid constantly saying no to everything he said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Squid spoke to him desperately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, you don’t know what those nobles might do, how can you directly exchange hostages like this? What’ll you do if they bring a Knight and try to kill us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Almost as though he was convinced by Squid, Red Beard nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that you mentioned it, I was suspicious about that as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘At least try not to sound like you’re lying.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red Beard made Squid’s blood pressure rose, but that wasn’t the important thing. Truthfully, Squid was nervous about this whole hostage situation thing, but since it was happening anyway, it was important to be as thorough as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’d be best to do it in the sea, Captain. Each side will meet in the middle on rowboats and make the exchange between hostage and money. So that way, even if those bastards tried to trick us, we’ll be able to get away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright. That sounds like a good idea. Let’s do that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Squid let out a sigh of relief at Red Beard’s words. But a corner of his brain still thought something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’m still not sure about this.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Squid still felt nervous about this deal, but it wasn’t likely that Red Beard would listen to him. Sure, Squid also loved money enough to wake up from deep slumber for it, but it wasn’t more important than his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I can’t do this. It’s a bit early, but let’s carry out the plan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Squid muttered with a determined expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The middle of the night with the moon covered by the clouds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red Beard and his pirates moored their ship on the uninhabited island they used as their base and slept. Even if they were pirates who lived and died in the sea, they still had to have a base on land. The pirates, who were authorized by a country, sometimes used a port as their base, but real(?) pirates like the Red Pirates quietly had their base on an uninhabited island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In order to start their ‘business’ in the region, Red Beard had searched for and taken over a few uninhabited islands as their base. Since it wasn’t possible to continue to carry the wealth plundered from other ships on their own ship, it was normal to hide the wealth on an uninhabited island and sell them all at once later. And when the pirates sink into the sea, that wealth becomes the so-called ‘pirates’ hidden treasures.’ Sometimes adventurers who hear such rumors would search through uninhabited islands looking for it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anyway, after stepping on land after a long time, the Red Pirates relaxed. First, they imprisoned Max, their prisoner of war, and then brought out a keg to the beach and started roasting meat over a campfire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s drink and eat as much as we want today!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Drink! Drunk! Dead!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wahhh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Handling a ship required a high degree of teamwork and mental strength. It may be surprising, but on the sea, pirates didn’t dare to drink enough alcohol to lose their focus on the sea. They never knew when a storm would hit, nor when a reef might appear. So they were always focused. But, things were different once they were on land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh oh oh... we are seamen~♪ brave seamen~♪"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The brave seamen that girls love the most~♪”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The merrily singing pirates were so drunk they were full of weak spots. No one was standing guard and all of them were drunk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no way there could be a threat in this uninhabited island in the middle of the vast sea. Okay. Normally, there shouldn’t be.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I found them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bianca had been searching across the ocean using a seagull.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where are they?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re on an uninhabited island a bit far away from here, drinking and their singing sounds like pigs squealing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, you’re saying they’re drunk?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton gave a broad smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was one of the best opportunities. Milton had been worried about how he would find the bastards and rescue Max, the hostage, but if the pirates were all drunk together, then there was no need to worry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jerome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ready the soldiers. We are ambushing them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Miss Bianca, you said they were on the uninhibited island’s beach?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeup.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can you guide our ship to the other side?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yea, I can do that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bianca released the seagull from her Familiar magic and found a dolphin to cast her spell on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the dolphin’s back glittered the Luminescent magic and it became the perfect guide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Done, follow it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, Miss Bianca. Follow that light.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was risky to travel during the night because the ship might hit a reef, but that wasn’t an issue when Bianca was using the dolphin to guide them along a safe path. And so, Milton’s ship was able to safely travel to the other side of the uninhabited island where the pirates were drinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
