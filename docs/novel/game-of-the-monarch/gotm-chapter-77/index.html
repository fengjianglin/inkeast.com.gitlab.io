 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One day passed, then two, then five – and the Southern army still had no signs of movement. They quietly sustained this standoff without so much as a single arrow shot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred could not understand their intent no matter how much he mulled over it, not that there was a particular measure they could react with regardless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was then that Alfred received a peculiar report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Some of the men have fallen ill, you say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that is so. It’s not a lot yet, but quite a few troops are showing symptoms of a high fever, body aches and vomiting, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How many men have contracted this sickness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are currently around 30 men, sir. They have been isolated under quarantine protocol to be safe.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred nodded at his aide’s report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be sure that the quarantine measures are abided by and keep an eye on the men’s condition.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The situation had not yet reached its tipping point. With barely 30 men falling ill, Alfred assessed that this matter would be allayed soon enough if they only abided by the quarantine measures.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Alfred’s face turned pale at the report he received the next day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, the number of men who have fallen ill has grown. Several hundred patients are raising complaints with the same symptoms.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“How could…&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the quarantine protocol observed for certain?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no mistake that all measures were abided by. However, men reporting the same symptoms are appearing in locations that have no connection to the first infected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred bit his lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was more than certain by this point that an infectious disease was circulating the army, and it had to be now of all times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Is there possibly anything worse that could happen?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though Alfred’s composure was one of his strengths, even he could not stay calm in the present situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">How could a plague spread while they were in a standoff with an enemy?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this rate, they would not be able to fight them properly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ensure the sick are thoroughly isolated. Announce that all water is to be boiled before consumption, and hurry to find the common factor underlying all the patients of this outbreak!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred hastily issued his commands, praying that this disease would not spread any further.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Three days later.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite Alfred’s earnest hopes, the disease ruthlessly continued to ravage the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were yet to be any deaths, but considerable numbers of troops were collapsing with high fevers and vomiting. Any efforts to isolate were futile, and all they could do was focus on creating the most sanitary conditions possible in a wartime situation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They could not rid themselves of this disease.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If there was any progress to be had, it was that their epidemiological investigation uncovered the root cause.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the food.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers that were falling ill had specifically eaten the rations that they had protected throughout the enemy’s night raid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Something snapped inside Alfred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“These dogs dare to mess with food?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred muttered under his breath as he clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the stricken fields of war where it was kill or be killed, it was nonsensical for one to refrain from certain tactics. Alfred ground his teeth not because he did not know this, but because he had been backed into this corner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was nothing that changed from knowing the cause of this outbreak after it already happened. All the affected rations had already been consumed by the soldiers, who were now collapsing by the dozen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If this disease was not natural and instead deliberated by the enemy, it meant that they would also be aware of this situation that was unfolding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred now understood his enemy’s objective: they were biding their time for his men to wear out and lose their strength. Alfred needed to make a decision at this stage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His first choice was to take the army outside the fort’s walls in their present condition and win in an orthodox battle. However, their prospects of winning were almost non-existent. When one saw the enemy’s formation was perfectly arranged for combat – without so much as a single siege weapon in sight – it was clear that they were waiting for the defenders to tire out and leave the stronghold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Over half of his men were incapacitated already. If they chose to strive for a head-on battle at this point in time, their chances of emerging victorious were likely less than 5 percent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The issue was that they would be defeated without so much as an opportunity to fight if they were to drag this along and the troops’ condition did not stabilize regardless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The second option was to continue staying entrenched and last it out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Over half the troops were not fit for service, but there was yet for any deaths to arise. Alfred did not know what kind of poison the enemy used, but in the first place it would be difficult to poison such a large quantity of foodstuff and reach a lethal dose. Seeing as there were no deaths thus far, there existed a possibility that the troops would recover in due time. There were enough healthy troops to operate a functional defense despite the great reduction in their strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The caveat was that this was only made a valid option by the presupposed speculation that the troops’ condition would indeed recover with time. If by chance, it worsened instead…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then they would be bitterly holed up in this fort until they withered away and died.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In this dilemma with two completely distinct options, Alfred carefully made his choice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘We’ll concentrate on defending.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their prospects of victory in a head-on battle were too remote. Moreover, the enemy’s formation implied that they were expecting the Republicans to leave their fortified position and come out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though Alfred did not know which was the right path to take, he was not about to move in the direction that the enemy wanted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘We’ll endure with whatever means possible.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred steadfastly set his mind on defense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, that resolve would not last more than a day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A messenger came running to Alfred, who had momentarily come down from the ramparts to inspect their internal state of things.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, the enemy… the enemy…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clearly something big had happened, seeing as the messenger was breathless from making haste to inform Alfred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Has their attack begun?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Two thoughts flashed by Alfred’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">So they finally&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">come</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Come as you may.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had already steeled himself to some extent as this outcome was to be expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, what came next from the messenger was completely beyond Alfred’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy is retreating.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred thought he was hallucinating now – either that, or the messenger had gone nuts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hold it, the enemy is falling back? Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The messenger brightly grinned as Alfred tried to process this information.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, it is true.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The enemy withdrew? The enemy…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred made his way to the ramparts to confirm for himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What awaited him was the empty wilderness, as far as the eye could see. The attackers that had been encamping outside as late as yesterday had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For what reason would they retreat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred murmured to himself, and his aide-de-camp reassured him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not know, but for now it is a relief that the enemy has withdrawn, is it not?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is true. That’s true, yet…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uneasiness simmered in a corner of Alfred’s heart. No enemy would ever take actions without meaning, and any that appeared to do so on the surface was bound to have an ulterior motive. This was unmistakably one of those times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What would be the reason? What benefit would they gain from withdrawing their- hold on, surely not.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One possibility flashed into Alfred’s head. He urgently ordered his assistant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bring me the map!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sorry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I said bring me the map! And send scouts to monitor the enemy’s movement!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh… yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hurry!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred clenched his teeth as the assistant dashed out. If his hypothesis turned out to be correct…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>This was the true</span><span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">worst possible situation they could be in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There are moments in life when time feels as if it is dilating. If one reaches the very brink of their impatience and nervousness, a passing second becomes a day and a minute becomes a year.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was one of those moments for Alfred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred’s assistant could not bring himself to strike a conversation in this overbearing atmosphere while his Captain stared at the map as he waited for the scouts’ report to come in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At last, the scouts returned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In which direction did the enemy withdraw?” Alfred cut straight to the chase.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The recon troops drew a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy is moving towards the east.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred shot up straight up from his seat and issued a command to his assistant immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gather all troops that can move at once! We are pursuing the enemy!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His aide was astonished at Alfred’s drastic order, starkly contrasting with his usual careful and calculating stratagems.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, let us please think this through. As long as we hold this fortress…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Make haste! We no longer have the freedom of choice, I tell you!!” Alfred thundered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They promptly rallied all the men that could still fight and mobilized to give chase to Milton’s army of the South.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Republican’s movements were tracked through the magic of Bianca’s familiars, who informed Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, they left the fort.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So they finally come out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred thought he was forced into a dilemma between keeping themselves entrenched or attacking their enemy and engaging in a proper battle. But he was sorely mistaken.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the beginning, Milton had no intention of giving his opponent a choice at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, Milton waited for the poison to spread and take its effect amongst the enemy. In retrospect, this was Alfred’s prime opportunity to take action. While the poison that Bianca had concocted was so potent that it could affect a large number of troops in comparatively small quantities, it had an incubation period. If Alfred forced a head-on battle before the effects of the poison came into full stride, Milton would have had no choice but to accede to it. But Alfred would never have made such a decision as he had not yet known of the poison, which was also why Milton’s army could encamp at the fortress’ doorstep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Although Alfred chose to defend, Milton withdrew nonetheless when the&nbsp;</span><span>poison’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;effect was slated to reach its peak. Only, he moved to the east instead of retreating to the rear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Towards the east lay the battle unfolding between Siegfried and the Strabus Kingdom’s Duke Derrick&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. But what would happen if Milton moved his forces in their direction and struck Siegfried from the rear?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred’s assignment was to keep this enemy occupied as long as possible. Regardless of whether they won or lost, his number one priority was to keep the enemy busy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, Alfred did not have any choice but to respond in kind if Milton moved towards the east. They had to pursue them and engage in combat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jerome!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jerome responded faithfully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Turn all troops around. Let us prepare a welcome for our guests.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">By the time Alfred and his men had caught up to Milton, he had already prepared all there was to prepare. However, Alfred did not have the option of stopping here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All troops, charge! We shall become a founding stone of a new utopia!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Uoooooh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred’s roar was returned by his soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To become one of the founding stones of a new utopia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was said whenever the Republican soldiers steeled themselves to fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a demand that the men serve up their lives with the faith that even if they were to die right now, Republicanism would one day take over Royalism &nbsp;to bring a new age. As the soldiers of the Republic were exhaustively educated on this ideology and had it drilled into them, their spirits surged forth the moment they heard such a phrase.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred was trying to raise the vigor of his troops and bring a favorable outcome with whatever means possible. Ideally they would repel the enemy, but if that was impossible, the least they could do was kill the enemy commander so they would fall back. Particularly, it was Alfred’s first of an enemy commander making such a fool out of him – and thus Alfred also had personal sentiments to be rid of him when he had the chance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the enemy before them was much too strong for Alfred to expect results merely by raising morale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fire!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike’s archer unit promptly dotted the sky with their arrows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Shuk!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Shukshukshuk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“URK!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“AAAAAAAH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Screams rang out as the arrows hit the charging frontline. Alfred clenched his teeth and shouted once again to prevent his troops from faltering.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do not waver! The only method of avoiding the arrows is to close the distance! Forward!! FORWARD!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cautious commander who spared the most troops.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This reputation was overshadowed by the Alfred of now, who coerced his soldiers into sacrificing themselves. There was no other way they could approach this – this was a battle that demanded these measures.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uooooh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Die, you bastards!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hurrah for Republicanism!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Republican troops continued to advance forward even as the arrows continued to pincushion them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One step, then another… Forward they moved, making headway one step at a time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men faced death head-on, entrusting the troops in the line behind them to take the next step if they were to fall.</span></p>
