 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good work everyone, you’ve all worked hard. Let’s go inside before you tell me the details.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton went inside and changed to something more comfortable before listening to the reports from his retainers. Max and all the other retainers stood proudly in front of Milton.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, I’ll start reporting, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please start.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“First of all, the port and mine that you wanted to develop has been finished while you were gone, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton already knew all this because he had checked with his abilities, but he pretended not to know as he listened to the report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Were there any problems?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord. While we had some difficulties trying to find workers for the mine, the problem resolved itself as the territory’s population continued to grow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right, then what about the port?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because the port has just been established, we haven’t obtained any results. But as the population increased, we’ve had the upper society wanting to join, so as soon as the port gets busy, it should be a huge benefit to the estate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good, well done.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord. Lady Sophia has contributed a lot to the port’s development.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Max praised Lady Sophia, Milton turned towards her with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve accomplished a lot.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, My Lord. It’s all because you trusted me and were willing to let me work.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia gracefully lifted the hem of her skirt in a curtsey as she responded to him. Outwardly, she seemed like a lovely young noble lady, but Milton noticed that Sophia also had a significant increase in her abilities. Sophia smoothly took over reporting to Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will report on the construction of the port and the renovation of the city, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She passed him the prepared documents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The city was formed around the central plaza with roads spreading outward from it and a clear division between residential and commercial districts. The water and sewage facilities were also completed alongside the network of roads.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton quietly marveled at her work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I really hit the jackpot. I wonder where such a pretty and smart jackpot like her came from.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For some reason, Sophia was really pleasing to the eye right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“However, it’s important that we secure a water supply source in advance to prepare for an increase in population, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Secure a water supply source? Do you have a specific proposal for it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think it’s best to build a dam to secure our water supply, My Lord. I have both the site and a construction plan ready, but because this wasn’t something that I could decide on my own, I was waiting until you returned home, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia handed him the paperwork that would allow her to build the dam.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get started on it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With no further discussion, Milton boldly signed the permit. Sophia gave a delighted grin as though she was a child who had just received a present. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She’s really that happy about building a dam?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia really was an unusual lady, most ladies would have preferred dresses or jewels.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although there were several other reports, they were mostly about the same stuff — as the population increased, the size of the territory naturally increased, and consequently, the territory became more developed. After Milton heard all the reports, he spoke to his retainers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once again, thank you for all your hard work while I was away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Milton’s praise, everyone looked proud of themselves. When Milton looked at his retainers, he realized that only a couple of them had a Loyalty stat that was below 80 — he had mostly won them over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you may have heard, the Republican burnt down our Capital.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re bastards worse than an animal…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How could they destroy it just because they couldn’t take over?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re absolutely unforgivable.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of them were angry, but Sophia was the angriest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Capital itself was a testament to the great culture and history of… but to burn it all…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia wailed her indignation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Oh dear… should I comfort her?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton wanted to try to coax her, but then realized that other people were also there. Instead, he spoke with poise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s all calm down now. Anyway, it will take a long time to rebuild the Capital, but in order for a country to function, it must have a center. And so, Princess Leila has decided to make our Forrest Estate the temporary Capital.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All his retainers were startled by his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Truly, My Lord? Our Estate will be the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It will only be temporary.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“E— even so, our Estate as the Capital… My Lord, then will our territory become the center of the country for the time being?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I assume so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>They got very excited. Originally, the South was considered a backwood countryside to the rest of the Lester Kingdom. You could tell how the rest of the country thought of them just by looking at how Rick and Tommy had been the butt of the Capital nobles’ joke at a clothing store. But now, Forrest Estate&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the center of the country. Even if it was temporary, it wasn’t decided how long that might be. If it was a short period of time, it would be about 3 to 5 years. It may even be a longer period of time and perhaps even stay as the Capital. It goes without saying what a great opportunity this was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Yeup. Wherever you go, it’s always great if national policy is tied to real estate.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton thought to himself as he looked at his excited retainers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I agree, this is great, but you have to keep in mind that the amount of work that needs to be done has increased.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As his retainers’ expressions grew serious, Milton continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The first thing we need to do is find accommodations for the refugees that will be arriving.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the population grows, it is important to be able to support them so they can survive. Food, clothing, and shelter were more important than anything else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, how many refugees will arrive from the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s estimated that there will be a little more than 300,000 refugees.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“300,000…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>For a moment, Max looked tired. Currently, Forrest territory&nbsp;</span><span>had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;about 130,000 people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was no wonder he would be tired when it would be burdensome to instantly add more than three times the current population.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be honest, this was a lot less than the original number. When the Republicans had invaded the Capital, there were 1million citizens who had followed Princess Leila and evacuated. That number included both the elderly and the children. But 100,000 people could not handle the harsh life as a refugee and had died. And once the war was over, about half of the refugees had stayed behind to rebuild the Capital. And half of those remaining refugees, mainly the strong men, had applied to become soldiers and serve in the North. With this war, many of them had realized how terrible it was for a nation to have no power during a war and had volunteered to become soldiers. And after it had been cut down many times, the final number of people that Forrest Estate had to accommodate was 300,000. But this was still a large number.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will there be a separate subsidy from the government, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess Leila said that for the time being, she would use her personal accounts to support this. She has also promised tax exemption for the next three years.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As though thankful, Max sighed in relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The refugees will be arriving in the next ten days. For a while, they’ll pitch tents and live like refugees but they can’t live like that forever. Sophia.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The most important thing is the living environment. It’s alright if it’s temporary, but make an environment that is livable for the people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia thought for a bit before responding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’ll be impossible to build something for everyone one at a time. Even if it’s a bit inconvenient, I think it’ll be best if we built a communal housing facility that could accommodate more than 100 people at once.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll leave that up to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because Milton knew very well what Sophia could do as an architect, he gave full authority to do as she wished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And Max.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m removing you from the Administrator position.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a second, Max looked as though his entire world had collapsed, but his face brightened as Milton continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since the territory has gotten bigger, we need to create separate administrative offices. I’m giving you the position of Chief Administrator and entrusting you with full authority over the administration personnel.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This basically meant that Milton was entrusting the entire territory’s internal affairs to Max. In the past, Milton couldn’t reappoint him in such an important position because even though Max was highly skilled, his Loyalty was low. But now that his Loyalty had reached 95, Milton had zero hesitations with giving Max the reins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll never let you down, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm, I trust you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With those words, Max’s Loyalty instantly shot up to 98.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Why’s it going up so quickly… ah! Wasn’t that one of my traits?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Monarch’s Dignity LV.2: <span id="docs-internal-guid-0e622724-7fff-8a95-2db8-69d33b7417a4" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Your presence alone instills faith in allies and strikes fear into enemies. Vassals’ loyalty can be greatly increased through apt reward and punishment.</span></span>.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thanks to this special trait, the subordinates’ loyalties could increase a lot according to the rewards and punishments. But that didn’t mean you could randomly reward people. It was an ability that was only effective if appropriate rewards were given to the right person at the right time. It seemed to have been the perfect moment for Max.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">****</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>There’s a saying, ‘</span><span>When fortune knocks upon the door, open it widely<span id="footnote-ref-1fc7"><a href="#footnote-1fc7">[1]</a></span></span><span>’ and&nbsp;</span><span>‘strike when the iron is hot.’’<span id="footnote-ref-aed6"><a href="#footnote-aed6">[2]</a></span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the refugees flocked to Forrest estate, the administrators of the territory were so busy they didn’t have a moment to rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those looking to register their citizenship, please do it here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To speed up the process, please register together if you came together with your family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s not enough food and blankets over here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The B-2 residence is full.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max hired people in hoards to fill the administrative positions and to help accommodate the refugees. They registered each incoming refugees’ citizenship and divided up the residential districts for even distribution amongst the refugees.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As ordered by Milton, Sophia had started the construction of the communal housing facilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even in the process of accepting the excessive influx of 300,000 people at once, Forrest territory was still able to continue developing. How was this possible? Was it because Max was competent and the administrators under him were all working hard? Undoubtedly so. But, even though the administrator was competent, there was another reason for the territory to be running this smoothly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That reason was money. It costs money just to stay alive. And the amount of money 300,000 people needed was ridiculous. But the reason Forrest Territory was able to comfortably accept that many people was because Princess Leila was a tremendous sponsor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even Milton had been astonished by Princess Leila’s fundings. The amount of money she had when she was previously the head of Charlotte Merchant Company was just the tip of the iceberg. Money was just pouring out of her, like water out of a well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At the rate it’s going, it’ll only last about a year.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eventually all wells will draw out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was surprised by this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’ll only last a year?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s talk straight. The money is lasting a year because it’s me. Do you know how much of my money you’re spending right now, Marquis?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton gave a wry laugh. In fact, he had also been wondering if it was alright for him to spend this much. But he also had something to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not like I’m just wasting the money, Your Highness. We’re prioritizing and only spending it where we must and trying to be as economical as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I realize that. I’m not saying to blame anyone, I’m just pointing out the reality of our situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila sighed before she continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whatever we do, I can only last a year with our current expenditures. So all I’m saying is that we need to stabilize the situation before then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s a difficult issue.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It always is when you’re trying to stabilize a country.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was more difficult than trying to defeat an enemy in war. But, one thing immediately came to Milton’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s start with something easy. Should you ascend the throne first, Your Highness? I thought quite a few people were whining about that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila grinned at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even you’re whining at me, Marquis?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Recently, a lot of people&nbsp;</span><span>had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;been recommending Princess Leila to ascend the throne. Currently, Princess Leila’s authority was no different from that of the king. Leaving the throne empty while trying to stabilize a country wasn’t a good idea. However, there was a reason Princess Leila hadn’t given in to the people’s wishes and still hesitated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I knew whether my father was alive or dead, then I'd make my decision.”</span></p>

  <p>1. <span>노는 물이 들어왔을 때 저어야 한다 is an idiom. Literal translation of it would be that you should row when water is coming inland (so that you can go out and fish) but I’ve used a similar idiom in replacement <a href="#footnote-ref-1fc7"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></span></p>

 <div id="footnote-aed6">
  <p>2. 쇠뿔은 단 김에 뽑아야 한다 is another idiom. 쇠뿔 is a ox horn that apparently can be pulled out/shaped when you heat it up. So if the horn is heated up, you should take the opportunity and either shape or pull it since it’s already been heated up for you <a href="#footnote-ref-aed6"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
