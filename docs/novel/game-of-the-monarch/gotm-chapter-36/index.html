 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His Strength alone was 79. This was pleasantly beyond what Milton had expected from an archer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton’s own Strength as an Expert was 72. This meant that based purely on the Strength stat, Trike was higher than an Expert swordsman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘How is this possible?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The power exuding from this man seemed nowhere near that level. If they were to duel with swords, Milton would unmistakably win.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Milton realized why his Strength was so high upon observing his Special Traits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Farsighted, Snipe, Rapid Fire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All three of the Special Traits he possessed were related to archery.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, instead of pruning his aura to reach the Expert stage in swordsmanship, he had invested his efforts into polishing his archery to reach new heights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This ‘Monarch’s Authority’ system assessed that his archery skills were equivalent to 79 Strength. Trike had solely amassed his archery skills to the point where it was deemed to surpass Expert-grade Strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was clear that he possessed both the extraordinary talent and the dedication in chiseling himself necessary to reach this level.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘All that considered, it makes sense now. Besides, I’ve already seen a similar occasion once before.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was thinking of his Administrator Max.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max’s Intelligence was 77.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">High as it was, he could not be brought to the battlefield as an advisor because the majority of his knowledge and experience was related to internal state affairs. Therefore despite his high Intelligence, he could not be brought to a war without any direction and be told to think up a strategy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘No matter how great this ‘Authority’ power is, that doesn’t make the world a video game. This world clearly consists of living, breathing humans, and each has their own individuality…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton now had a wider understanding of his powers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Watching Milton, Trike bluntly asked him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whatcha doin’?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was not surprised that Milton would appear at his cell like this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Looks like they lost as expected. Though they lost quicker than I thought they would.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Having anticipated the outcome of this war already, Trike had also projected that Milton would come to him after emerging the victor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What he did not expect was what would follow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had exclaimed something after seeing him, after which he seemed to be quietly pondering something before nodding his head and making an expression saying, ‘I see.’ – all while Trike stayed put.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So what did Trike think?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I’m f**ked. He’s not a complete nutjob, is he?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a perfectly reasonable concern.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike became exceedingly worried as he realized this lunatic would be deciding his fate. Unable to keep silent, he eventually opened his mouth first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whatcha doin’?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Scoundrel! How dare you speak to our lord in that manner?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The one who answered Trike’s question was not Milton, but his escort knight behind him, Jerome. An ordinary person would be overwhelmed by Jerome’s vigor and become disheartened, but…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hang on, what’s the big deal with saying something when I’m just being eyeballed without a word?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike was also a man of fiery temperament.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Trike’s repeated demands, Jerome glared at Trike and warned him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mind your manners. Do you know who is the one before you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who? Why, he’s the one that got hit by my arrow and fell off his horse of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You dare…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It seemed that Jerome was ready to jump in the cell immediately and beat the living daylights out of Trike.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Milton raised his hand and held Jerome back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is fine, Jerome. He’s technically not wrong, would you not agree?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But my lord…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I say it is fine, then it is fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Milton said that, Jerome stepped back for the time being.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton smiled at Trike and spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I must apologize for staring at you so stiffly. Tis’ my first time seeing the man who landed an arrow on my face, so this is all rather intriguing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike looked at Milton with a hint of surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the nobles that Trike had encountered until now had been arrogant and looked down on the common people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having been born with an innately prickly personality, he could never bring himself to flatter the nobles and always caused some friction. In particularly bad cases, he was even almost killed for blaspheming the name of a noble and whatnot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus to Trike, the ones people called nobles were beings he believed were fundamentally incompatible with him and were natural enemies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All that considered, his present situation was the absolute worst.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was locked up in a cell, and the noble in front of him had almost died by his hands not long ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Why isn’t this noble showing any hostility?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rather than hostility, it went so far as feeling his friendliness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike was the type of person that needed to ask right away to satisfy his curiosity if he had any questions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why aren’t you angry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why must I be angry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike smirked at Milton’s nonchalant counterquestion and retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well… wasn’t I just trying to kill you, Viscount?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That was only natural since we met as enemies on the battlefield. What use is there in harboring grudges when the war has ended?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then… what ‘bout me speaking oh-so-rudely to you right now, Viscount? The knight beside you looks like he’s tryna tear me apart with that look in his eyes, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm, my good friend here is rather staunch. I myself do not particularly mind so pay him not heed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Milton replied coolly, Trike chortled and made a remark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re a pretty strange noble.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am this way by nature. As are you, are you not?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Me? What… do you mean…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“An ordinary mercenary would not act so casually in front of a noble – even more so when their life is in said noble’s hands.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm… then tis’ my nature as well, I figure.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Very good. Then how about us strange people have a little chat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, Milton released Trike from his cell and moved him to the sitting room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jerome did not seem particularly pleased with Trike’s attitude towards Milton, but he did not go against his lord Milton’s will.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arriving at the sitting room, Milton asked the attendant to bring some tea before starting his talk with Trike.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You wouldn’t want this to drag along, I assume?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Certainly not.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I shall get straight to the point. How about you join my ranks?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Milton’s words, Trike had a sip of the tea and frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not like this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Which part of my proposal do you not-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, not that – I’m talking about this bitter water you call ‘tea’. For the life of me, I don’t get how you noble misters and misses enjoy drinking this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Judging from his expression, it seemed he really was displeased with the tea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though Milton merely thought that Trike was an amusing individual, Jerome’s temper was rising from his spot standing behind Milton. As Jerome exuded a murderous vibe, Trike corrected himself with a more serious expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmm… Viscount, what do you mean by joining your ranks? A contractual agreement as a mercenary? If not that…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What I mean is that I formally appoint you to a position in our lands and you become one of my men.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. Can I take that as you saying my archery is highly valued?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Milton’s words, Trike nodded with a pleased expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He hasn’t completely detached himself from a desire for fame. It looks like he still enjoys having his skills acknowledged.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was forming a picture of Trike’s mindset as he observed his opponent’s demeanor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike seemed to think for a while before speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have three conditions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, tell me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike earnestly began at Milton’s consent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“First and foremost: I expect all my lads to be taken care of as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you mean the Longbow Company?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I shall see to it happening. They will be recruited as soldiers of my lands.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not talking about one or two members but 200 men. Coupled with their families as well, it should be around 500 people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I shall support them with resettlement funds and provide a place to live.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike was a little surprised at Milton’s smooth answers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Does he have the guts? Or is he just that good at lying?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There had been a considerable number of nobles until now who witnessed Trike’s archery and offered him recruitment upon recognizing his value or uniqueness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Each time, Trike had proposed the same conditions – but the number of nobles who accepted the first condition could be be counted on one hand. This was because there were many lords who were reluctant to let wild mercenaries become established in their lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aren’t you worried? My boys are as rough as they come for mercenaries.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Only ensure they obey the law. If they do not, they shall be punished according to county law. Would that be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…no. It is not.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike calmly nodded. This one named Milton Forrest before him seemed to be of better character than he initially took him for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had a smooth-sailing personality with clear lines when it came to serious business; and Trike also liked that he did not fuss over the small details.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Trike started to see the benefits of serving under Milton, he was tempted to be over with it and accept Milton’s proposal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But up until now, there was not a single noble who had accepted his second condition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They all scoffed at him and asked if it was a jest or cursed him in a fit of anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whenever this happened, Trike would say time and again that they needed a fresh pair of eyes, but even he now knew: that is, of how unfathomable his request was to the nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike had to say it regardless, with the anticipation that this time could somehow be different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Onto my second condition: formally acknowledge me as a knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘How’s that? Can you really accept this as well?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was written on Trike’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton responded immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you wish. I shall see to it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the third?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the third? Why do you not speak?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike was barely able to answer after Milton had shocked him out of his wits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you… hear what I said? I asked for the title of a knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And I said as you wish. Might you have other qualms with this arrangement?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Qualms? I’m… I’m an archer. You know, right? I don’t know a rat’s ass about swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you a complete beginner?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Well, I could probably stand toe-to-toe with a 3</span><span>rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;class mercenary using a dagger. But… I’m mostly a fool with nothing to show other than my archery.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton only shrugged in response as Trike listed off his weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yet you have such brilliant archery, so much so that it threatened my life. I intend to accept you on that valued basis. What is the problem?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My god, you’re serious.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike was astonished. This was the first time such a thing was happening in his life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Milton Forrest was sincerely recognizing his marksmanship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike teared up a little, and the life that he had lived flashed by him like shadows dancing across a lamp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Trike was originally the son of a hunter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a result, he naturally learned to use bows from his father as a child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the very first time he laid his eyes on a bow, he was instantly entranced. He liked its sleek design and the feeling of pulling back on the string.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he let go of the bowstring, the arrow would cut through the air and cleanly fly forwards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The thrill he derived from an arrow perfectly hitting its target completely enthralled the young Trike.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike’s father found his archery commendable and decided to teach him all there was to know about the craft. He had the aptitude and talent for archery, and had the all the prerequisites to be trained in this art.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike’s archery would make enormous leaps and bounds day by day. If he had continued developing at that rate, he would likely have become an excellent hunter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Trike’s father died in an accident when he was fifteen. He had made a critical mistake while hunting and was consequently unable to detect the approaching of a monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The death of Trike’s father brought many changes for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He threw away his future as a hunter and resolved to live seeking greater successes. Subsequently, he enlisted in a war as an archer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Archers were troops that were recruited solely for their archery. On the battlefield, they were treated modestly better than regular foot soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, no matter how well they were treated, a soldier was but a soldier in the end. No matter how significant a role Trike played on the frontiers, that never led to an actual distinguishment of his service.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[It’s true, sir. My arrow’s the one that punched a hole straight through that knight’s eye.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[I was deliberately aiming for the enemy commander’s horse with my bow. It was no stroke of luck.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Yes, that was my arrow. I tell you; I really was aiming for him.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike would assert till his voice became hoarse, but all that returned were denouncements of his claims as nothing but lies as reception of him slowly descended into contempt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The time he hit a moving knight in his eye, directly through the slit of his helmet…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The time he knocked an enemy off his horse in the middle of an intense battle…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His marksmanship was simply too removed from common sense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how many achievements he garnered on the battlefield, no glory would return to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Realizing this after three years of toiling away as an archer, Trike quit being a soldier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead, he became a mercenary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he marketed himself as a mercenary on the basis of his ability – and made distinguished contributions in this role – he thought his skills would be acknowledged and respected. He was also all the more confident in his marksmanship, which improved as he partook in the battlefields.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In actuality, Trike did leave an extraordinary mark when he began working as a mercenary. The movements and actions of a mercenary were much more prone to catch one’s eye than a soldier acting as just one man of a whole.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a result, nobles that recognized Trike’s capabilities began appearing, who would send Trike recruitment offers…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Offers to be an ordinary soldier.</span></p>
