 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What happened? We want the details.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The command staff asked the messenger for the sequence of events.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The messenger paced his breathing and explained composedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy raided a position where we were managing our supplies, but they were successfully repelled with minimal damage. Afterwards, Sir Gayle pursued the withdrawing enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pursued? We have prohibited overextensions through military decree, have we not?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. However, Sir Gayle made an assessment as the on-site commander that he could commence a chase with his order of knights.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He overextended then. And what was the outcome?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They encountered enemies that were lying in ambush and entered battle. In the midst of battle however, Sir Gayle says he caught sight of enemies that were wearing the black, skull-shaped helmets, as well as Siegfried who is designated as a high-priority target.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans rose from his seat and shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where are they located?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They are deep within the forest located southeast of our encampments.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The southeast? Is that not in the direction we marched from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You cannot possibly be suggesting that they have been observing our movements until now from the rear…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that how they were able to so accurately grasp our openings? Such an audacious plan…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commanders exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They had committed to performing extensive reconnaissance in order to find the enemy’s main encampment. Of course, proceeding with recon in a mountainous region – with the Hildess Republic as their opponent – was not an easy task.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whenever a recon unit was dispatched, less than half the unit would return alive. Nevertheless, they shouldered the sacrifices and pushed ahead with their scouting to find the enemy’s camp no matter the cost.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">… and now, it was clear that it was all in vain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After their very first encounter, the enemy had scattered towards the direction from which the Strabus army had advanced from. In other words, they had set up in the rear and were carrying out their guerilla operations from there.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a frighteningly bold and elaborate plan. Subsequently, no recon unit they operated could find them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, however…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ready the army at once. No – until then, I shall go first. All knights and other men who are with me at present, follow my lead.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that they had discovered the enemy’s position, they could hammer down with a full-fledged attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;made haste, one of the commanders alarmedly halted the Duke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Grace, this is dangerous. We have no more than 3,000 men present with us at this camp. There lies a significant risk in attacking the enemy’s main site with a force of this size.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the Duke did not listen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“3000 men will be enough. Besides, the enemy would have dispersed their troops to wage their guerilla war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That may be so, but…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If the bastards relocate their camp and conceal themselves again as we speak, we are finished. Move it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans shoved his commander to the side with a bellow and exited the tent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Until now, he had calmly followed his commanders’ opinions as there was no clear course of action. However, he now intended to wage this war his way with the enemy’s position finally discovered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All knights, with me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uooooh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sprung into action, personally leading the troops.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the Duke arrived on the scene, their troops were still engaged in brutal combat with the enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s Siegfried!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Catch him! Getting him will be the greatest accomplishment of this war!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the soldiers and knights were reinvigorated when they saw Siegfried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">War was, in some respects, a shot at success and climbing the status ladder in the Strabus Kingdom. In particular, if an individual designated as a high-priority target by the kingdom was captured or killed, the one responsible received an enormous reward regardless of their societal rank.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, there had been occasions where the lowliest of soldiers would kill such a target and receive a noble title. One of the distinct features of Strabus Kingdom culture was that rewards were given for distinguished services regardless of one’s rank or status. The only exception were foreigners, such as Milton who had been stationed on the Western Front.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only, while such opportunities to advance in society instilled courage in the soldiers, it also had the effect of disorganizing their formations. The battle lines fell into disarray as rogue soldiers sensed a chance at glory and dashed out, nullifying their strength in numbers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These soldiers could not come close to Siegfried, and were one-sidedly cut down by the Black Skulls that were protecting his position.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘None can do.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Quickly discerning the present situation, Duke Brans thundered as he personally galloped forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pull the troops back! They distract me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The moment the on-site knights heard the Duke’s voice, their morale surged forth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Grace has arrived!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All men, make way! Do not obstruct the Duke!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Knowing Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;combat style, the knights looked out for their soldiers without being told to do so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In more normal times, the Duke was an ordinary man who was not particularly considerate but not harsh either.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, whenever he flipped the switch and entered battle mode, he&nbsp;</span><span>metamorphized</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;into a completely different man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“URRRRAAAAH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;galloped forward with a wild roar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Dududududu…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No one lingered around his path as he swung his sword all over the place. His thunderous charge, with no room to discriminate between friend or foe, could not even be stopped by the resilient Black Skulls.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kuh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The defensive lines of the Black Skulls collapsed as they were unable to withstand his attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Follow the Duke!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Exterminate these Republican dogs!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the greatest reason that Masters were so valued on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No ordinary soldier could impede a Master that was wreaking havoc in combat. Of course, even a Master could be felled if there was the time and resources to surround them for sufficiently long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this would only work if the enemy solely consisted of one Master. Who would stand still and watch as an enemy’s formation was destroyed?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Die, you dogs of the Republic!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We will slaughter you all!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With wrathful vengeance, the Strabus Kingdom’s knights and soldiers ruggedly collided with the enemy. While the Black Skulls were individually strong, they could not possibly stop their enemy’s offensive after their formation had collapsed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eventually, Siegfried issued his order of withdrawal. His special forces unit escorted him and they began drawing back at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pursue them! We absolutely mustn’t let them get away!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Of course, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had no intentions of allowing them to go scot-free.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the enemy’s retreat was exceedingly fast and well-organized. Even as they scattered in all sorts of directions, the promptness and smoothness with which they retreated was almost as if they had organized their groups beforehand. It seemed it would be difficult to cause significant damage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This cannot be. We barely caught onto them…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Forgetting everything else, Siegfried at the very least had to be eliminated at all costs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason that the Strabus Kingdom’s Duke became involved in the strife of a small nation such as the Lester Kingdom in the first place was because of Siegfried. Due to the designs arising from his mind, they lost their chance to destroy the Hildess Republic once and for all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not only that, but the expedition troops were devastated and the Republicans broke through the Northern Front to trample over their national lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried was rightfully designated by the Strabus Kingdom as their number one priority target, and this was when he was yet to fully bloom his reputation in the Republic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then how much of a threat would he become if he were to assume the reins of real power?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘He will be captured here without fail.’</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;decided to overextend himself just a little in order to catch Siegfried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All knights, follow my lead! We shall pursue the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans and the knights started to give chase.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Duke Brans did consider that this could be the enemy’s attempt at luring him in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he believed that he could break through any trap they could have set and continued to spur his horse forth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Siegfried, the enemy is hot on our tail.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried listened to his subordinate’s report even as he sped his horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Is Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with them?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, he is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And how are their forces?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“40 men are assumed to be knights, accompanied by a cavalry force of what looks to be 1000 horsemen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then there would likely be infantrymen as well, though they would be lagging behind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried ran some quick calculations as he galloped on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We can catch him. Lure him into the designated point.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;slowly closed the distance with the enemy he was chasing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A pursuit situation such as this was advantageous for them. This was because the Hildess Republic’s cavalry were, in fact, famously awful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As most of their lands were covered by mountains, the topography did not lend itself to operating a cavalry unit and they were few and far between. Thus while the Hildess Republic’s mountaineers were known for their high standards, their mounted troops were rather the converse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With both the quality of their horses and riding skills being inferior to the Strabus cavalry, the distance between them was surely but slowly closing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And when the distance between them finally closed…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Turn the tables!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They stopped fleeing, and turned around to charge at their pursuers instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So they come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was ready, having anticipated that something like this would happen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The enemy was few in number anyhow. At most, they likely had somewhere around the range of 300 horsemen. While the Black Skulls were elite soldiers, Brans was not intimidated when he was accompanied by his own elite unit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Nothing but a meaningless struggle.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was sure of his victory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it was then…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Something completely unbelievable happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Siegfried’s signal, a vivid aura started spewing from the enemy’s weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not just one or two, but all 300 soldiers without fail.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It-it cannot be!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All were bewildered at this sudden spectacle of 300 Experts. Regardless of whether they were bewildered or not, the 300 Experts came thundering towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“AAAAAARGH!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The brutal sounds and screams of destruction emanated from everywhere, as this black tide enveloped the sandcastle that was the Strabus detachment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While Siegfried’s Ghosts were inferior in number, they were the ones that perfectly dominated and trampled over their enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What… what is this…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was shocked senseless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A special unit that was all Experts?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Such a thing had been unheard of.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Bran fought against the coming tide and even felled a few Ghosts himself, but that was not enough to reverse this situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if he himself was able to withstand the attack, Experts were a calamity for regular cavalry and knights who had not reached the Expert level.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And there were 300 of them…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This just isn’t something that could happen. Unless they gathered every single Expert in the Hildess Republic to this one spot, how could…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Deep in shock, Duke Brans could not command an adequate response – and Siegfried was not going to wait for him to regain his bearings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>A deadly swing came slicing through the air towards him. Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;reflexively raised his sword to block it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">KLANG!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After their clash, his opponent used his attack’s recoil to bounce back quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans clenched his teeth as his entire lower arm was numbed by the impact.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s strong.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked at his enemy with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Who may&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">be?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the titan of a man who had been together with Siegfried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I go by the name of Jake, Captain of the Ghost Special Corps.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ghost? Might you be the captain of these skulls?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As they conversed, Duke Brans scrupulously observed his adversary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And while he did not let it show on the outside, he was greatly surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had an idea after they exchanged blows, but he did not want to accept the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This man… surely he’s not a…?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed he is a Master.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The one who confirmed Duke Brans’ fears was Siegfried, who came up from behind Jake with a cool expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No… I won’t believe such a lie-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Fsssh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With one word, a blade made of aura was brought to life around Jake’s colossal sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;watched the colorful aura blade, the symbolic technique of Masters, in sheer disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you can see, he is a Master as you are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;ground his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Siegfried…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is an honor that you know of my name, Duke Derek Brans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was simmering.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Were you always hiding this trump card up your sleeve? A special unit consisting only of Experts, with a Master that has been hidden from the world until now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have laboriously prepared to hunt the titan that is a man such as yourself. Quite alright if I do say so myself, would you not agree?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph. This far exceeds ‘quite alright’. Did you fear me so much that you prepared to this extent?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is due to my rather cautious nature.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the short time that they conversed, the rest of the scene had already been settled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Almost all the soldiers that accompanied Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;on his pursuit had fallen to the blade of a Ghost. Some of the knights were still doggedly fighting back, but they too were only a matter of time.</span></p>
