 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this what you would call fanaticism?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton frowned as he watched the Republic’s foolhardy charge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How frightening. And beyond that… it’s simply unpleasant.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People who gave their lives for an ideal were considered noble. But if that ideology was nothing more than a lie, the sacrifice would be in vain for what amounted to a farce.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Utopia? Have a load of these guys.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whether it was Republicanism or Royalism, or even the democracy that Milton experienced in his previous life…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the world of humans, one well thought-out idea was not going to materialize as a utopia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An idea was just that: an idea. Complications were bound to arise if it was applied to reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To that end, it irritated and unsettled Milton to watch these men give their lives in the name of a utopia that would never exist. It was becoming difficult to watch if he was to be honest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jerome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take the knights and make a sortie. Smash straight through the enemy’s center.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jerome prepared the knight’s order at once. All the knights of the South gathered, having already garnered many remarkable contributions on the battlefield in this war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Southern knights now consisted of not only Milton and Jerome’s knights, but the additional knights sent by the nobles of the Southern region. With Princess Leila’s knights also added for support, this current rendition of the knight order was Milton’s trump card for frontal matches.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are we ready?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You only need to give us the word.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton tightly put on and secured his helmet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Charge!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so the knight’s charge began.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For the Repub- GAH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop… stop them!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were reminiscent of a wild shark gnashing through a great wave. With Milton personally at the forefront, they cut through the Republican soldiers with their terrifying momentum. Though they were fanatics that were marching forth with no regard for their own lives, there was a difference in strength which could not be overcome through morale alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Including Milton and Jerome, the knight’s order of the Southern army had over ten Experts alone. As they wreaked havoc amongst the enemy line using their aura, forty knights who were yet to be Experts but were certainly not lacking followed up from behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a force that simply could not be handled by run-of-the-mill soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The battle lines collapsed, and the knights did not find the disorganized troops to be threatening no matter how high their morale was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our lord has created a golden opportunity for us. Fire!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Right on cue, Trike commanded his archer unit with a bellow. There was no need to be sparing with their arrows. This was the time to pile it on to maximize their results.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“AAAAGH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“KAAAH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even these troops who had been advancing relentlessly like zombies could only be daunted by the arrows showering upon them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This battle was already as good as decided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though there stood a chance for the Republican army’s peculiar and frantic charge to cause some serious damage, the knights’ charge and Trike’s rear support nullified it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was only one thing left now: to take the head of the enemy commander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where is Milton Forrest!?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred thundered as he fought in the fray. One knight answered his call and rushed to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I shall be your opponent!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred narrowed his eyes at the knight who approached him with a pompous shout.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you Milton Forrest?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why should our lord meddle with the likes of you? I am Rick Storie. Remember it well when I send you on your way to the next world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was one of Milton’s close men, Rick. Alfred’s eyebrow twitched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘How dare he…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With the battle already lost, he was braced to fight until his death. Despite this resolve, a man much below his rank was coming at him, seeing him as easy pickings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were few conditions more apt for pissing someone off on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This brat!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred imbued his sword with a healthy amount of aura and swung.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">KLANG!!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the first time in his life, Rick Storie experienced the attack of an Expert with a sincere intent to kill. Of course, he had been bent over backwards countless times when sparring with Jerome and Milton, but actual combat was different from practice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the least, his training experience allowed him to avoid being cut clean by this single blow – but his resultant state was unsightly nonetheless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With merely a single blow, Rick was knocked off his horse, his sword broken and his armor cut open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He barely managed to keep down the blood that was forcing its way through his esophagus and stood back up, albeit with trembling legs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite his sorry state, Alfred’s merciless swing came flying once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick figured this was where he would meet his end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A thought rushed through his head questioning whether this was really how he was going to die, after having lived his whole life without fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thankfully however, it seemed that day would not be today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Klang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One man appeared in front of Rick and blocked Alfred’s attack. Without a hint of wavering from defending the strike, he confidently faced Alfred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Realizing this opponent would not be as easy, Alfred drew back with his horse and shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And who may you be?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His adversary responded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Milton Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hoh… So you are Count Forrest?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed I am.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton nodded at his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you can see, the battle has completely tipped in our favor. Would you not like to surrender and save your men’s lives, at the least?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As an answer, Alfred readied his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You jest! Every last one of us will fight valiantly to become a cornerstone of a utopia to be realized one day.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton stormily muttered under his breath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“F**k me, what a load of bullshit…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did the likes of you just…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A fire lit inside Alfred’s eyes with his righteousness stained, and he was about to object. But Milton no longer felt the need to exchange words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Enough. If you truly have no intention of surrendering, taking your head will be the fastest path to ending this battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred clenched his teeth and roared with fury.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s see you try!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two men collided with each other head-on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">KLANG!!<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ow… my ears!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shit, let’s back off. It’s a duel between Experts. Back off if you don’t want to get caught up.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shockwave of the two’s clash emanated throughout their surroundings. The clang was so deafening that the nearby soldiers were left with ringing ears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the soldiers instinctively drew back and formed a natural clearing…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Die, dog of kingdoms!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You first!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two began exchanging blows in full swing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Klang! Kakakaka… KLANG!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sparks flew with an ear-splitting boom whenever their auras collided. The horses were not able to withstand the force of the blows and were pushed backwards with every exchange.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The swings were so fast that they only flashed with trails of light to the ordinary human eye, yet the subjects of these strikes somehow dodged or deflected them with skill. With the fire of combat lit, the men around them could not intervene even if they wanted to. In fact, the exchange was so tight that rashly jumping in could actually be disadvantageous for their side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick blankly watched the unfolding spectacle from a relative distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rick, you old bear. Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rick Storie, I ask you – are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead of answering the approaching Tommy, Rick vacantly murmured to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was the lord always that strong?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tommy seemed to relate to him, for he simply did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Tommy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As knights under the direct command of House Forrest, these two were being treated beyond their abilities inside the Southern army. It was only to be expected, as the two were not only knights directly under the army’s head Count Forrest, but were also his close entourage – and friends. Not only did the other knights show the requisite respect, but the nobles of the Southern army could not treat them mindlessly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Tommy believed they knew Milton better than anyone in the world, having watched him for as much as they were close to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the Milton Forrest before them now was not the person they knew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When did he get so strong before they knew it?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His opponent looked to be a mid-level Expert at the minimum, yet Milton was standing toe-to-toe with such a strong enemy. No, it wasn’t just that – as time went on, it seemed he was slowly grasping at a prospect of victory. The number of Milton’s attacks was increasing, while the enemy began to be pushed backwards inch by inch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was strong. Rick and Tommy already knew Milton was strong, but not to this extent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The talent that Milton originally possessed, along with the grit he developed upon awakening his past self as Park Moon-Soo, on top of his commitment and having a brilliant teacher in Jerome Taker at his side – all of this culminated in Milton’s current strength of a mid-level Expert.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Purely based&nbsp;</span><span>off</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his swordsmanship, he had reached the level where he could likely compete with upper-level Experts without a particular area of lacking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Tommy resolved as they witnessed Milton’s skill.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’m not leaving…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘…things like this.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Rick and Tommy desperately wished to become stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">KLANG!!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred narrowly deflected Milton’s powerful swing and backed off with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s strong.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, Alfred merely thought that this would not be an easy opponent, but now he clearly sensed their difference in ability. Their auras were of a similar strength, but there was a noticeable gap in the sophistication of their swordsmanship as well as their ability to read the other’s movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was going to lose at this rate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he could not slay the enemy commander at the least, this battle would go down in the records as a miserable and complete defeat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I can’t let that be.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred resolved.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This is the last fight of my life anyhow.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton watched Alfred seem to resign himself to his fate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is your last chance to surrender. I promise that I shall spare your lives at the least.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred did not answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead, he took out a small vial within his armor and downed it in a single gulp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What’s that?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a second, Milton suspected that Alfred was committing suicide by poisoning himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aura lingering on Alfred’s blade suddenly surged forth with increased intensity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is this? …What have you done?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was taken aback, but there was no time to process it as Alfred rushed at him once again with a roar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“None of your business. DIE!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wildly charged.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Siegfried entrusted the Western army to Alfred, he handed him a small vial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he did so, he said…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[This is a special brew recently developed at the weapons department. There’s room left for improvement, but as it is, it will temporarily enhance one’s strength beyond their usual abilities by bringing out their latent potential.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred was astonished. He had no idea that the military would consider developing such a concoction in his wildest dreams. He was worried on one hand, as a potion with such a powerful effect would certainly have an equally significant downside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he asked about this, Siegfried did not deny him and told him the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[The side effect is simple. The user will die.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred found this ludicrous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">You died when you drank it? Was this not more like a poison than a potion?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried continued as he saw Alfred’s expression of incredulity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[There’s nothing much we can do about it at present, as the potion is still in development. I suppose it will improve one day.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Alfred took the steroid from Siegfried for now, he thought to himself that he would never end up using this concoction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘You never know what can happen.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alfred had taken the potion to go out blazing with a last, desperate struggle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh… What on earth did you just drink, you bastard?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not something that you need to know!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Any calmness that was evident on Milton’s face was wiped clean. The speed and destructive power behind Alfred’s attacks were unrecognizably strong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Never minding skill, the power of Alfred’s aura equaled an upper-level or even a top-grade Expert. Every time Milton received a strike, it felt like his sword was going to rip out of his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I can’t believe this is the state of things even when I’m trying my best to deflect it…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whatever the unidentified drink was, his enemy had suddenly become stronger. Milton could not escape Alfred’s attempts at engagement in this situation that was completely outside his expectations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Wouldn’t it all be for naught if my head goes flying when we’ve won the battle?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Milton ground his teeth. All that had become stronger was the enemy’s aura and not his combat prowess. He had to endure the blows with whatever techniques at his disposal and find an opening in the meantime.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Focus… Let’s focus.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everything in his peripheral disappeared as Milton solely focused all his concentration on his blade.</span></p>
