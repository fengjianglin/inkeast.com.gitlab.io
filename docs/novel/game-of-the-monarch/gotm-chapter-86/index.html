 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried ground his teeth. He never thought he’d get stabbed in the back like this. He had believed that the Southern Army would be secretly maneuvering themselves to try and keep him in check. Who would have thought they’d attack him head-on like this? But since the Führer himself sent down the orders to retreat, he couldn’t go against it. However…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’m gonna go crazy.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Within half a year, no, three months if they pushed hard, they would have been able to break the Lester Kingdom. But&nbsp;</span><span>to have</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to pull out now…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried tightly closed his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And when he reopened them…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Neither anger nor resentment could be seen in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried’s position in the Republic was merely the Fuhrer’s secretary right now. There were limits to what he could do in his current position and power. No matter how stupid and incomprehensible the orders from above were, there wasn’t anything he could do about it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since that was the case, it would be best for him to stop dragging his feet and start thinking about the future. However, even if his brain knew that, it was difficult to actually accept it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried could do it. He was someone who could fully control his emotions with reason. He quickly gave up on the inevitable and immediately made two moves. The first was to pick a path of retreat and begin preparing for it. And the second was to…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Burn everything!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Set everything on fire and tear it all apart. Don’t leave a single piece of civilization behind!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Lady Sophia, a virtuoso of architecture under Milton’s command, saw this, she would have cried. In the midst of retreat, the Republican soldiers were thoroughly destroying Lorentia, the capital of the Lester Kingdom. It is said that a country’s capital is the embodiment of the history and culture of that country. And Siegfried had thoroughly destroyed that capital. He had gathered all the goods, such as important books and treasures, that he could gather, and the architecture and urban infrastructure that he couldn’t carry out, he had ordered it to all be destroyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although it may seem barbaric, it only seemed natural to the warring Republicans. As long as the occupation of a territory failed, it became the territory of the enemy again. Then, from the Republic’s point of view, it absolutely couldn’t be returned back to the enemy unscathed. They had to thoroughly destroy and inflict as much damage as possible to the enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After destroying the capital, Siegfried led his army and retreated. But even as he was retreating, his eyes were stubborn as always. It was as if his eyes were saying it wasn’t over yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It's a complete victory. The Republican bastards are all retreating.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s good to hear.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton sighed as he heard about the Republican’s retreat from Bianca.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But there’s also bad news.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bad news? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The bastards completely burnt down the Capital as they retreated.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton let out a sigh as he accepted it. Their situation wasn’t great enough to recover the capital without paying a price. The Lester Kingdom had barely survived from the brink of destruction. But even if the capital was destroyed, most of the citizens had taken refuge with Princess Leila and were safe. In which case, didn’t they get off easily considering how they were on the brink of ruin? That was how much of a crisis the Lester Kingdom had been in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton and the Southern Army’s strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila’s leadership.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian’s shrewd tactics.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If even one of them had been missing, the Lester Kingdom would have become history.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The future is the important thing.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Including the capital and the Northern region that had been invaded by the Republicans, the entire country had been heavily damaged. It would take a lot of time and effort to heal and repair the damages that had been left behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Either way, the country has been saved and it’s time for us to return.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton immediately called over Jerome to give him instructions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jerome, tell the entire army that we’re returning back to our country.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Following Milton’s orders, the Southern Army immediately headed down south. They were finally returning home.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But even as they were returning, they had to be cautious. In order to avoid any more meaningless battles when the actual war had ended, Milton had picked his route back as carefully as possible. He had surveilled the Republican forces’ movements to avoid them and any more battles and aimed for the smoothest return back to his country. He had definitely chosen the best route for the best retreat possible, but then…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How did this happen?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had almost crossed the Republican border when Siegfried appeared in front of his eyes with a Republican army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you think we’d just let you go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Siegfried glanced at the prey in front of his eyes. He had put in quite a bit of effort to devour the Lester Kingdom. But&nbsp;</span><span>it had failed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, it wasn’t a war without results. They had burned the capital of the Lester Kingdom and destroyed a large part of the country. They had caused a lot of damage to the country, but most importantly, the Republic had destroyed 50,000 of the Strabus Kingdom, the Republic’s biggest enemy. If the war’s purpose had been to weaken their enemy’s power, then it hadn’t been a pointless war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the problem was that they hadn’t gained anything either. The original plan had been to take over the Lester Kingdom and create a bridgehead that would stretch into the southern part of the continent, but that plan failed. There were several reasons for the plan failing, but one of them was the Southern Army led by Milton Forrest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Republic had never thought there would be such a person in a country that had been drowning in peace like the Lester Kingdom had been.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila and Milton Forrest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried believed that if either one of them was dealt with now, it would be better for their future plans regarding the Lester Kingdom. And so, he had immediately moved his army to capture Milton. But the army that had been sent to get them had kept missing, and instead, kept being thwarted by the enemy’s movements. Milton had once again used Bianca’s magic to surveil the enemy’s movements from the sky as a hawk to avoid running into the enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It’s like that, huh?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried immediately changed the way he reacted. He didn’t know how, but it seemed as though the enemy had a long range reconnaissance. In which case, he would react with the opposite method from before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Siegfried sent out carrier pigeons in all directions and created a blockade net. This wasn’t a net meant to enclose the enemy, but one that was meant to block their path and limit their path of retreat. Siegfried might not have been on site, but with the usage of the carrier pigeons, he was able to give instructions as though he was there. His ability to predict went beyond genius to&nbsp;</span><span>god-like</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. This was his true face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, Siegfried had decided to give it his all to capture Milton. Eventually, as though he was the fox in a fox hunt, Milton had unknowingly been herded in front of Siegfried. That was the situation right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It can’t be helped. It’ll be difficult to avoid it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had confirmed that the enemy was well prepared. It seemed as though the enemy had decided to wait for them. In which case, retreating would only lead to greater damages.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jerome, prepare for battle. Get ready to welcome our guests.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord. All units in formation!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Milton had given the order, the Southern Army immediately settled into their formation in an orderly manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What an elite force.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Watching the Southern Army’s movements, Siegfried nodded as he admired them. Originally, the Southern Army wasn’t an army that could boast such excellent discipline. Although Milton had put in a lot of effort to train the soldiers from Forrest Territory, there were more soldiers who had been mercenaries hired by Princess Leila and private soldiers from other lords who had never experienced a war before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But, a true elite soldier was born from experience. In addition, throughout this war, the Southern Army had continued to win over and over again. The victories had given them confidence and boosted morale. The current Southern Army undeniably deserved to be praised as an elite force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But that’s all you are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried was confident. He raised his sword and pointed it towards the enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brothers of the Republic, let the invaders pay the price!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wahhhhh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Republicans began to advance while yelling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Send the Republicans bastards to hell!! Advance!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wahhhhh!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And under Milton’s command, the Southern Army also advanced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although they themselves wouldn’t know this now, all the historians would say the same thing in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton Forrest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the first battle between the two heroes.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the infantry of both armies clashed, it was the Southern Army led by Milton that took the lead first.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Defeat the Republican dogs!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How dare you burn down our Capital?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kill them all. Kill all these sons of bitches!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Southern Army roughly fought against their enemy. Watching his men being defeated too easily by the Southern Army’s infantry, Siegfried frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The command system isn’t working properly. Why aren’t the field commanders responding?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason the Republican’s infantry was being pushed so easily was because of the junior commanders in the field. Sergeant, Staff Sergeant, and Sergeant First Class. None of them were able to command their men. Siegfried was immediately told why the field commanders weren’t able to order their men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The field commanders who’re supposed to be leading the infantry on the front line are dying too quickly, Sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried couldn’t understand it. Of course, there was a high mortality rate for the commanders who fought alongside the soldiers and gave immediate commands in the battlefield. But the two armies had just begun to fight, so how could there already be so many fatalities that it affected the command structure?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Something’s strange.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was one only reason for the rapid deaths of the commanders of the Republican Army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Finally working after a long while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Creeak</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A red haired man pulling on the bowstrings of a large longbow. The moment he lets go of the taut bowstring…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Twang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A clear sound rang through the air, and at the same time, an arrow flew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And then…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be frightened. Protect each other in concentrated defense formation… gah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the Republican sergeants who had been commanding the infantry in a loud voice was shot in the neck. The arrow had found a crevice in his armor and accurately pierced through his neck. He fell to the ground and closed his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nice. Who should I shoot next?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike looked for his next prey with a sharp smile and piercing eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having lost their commander to Trike’s arrow, the Republican Army’s infantry was greatly pushed back. But the Republicans weren’t that easy to let the Southern army snatch a victory over something like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take down the enemy’s flank. Send a signal to the ambushing team.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Siegfried’s order, a group of men suddenly appeared on the Southern Army’s left flank and began to rush forward. They were the elite mountain force that the Hildes Republic was so proud of. Originally, they were a reconnaissance platoon unit and fought small-scale battles in the mountains, but on the battlefield, they were stronger operating together in a bigger group. A single Hildes Republic’s mountain force soldier was strong enough to deal with four or five ordinary soldiers by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But of course, Milton wasn’t foolish enough to fall for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jerome, lead the knights and block the West.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Block elite soldiers with elite soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing how he was winning the battle between infantries, it would make no difference if Milton removed the knights. Milton’s response was formulaic and right. But because of that…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I got you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried was already expecting that. No, more accurately, he had influenced that?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jake, give the signal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried gave the order to his right-hand man. Then, a group of soldiers appeared on the right side of the Southern Army. They had prepared ambushes on either side of the southern army and attacked them at different times. The first side had been bait to lure out the knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Charge!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The goal is Milton Forrest’s neck!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were approximately 500 soldiers who had appeared on the right side of the Southern Army. The number of soldiers themselves weren’t many. They quickly charged to the right flank of the Southern Army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you dare say was your goal?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You think you’re funny? Kill them all!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles commanding the right flank of the Southern Army immediately responded. Since there were only 500 troops, the nobles thought they would be able to fight back with the soldiers already on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But they were wrong. There were about 30 special forces leading in the 500 men. The nobles hadn’t known about the men wearing black skull-shaped armor. They were known as Ghost Force, a special force specially trained by Siegfried. This was his real attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Drink the elixir before entering the fight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the command of the man leading the Ghost Force, the other Ghosts took out elixirs from inside their armors and drank it. It felt as though energy was instantly bursting within their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ten will be in the front using Aura. The rest will follow in the back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. We’re going in!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Baang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried’s special force struck the right flank of the Southern Army.&nbsp;</span></p>
