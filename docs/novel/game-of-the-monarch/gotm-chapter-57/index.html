 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a night raid!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though the army of the First Prince was having difficulties in capturing Fortress Baikal, they had nevertheless exclusively been the ones on the offensive until now. Naturally, the commanders began to let their guard down, and the soldiers showed gaps on guard duty due to their fatigue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A detachment of the Second Prince’s army exploited this lapse in judgment to attack them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Burn it all to the ground!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pay back all we have endured tenfold!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span>Uooooooooh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">Surprised by this sudden night ambush, t</span>he royalist troops began to suffer significant damage. If there was a silver lining, it was that there weren't a lot of enemies and that the attacked site’s assigned commander was a capable man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do not be flustered!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander in charge of this site was a knight by the name of Saimon, who now personally drew his sword to enter combat with the enemy. He valiantly commanded the men and raised the troops’ morale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy is small in number! Face them and fight! Dispatch a messenger to let the main army know of this ambush! A hundred foot soldiers will follow my lead!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander’s shrewd response allowed the situation to stabilize relatively quickly as the soldiers regained their composure and followed his orders.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the damage had already been done.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are the casualties shaping up to be?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The casualties of our troops still need to be aggregated. But…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Five catapults were destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Saimon closed his eyes tightly at his subordinate’s report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It was a diversion from the start.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The enemy had infiltrated the camp with the objective of destroying the siege weapons. Though the attack had been repelled as best they could, the damage caused was too great.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">***</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next day…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“These fools! Behead the commander who could not prevent this raid at once, as well as the soldiers who were standing on guard duty – every last one of them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The First Prince’s order to behead them in his rage shocked and panicked Marquis Trauss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness, executing those responsible here will cause a disturbance in our soldiers’ morale. If a punishment is to be given, perhaps ordering them to be responsible for correcting their own errors would be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What responsibility can be entrusted to a so-called commander who cannot even adequately respond to a camp raid?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be that as it may…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Enough! This matter is closed. Carry out my will at once!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even Marquis Trauss’s remonstrations could not stop the First Prince’s stubbornness.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, the on-site commander and knight Saimon, as well as close to a hundred troops, were all decapitated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t this way overboard?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That good sir Saimon… he really was an upstanding man for a knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Precisely.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers were all stricken with fear and unease as they watched the procession. In their minds, notions of the First Prince’s cruelty and viciousness were being gradually cemented, and desertions from the army started picking up pace from this day forth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps it because they smelt blood in the first raid? But e</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">very night, guerilla detachments attacked the royalists’ encampments.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though they could not inflict the same amount of damage as the first night, the relentless raids put the First Prince’s troops more and more on edge. The commanders began to sense danger as morale slowly dropped and desertions grew in front of this iron castle that refused to fall.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Around the point that the commanders were determining that something had to be done…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shall we get started then?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried, the aide dispatched by the Republic, moved into action.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness, this is an emergency report.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A messenger came running to the First Prince, his face turned deathly pale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Count… Count Sainbridge, who was supervising the supplies, was killed in action, sir. The supplies themselves were all destroyed as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What madness is this?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prince shot up from his seat. How could the supply unit be attacked, when all of the Second Prince’s troops were presently holed up in Fortress Baikal?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Perhaps…?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prince suspected that someone out of the nobles tending to the rear had betrayed him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who could it be? Which bastard dared to betray me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the First Prince’s predictions were wrong. The ones who attacked the supplies were…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They were forces from the Hildes Republic, Your Highness. They have stepped into this war by attacking the supply unit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prince felt as if he was about to collapse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wha-… why would they…? Byron, you mongrel!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was only now that the First Prince finally realized why the Second Prince turned to Republicanism. The Hildes Republic had been part of this game from the start.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">***</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was an absolute worst-case situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The triumph after triumph garnered by the First’s army in the beginning of the war shaped up to all be a lie that caused them to be back into this corner. Not only was the morale of the royalist troops plummeting but the Hildes Republic had joined the war. The pillaging of the supply unit on top of that was a near-fatal blow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commanders quickly tried to control the flow of information, but all was leaked to the troops in time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it true that the Hildes Republic has joined the war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shit, word is that the supply unit was razed to the ground to boot.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that why we only have porridge for today’s rations?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it, who knows how long we’ll be having straight porridge. And that prince bastard has absolutely lost it, screeching at us to keep attacking…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“F**k!! Everything’s just absolutely f**ked.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian sighed as he watched word spread like wildfire among the men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The Republican blokes must have planted an agent among our troops. Is there no turning back at this rate?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact that information was spreading so fast despite the commanders employing regulatory measures meant that the spies of the Republic were already present amongst the men, or some of their men had converted and defected to the Republic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the Republicans always said:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[We are everywhere.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘They really are.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian shook his head and sighed again. He could not see a path to victory from this point. If anything, they could be witnessing the moment of this country’s downfall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">***</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, with their supplies destroyed, there was only one option left to them: to retreat with their remaining forces and decide where to go from there, even if that meant the civil war would be extended.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet the First Prince still refused to accept this reality, stubbornly asserting that all would end if they captured Fortress Baikal. He prolonged this headfirst war despite the efforts of the command staff to dissuade him, and consequently, they simply could not achieve a positive outcome. The Baikal Fortress did not budge even after ten days of relentless attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the enemy began their counterattack, they could not respond in equal measure and incurred continuous losses. It was to the point where the soldiers were surrendering more than they were fighting. Eventually, the First Prince mustered his remaining forces and tried to make his wretched retreat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That route of retreat was a living nightmare.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After having cut off their supply lines, the detachments from the Hildes Republic struck from the rear to reclaim the strongholds that had fallen into the royalists’ hands and set up camp, deploying troops along the First Prince’s escape route.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With the encamped Republican troops waiting wherever they went, they had no choice but to slaughter their warhorses after they ran dry of military rations. All the knights and nobles had to walk.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When even what little horse meat they had run out, the soldiers had no choice but to loot private residences in their vicinity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though they had set off with a force numbering 80,000 men, the defeated soldiers that returned in a pitiful state did not even amount to 5000.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahahahaha!! What a feat you have pulled indeed. Truly, you have displayed the prowess of the same Hildes Republic military that went toe-to-toe with the Strabus Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he had been backed to the edges of a precipice at one point, Byron, the Second Prince, was now firmly establishing the North as his domain after the First Prince’s army was completely decimated. Of course, he would be happy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now with the situation having reached this point, the Second Prince became tinged with greed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy has lost a substantial force of 80,000 and withdrawn. How about we go straight for the jugular and advance to the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Second Prince saw this as an opportunity from the heavens. While the First Prince's troops were having difficulties recovering from such a heavy blow, i<span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">f he used this gap to advance together with the Republican troops, then</span> it felt as if he could finally have it all in the palm of his hand. His greed knew no bounds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A brilliant insight. The enemy has most certainly lost a sizable force, as well as losing the goodwill of the people with the ransacking of homes on their retreat. This would be the most suitable of times to advance our army.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oooooh… you <span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">are</span> of the same opinion, my good sir?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though the prince was rejoicing in his delight, Siegfried sounded slightly troubled with his next words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be that as it may…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm? Is something the matter? Would there be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried smiled bitterly at the prince’s query, looking conflicted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Though I too wish to advance our troops, that authority does not lie with me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don't have the authority? Whatever do you mean by that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The order I received from my homeland was to aid Your Highness after you declared your Republican stance, and spread the notion of Republicanism to the rest of the Lester Kingdom. To that end, I was commanded to help protect your sphere of influence over the Lester Kingdom’s North.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If that’s so… does it mean you cannot lend your strength for an offensive on the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I must apologize. I truly believe that this is a fantastic opportunity, but I do not have the jurisdiction to move the troops beyond the mission I was assigned.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prince let out a murmur of disappointment as he wonder if he would have to miss such a grand opportunity.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried spoke up as if he had read the prince’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“However, Your Highness, there is a way for me to help you that is within my discretion.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hoh, and what may that be?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The order I received from the mainland was to protect your domain, wherever that may be. To that end, I and the troops of the Republic will spread a foolproof defensive line around the Northern region. In that time…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I could lead our elite Northern corps of 30,000 and attack the Capital.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is precisely my point.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Second Prince smiled brightly, for this was definitely an enticing offer. Siegfried continued advocating for an offensive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In general, one must know when to distribute their strength in war among offense and defense. We Republicans will do our utmost to protect your territory. During that time, if you were to bring the valiant elite corps of the North and capture the Lester Kingdom’s Capital…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That does seem like a brilliant suggestion.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Second Prince was not familiar with the basics of warfare, but for some reason, he felt confident with Siegfried encouraging him. All he had to do was capture the Capital with the elite troops while the Republic watched over the Northern lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This chance will pass if I don’t decide quickly.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Steeling himself, the prince stood up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We will mobilize the army at once. Call for Marquis Marius!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Second Prince resolved to attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">***</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;gathered his advisors and informed them of his intentions to advance on the Capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Consequently, the Republic will be entrusted with defending, and we will be attacking the Capital with all troops.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first one to react was his maternal uncle Marquis Marius.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness, is this truly your own opinion?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed it is. A strange thing to ask.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prince sounded somewhat perturbed by the Marquis’s query. However, the Marquis could not shake his feeling of discontent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Did that snake say something strange to him?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt that the prince was becoming too dependent on the Republic. Though Marquis Marius initially consented to join hands with the Hildes Republic, he didn't completely trust them. So how could he agree to clearing out their home and leaving its protection to the Republican army?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This did not sit well with him – and he wasn’t the only one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness, with all due respect, I believe the first priority is solidifying our grip on the North.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I agree, Your Highness. Though the Republic claims they will protect our lands, I am of the opinion that they cannot be completely trusted.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other Northern nobles aligned with Marquis Marius. For these nobles, their lands had been passed down to them from their ancestors through the generations, and they couldn't help but be anxious at the idea of entrusting them to the Republic for even a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prince spoke as if he anticipated their objections.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am well aware of what it is that concerns you. But don't worry, for I would not entrust our base to the Republican forces without a safety measure.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He whipped out a single document.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This document formalizes my engagement to Roxanne – the eldest daughter of the Hildes Republic’s Fuhrer Bahasten.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles were beyond shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you intend to form an alliance of blood with the Republic, sir?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no way they wouldn't be surprised by this. No one anticipated the prince would go beyond a mere alliance with the Republic, and form a tie of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“There is nothing to be surprised about. Our need for the Republic’s aid is too pressing. To gain their aid, we too must&nbsp;</span><span>evince</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;that we are to be trusted.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And to that end, he was paying the price of creating a bond thicker than ink. The gravity of a blood tie was different from that of a simple alliance.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing this, the Northern nobles began to have their conviction shaken.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s not wrong. The Capital’s as good as empty right now…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Who knows when the next opportunity will come if we miss this one.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Solidifying our grip on the North would be close to calling it quits with what we already have. But what if we were to capture the Capital…?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anxiety faded, and in its place crept in greed. The prince repeated himself firmly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There will be no next time. If there are no more objections, I will assume that it is decided we will attack the Capital.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, the elite Northern company of 30,000 were slated to attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Would this really be alright?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Marius was still strongly unsettled.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was certain that this was a good opportunity to attack the Capital with the elite corps. There was no one left to stop them, now that their force of 80,000 had been defeated.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But entrusting their lands of the North to the Republic was ever a disturbing prospect. Unable to take it any further, Marquis Marius sought out Siegfried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, Marquis Marius. Why are you suddenly looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Marius scowled at Siegfried’s carefree attitude.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is something I wish to ask.”</span></p>
