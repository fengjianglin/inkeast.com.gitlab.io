 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton shared the information he had gotten from Kerber with Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you’re telling me that… Strabus Kingdom sent a large number of troops only to capture one man?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila couldn’t believe this. But Duke Palan, who had been next to Princess Leila, spoke up with a serious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This may all be true, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that I think about it, didn’t you say you confronted this man, Siegfried, yourself, Duke Palan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Palan took a moment to reorganize his thoughts before continuing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“After confronting him, Your Highness, I felt that Siegfried wasn’t a normal commander.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In what way wasn’t he normal?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness, your orders for that battle was for me to stop the enemy’s invasion.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. And didn’t you faithfully carry out that order, Duke Palan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… To be honest, I was a bit greedy, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You were greedy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Highness. When the enemy was right in front of my eyes, I couldn’t help but want to soundly defeat them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Palan thought that if he could overwhelmingly defeat the invaders in the battle, he would continue to move north and drive out the Republican army from Lester Kingdom’s Northern region. But, he wasn’t able to do so because Duke Palan realized that the enemy wasn’t someone who was easy to defeat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whatever methods I tried to use, I couldn’t get through his defense. And although I tried to break through by directly leading the troops…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You mean, you failed?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We suffered heavy losses, Your Highness. Once I took a step back and looked at it again, I realized that not only was he counterattacking every single one of my attacks, but he was also wearing my own troops down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It felt as though I was playing chess with a chess-master who was far better than I was. Whatever I did, nothing seemed to work. So in the end, I could only focus on defense.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila’s face turned serious as she listened to Duke Palan’s explanations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Siegfried didn’t have a lot of troops, and even with you, a Master, you couldn’t gain the upper hand? Is that what you’re telling me, Duke Palan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If there was a Master in that army, then I would not be alive right now, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Palan’s words were the best compliment that could be given to an enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Siegfried… Alright. Fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton gave a small sigh as he saw Princess Leila’s slight smile as she thought things through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The only reason this she-devil of a princess is reacting like that is because she thought up something evil… No, she came up with a great idea.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton planned to leave all the small details to her now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Duke Derek Brans was being treated with great hospitality in the Lester Kingdom, a part of him felt very uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re dragging things out too long.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans hadn’t come this far to a distant country, leading a large army of 50,000 men, to enjoy a banquet. His purpose in coming here was to fight and eject the Republican forces that were currently stationed in the northern part of Lester Kingdom in order to stop them from moving further down south. His second purpose was to kill Siegfried, the man who was considered to be the most dangerous person. Of course, Strabus Kingdom planned to strong-arm the Lester Kingdom during the negotiations and demand they get paid, but that wasn’t a part of Duke Bran’s role. His role was to lead the army into war, and defeat the Republicans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the problem was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was in a foreign country and needed the cooperation of the Lester Kingdom if he wanted to wage a justified war. Of course, the Strabus Kingdom had an edict from the royal family of the Lester Kingdom requesting reinforcement. But, the First Prince who had issued the official document had committed suicide just before they had arrived. In such a situation, Duke Bran couldn’t trust a single sheet of paper and move his army willy-nilly to fight against the Republicans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had to obtain an official declaration of cooperation from the Lester Kingdom but…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The problem was that Princess Leila, the current regent of this country, wouldn’t give him a clear answer, let alone have an official meeting with him. Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span>&nbsp;was frustrated thinking he would have to continue wasting time like this. And so, he decided he would meet with Princess Leila, whatever it took. In negotiations, the person who started first would generally lose more. However, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;could no longer meaninglessly waste time like this and decided to make the first move. But then, one of the Lester Kingdom’s assigned palace attendants came looking for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, a guest has come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A guest? Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;furrowed his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In this small country’s nobles ranking, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span>&nbsp;was considered a noble above all nobles, either by status or by skill. And for that reason, the Lester Kingdom’s nobles had impatiently lined up to meet with him. But to Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, those nobles had been no different from an annoying fly buzzing around his head. But this time, it was different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s Claudia, the wife of His Highness Skyt von Lester.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I’ll meet with her.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This wasn’t someone he could reject. The First Prince’s wife had been the one to give Strabus Kingdom the justification to step foot into Lester Kingdom. Since that’s the case, she would most likely be helpful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Yes, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon, the attendant appeared with a woman. The beautiful woman was dressed in a black robe with a veil covering her face. She gracefully greeted him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Claudia Lester.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans calmly responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Duke Derek Brans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Once the two sat face to face, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard about what recently happened. Please accept my sincerest condolences.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… Thank you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As though she could barely speak, Claudia’s voice was weak and trembling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the outside, she looked like a pitiful widow who was pretending to be strong even though her husband’s death had shattered her. Who would look at her and think that she had personally poisoned her husband?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why did you come to see me, My Lady?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I came to uphold my husband’s will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With those words, Claudia began to explain her situation…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The deceased First Prince had originally requested reinforcements from the Strabus Kingdom in order to defeat the Republicans who had taken over a region of Lester Kingdom, but ultimately fell into depression and had committed suicide. So, she, as his widow, would help Strabus Kingdom win the war against them in order to fulfill her husband’s will.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is… the only thing I can do to atone for not preventing my husband’s death.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans nodded as Claudia spoke through her tears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. I can understand your intent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans believed Claudia’s desperate appeal was reasonable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She must have loved her husband a lot.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>But Claudia was internally making fun of Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;for falling for her acting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Doesn’t matter whether they’re royalty or a Master, all men are the same.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whatever a beautiful woman says in tears will be taken as the truth. Claudia knew this very well from experience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It’d be foolproof if I whispered in his ear while we were in bed… but that’d be too much right now.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Claudia was a bit regretful that she was currently known as a widow. But that was okay. She had already prepared something that would help convince Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“It’s a bit humble, but I hope this would be useful to you, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Claudia handed over a sheet of&nbsp;</span><span>document</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to him. Duke Brans looked at her in shock once he saw it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lady, where did you get this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would this be of help?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;gave her a bright smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s definitely helpful. I feel so relieved that it feels like an aching tooth is gone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was delighted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m glad it’ll be of use.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Truly, thank you. If there is anything that I could do to help you, please do not hesitate to tell me, My Lady.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mentally, Claudia gave herself a wicked smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’ve been waiting for those words.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She pondered for a bit before speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This might be a difficult request but… may I ask?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, please speak.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, to be honest…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing Claudia’s request, Duke Brans nodded and admired her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really loved your husband.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He was my other half… no, he was my everything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand. I’ll accept your request, My Lady.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Claudia smiled at him from behind her veil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘Nice. That’s half done now.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;created a moment for him to meet with Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry for asking you to meet with me so suddenly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“No, it’s alright, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two perfunctorily greeted each other before Duke Brans got straight to the point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess Leila, as you know, we came to this country to annihilate the vicious Republicans that’s currently occupying the Northern part of your country.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Yes, and thank you for that. Unfortunately, my brother, the one who requested reinforcements, has died, and my father, the current king, is&nbsp;</span><span>deeply</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;ill that even I, his daughter, cannot see him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila sighed as though it was regretful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Although I am temporarily in charge of the country’s affairs, it is only temporary and informal. My authority cannot allow you to wage war in our country, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the very reason why Princess Leila still hadn’t given Duke Brans the permission he needed for the war. Unable to find a single gap in that logic, Duke Brans hadn’t been able to convince her and just had to accept that decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>But, things&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;different now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no need for you to worry, Princess Leila. As you can see here, I have the handwritten document written by His Majesty himself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;handed her the sheet of paper. It was officially recognizing the reinforcements from Strabus Kingdom and wholeheartedly agreeing to the cooperation between the two of them in this war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where did you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Although he might not want to see his daughter, your king seems to have met with his daughter-in-law.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her expression hardened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘That she-devil.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila had kept a constant surveillance over Claudia. But, Claudia seemed to have taken advantage of a gap and secretly came up with this plan. Fortunately, Princess Leila had already prepared for something like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although it wasn’t an edict written by the king, she couldn't continue to stop Strabus Kingdom. &nbsp;It would also be unreasonable to ask the Strabus Kingdom’s troops that had been mobilized and sent to Lester Kingdom to return back to their own country. In that case, there was only one method left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘If it’s something I can’t avoid, let’s just meet it head on.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Keeping her posture straight, Princess Leila spoke to Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since the king has commanded, I will do my best to cooperate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um, and I express my gratitude to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;looked a bit confused when Princess Leila easily agreed to cooperate with him. &nbsp;But, he immediately refocused and said, “Speaking of cooperation, a member of the royal family expressed their intention to join my military and participate in the war. Would that be alright with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At that moment, Princess Leila knew exactly who Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was talking about. Usually, people might think it would be the Third or Fourth Princes, whose presence in the court was low, who threw themselves into the battlefield hoping to gain some achievements, but…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t my brother’s wife a very courageous person?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">More like reckless</span><span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;and audacious</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Princess Leila’s words struck home. Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had used the phrase, “a member of the royal family,” but Princess Leila had instantly figured out it was Claudia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, she expressed her intentions to join the battlefield in order to fulfill her deceased husband’s will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>This had been Claudia’s request to Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. In order to personally fulfill her husband’s last will, Claudia asked the Duke to allow her to follow him to war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’m positive that she just wants to leave because she’s uncomfortable staying in the Capital when I’ve taken control of the court.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Right now, the opponent Claudia was most reluctant to deal with was Princess Leila. This wasn’t because Claudia was the widow of the First Prince who had been Princess Leila’s competition. Rather, there was history between Princess Leila and Claudia. Although she didn’t have any conclusive evidence, Princess Leila was convinced Claudia had been deeply involved with the death of her mother and brother.&nbsp;</span></p>
