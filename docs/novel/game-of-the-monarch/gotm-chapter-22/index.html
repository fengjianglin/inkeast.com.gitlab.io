 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There’s no place better than home. Even if you’re not a homebody, you’d all have this feeling if you haven’t been home for a long while - one where your heart and mind is calmed and relieved. It was the same for Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congratulations on your victory, My&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Congratulations, Sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Returning to Forrest Manor, Milton was greeted by Administrator Thomas and Knight-Captain Sansen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll hear your reports tomorrow. I want to rest right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton just received their welcome and pushed off hearing their reports till the next day. But before that, he introduced the new people he had brought with him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is Jerome Taker, a Knight I brought back with me from the war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Jerome Taker, pleased to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome to House Forrest, Sir Jerome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As though he had instantly recognized Jerome’s prowess, Sansen was very polite.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once he had introduced the men he had brought with him, Milton pushed off everything till the next day and dove into his bed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haa…. This is life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Closing his eyes, Milton felt himself sinking into his bed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘There’s really no place like home.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were a lot of things that needed to be done, but right now, he just wanted to rest. Once he had his day of rest, Milton would tackle the workload.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it morning?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Waking up in his own bedroom, Milton ate breakfast and immediately called for his vassals. First, he had to get a report of what had occurred during his absence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton read the report Thomas had previously prepared in the library.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Not bad, not bad at all.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Manor’s situation was better than when he had left. &nbsp;Thanks to Milton’s participation in the war with Strabus Kingdom, they were exempted from taxes this year and the output of the estate had increased considerably. Once he finished reading the report, Milton had a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Administrator Thomas.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Patting Thomas’s nervous shoulders, Milton praised him, “Well done. You’ve worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Milton’s praise, Thomas had a delighted expression on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I thought it would be great if we could just maintain the output, but it increased compared to previous years. Do you have any secret tricks?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thomas replied with an ecstatic expression, “To be honest, My Lord, my son did all that. Since he was originally a farmer, he truly understands what needs to be done for the best outcome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thomas credited his son Max for managing the estate well and to be honest, Milton had already expected that. Max’s farming was at level 6. Milton had assumed this would happen once he had Max assist Thomas. This wasn’t the only thing Milton wanted Max to realize.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Let’s see. Mm, it hasn’t even been a year and he’s already gotten stronger.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had glanced at Max’s stats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Max]</span></p>
 <p>Administrator LV.3</p>
 <p>Strength – 17 Command – 35</p>
 <p>Intellect – 72 Politics – 77</p>
 <p>Loyalty – 65</p>
 <p>Special Trait – Improvisation, Agriculture.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Improvisation LV. 4: React to unforeseen circumstances with the best possible method.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Agriculture LV. 6: A deep understanding of farming. Increases the amount of produce harvested from farmland. Reduce the effects of drought and flooding to a minimum.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max's level as an administrator had gone up a whole level, and his overall abilities had also improved. Although the low level of loyalty was a bit concerning, Milton was happy with the rest of Max’s stats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On his way home, Milton had heard there was less harvest compared to previous years in other fiefs. But seeing how his own fief’s harvest had increased in comparison, it was obvious how useful Max and his specialty trait of agriculture was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Compared to him…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton glanced at Thomas’s stats.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Thomas]</span></p>
 <p>Administrator LV.6</p>
 <p>Strength – 08 Command – 30</p>
 <p>Intellect – 45 Politics – 50</p>
 <p>Loyalty – 89</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Special Trait <span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; float: none; display: inline !important">–</span> Caution</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Caution LV 5: Reduces mistakes in getting things done. Gets things done carefully when doing something used to, but takes a while to get used to doing new things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thomas’s stats had fallen instead of rising. It was the first time Milton had seen such an instance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘So stats can also fall. Well, I guess that’s only natural since as you get older, your body and mind abilities can get lower. A shift in generation is definitely necessary.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This is what Milton had expected when he had made Max an assistant. He knew Thomas’s retirement wasn’t far off, so he wanted to make the transition as smooth as possible and have Max inherit the position. But first, Thomas had to retire. With that decision, Milton spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Administrator Thomas, how old are you now?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m 62 this year, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If this was in Korea, Thomas's time for retirement had long passed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Resolute, Milton addressed Thomas. “ Thomas, as of this moment, you are no longer the Administrator.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having been laid off, Thomas was shocked and Max’s face showed his displeasure. From his point of view, Thomas was fired after having devoted his entire life to the fief, so it was only natural for him to be upset.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Huh, the already low loyalty, fell even further.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton saw Max’s loyalty falling from 65 to 60.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But one should listen to a person till the very end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Patting Thomas’s shoulder, Milton consoled him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From now on, you’re not going to be the Administrator. Instead, you’re going to be an Elder of the fief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Elder… My Lord, what does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is a new position I’ve created to honor those like you who have devoted their entire lives to the fief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Thomas’s confused expression, Milton continued on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ll step back from the day-to-day workload, and instead, your son Max will take over as your replacement.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Up to here, it was an ordinary retirement, but Milton wasn’t done.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And even though you have retired, you’ll continue to receive what you’ve been earning as a pension. During your retirement, you’ll give advice when necessary. That is the position of an elder.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, Milton was telling Thomas to retire and rest while receiving a pension.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thomas was overwhelmed with gratitude. In this world, they worked until they couldn’t, and there was no such thing as a pension for the retirees. But for Milton to treat Thomas like this when he hadn’t even been very competent…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Due to Milton’s thoughtfulness, Thomas couldn’t help but shed tears of emotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Milton glanced at Max, ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Do you understand now?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max was very surprised by Milton’s actions, which by the standards of this world was very unconventional.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Patting Max’s shoulders, Milton said, “Max, as of this moment, you are the Administrator of this fief. Do you accept the position?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a ninety degree bow, Max replied, “I gladly accept it, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Milton rechecked Max’s stats, the loyalty trait that had fallen to 60 had risen to 72.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Tch, should’ve trusted me, buddy.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was satisfied as Max’s loyalty level, which rarely rose, exceeded 70 for the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as a new Administrator was decided upon, Milton looked at Sansen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sansen, as you may have just heard, I hope you will also retire and support this fief as an elder from behind the scene.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his words, Sansen shook his head. “My Lord, if you tell me to relinquish the Knight Captain title, I will. But I feel it’s too early for me to retire.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike Thomas, Sansen wasn’t happy with retirement. It wasn’t a problem of money or treatment, but because his loyalty dictated he dedicate his life to the fief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s a stubborn one.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at him, Milton was reminded of Nelson on the Western Front. But if he wanted to have Jerome as the Knight-Captain, Sansen would become a hindrance. Even if Jerome did become the Knight-Captain, it would be difficult to ignore Sansen with his many years of experience on the fief. &nbsp;Since Jerome wasn’t one who’d willingly let go of his authority, there was the possibility where there might be two Knight Captains. And because of that, Milton had to get Sansen to retire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even though you would both be elders, I have something else in mind for you. For that to occur, I need you to step back and retire.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it that you need me to do, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am hoping that the twenty mercenaries who went to war with me will be willing to settle in our fief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s right. When the mercenaries saw Milton’s leadership on the Western Front, some thought it wouldn’t be bad to live under his rule. They couldn’t live their entire lives as a mercenary, and it was common for them to find a job as a soldier for a fief. However, Milton wanted to recruit and train them to become Knights, and the mercenaries knew this was an uncommon opportunity. &nbsp;Understanding this to be an opportune opportunity, the mercenaries joined Milton’s household.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have no complaints about their skills and abilities, but because they lived as mercenaries, they’re a bit rough in attitude. I want to take them in and train them as Knights but their behavior and composure is a bit…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And you want me to train them, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re the ideal person. Who else has lived as a Knight their entire lives like you have?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once Milton convinced Sansen there was no one else but him, Sansen agreed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you wish, My Lord. I’ll take this task as my last mission in life and do my utmost best.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so, Thomas and Sansen’s retirements were handled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having dealt with the most difficult personnel problems, all that was left was easy. It was easy to have Jerome become the Knight Captain. Rick and Tom, not to mention the Knight Trainees, all accepted him as the Knight Captain easily. As for all the soldiers who had participated in the war, they were exempted from taxes for two years and given generous compensation. And for the families of soldiers who were killed in the war, they were given double the compensation as comfort money and ten years of tax exemption. Administrator Max felt that such compensation was unprecedented and tried to stop Milton. But Milton held different thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It’s best to give generous compensation; giving too little is worse than giving none.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And because of such thoughts, Milton received unplanned profits. For doing something unprecedented, Milton’s vassals were filled with gratitude.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The young Lord sure is amazing, isn’t he?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I agree! Who else would give compensation for dying on the field?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Although the previous Viscount wasn’t bad… but this young lord is even better. Maybe it’s because he’s younger.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Amongst the vassals, Milton’s popularity skyrocketed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time, a new message popped up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[The public sentiments of your vassals have been raised to the maximum. All traits have risen by one level.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[A new trait ‘Clout’ has been added.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh ho… this is an unexpected windfall.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton opened the stats window and checked for himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Charisma LV. 3: Able to use the carrot and stick appropriately to raise the loyalty of subordinates.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Awaken LV. 2: Awaken servants, increasing their abilities through psychological means, and raising their loyalty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clout LV. 1: Able to raise public sentiment of oneself through issuing rewards or giving rousing orations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was nice to see the level of Charisma and Awakening raised, but the new trait of Clout was also quite good. In recent years, the Republicans had been secretly inciting the people. So, for the stability of the territory, the Clout skill that could control the people’s sentiments was useful. While his abilities had leveled up and the newly recruited people had settled in, Milton still had something important left to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
