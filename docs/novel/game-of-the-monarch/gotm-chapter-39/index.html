 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bullies’ true level was obvious to Trike. No matter how much Trike specialized in archery, he was confident he could stomp any number of these chumps.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he was still a mercenary, he would already have jumped into the fray and simply fled to another country. Now that he was a knight, he had no choice but to hold it all in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three briskly chose suitable uniforms and went to purchase them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That will be 6 gold altogether.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pardon?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick was astonished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">2 gold a piece. He had no idea that knight apparel was so expensive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though Milton had certainly given them enough funds, to Rick – who had lived modestly within his means all his life – paying for a single piece of clothing at this price made him tremble.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Isn’t this almost as much as armor? What sort of cloth could possibly…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unable to wrap his head around the price, Rick asked the salesclerk doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this price correct? A little expensive, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he said this…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Puahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knights who were watching the situation unfold roared with laughter, as if they were watching a jester play a joke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Expensive? Puaha… a uniform that’s barely two gold is expensive?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m laughing so hard it hurts…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it a specialty of the Southern knights to kill their enemies with laughter?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick turned beetroot red as they continued to deride him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The salesclerk assured Rick in a down-to-business tone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir, the prices of all our garments here are set beforehand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. I’ll buy this one.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick did not want to stay here any longer. He only desired to get what he came for and get out, fast.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Regardless, the capital knights continued their mockery of him from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you sure you can afford that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m telling you in advance, but we don’t accept bread or porkchops as payment like you do back home.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick purchased the clothes hurriedly, and the three of them made their way to the exit of this unpleasant space.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the capital knights closed off their path, standing in front of Rick.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nah, it’s nothing – I’m just really curious about something. May I ask just one question?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not wish to answer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick tried to turn them down and pass by, but the bullies blocked the store door and refused to step aside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Move.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick firmly demanded, but they simply grinned and did not budge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rather…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No no, you just need to answer my question.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Didn’t I say to move?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll move as soon as you answer the question. Or you can scuttle off through my legs, if you want.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Something snapped inside Rick, and he felt a fiery rage he had never felt in his entire life. But along with that rage was also deep disappointment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘These guys are knights? These guys are the capital’s knights that have received a complete education at an Academy?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick was a knight who hailed from a commoner background, but Sansen had drilled him since he was a boy to never tarnish the knight’s code.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Valor, sincerity, honor, etiquette, modesty, protecting the weak, and so on…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The seasoned knight that was Sansen scrupulously focused on pruning his successors’ dignity and cast of mind just as much as their skills on the battlefield. Rick came to assume that all knights of this world were expected to behave that way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So what was this?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their behavior was no different than some local drunkards picking a fight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could not believe that such individuals were called knights in the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Move. If you don’t…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick was about to explode, but…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rick.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, he was held back by Tommy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tommy, how could you not even be mad?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick was about to vent, but Tommy stayed in front of Rick with a stern expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you forget why we’ve come here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Remembering their objective, Rick shut his eyes tightly. He himself could not care less about being punished for causing public disorder – but they could not afford to ruin their liege’s ascension ceremony.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick displayed the most patience he had ever mustered in his life, while Rick faced them instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not know what your question is, but things are starting to turn unpleasant so please move.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The instigator snorted and responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“It’s nothing, just that I heard an unbelievable rumor going around. Oh!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">I&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">don’t believe it, for one. I don’t, but… I can’t help but think it may be the truth seeing how you folks behave.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your opening is too long. Get to the point please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmm, then if I were to say it straight, you blokes wouldn’t come from a commoner background, would you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…and if we were?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Tommy’s answer, his opponent caused a scene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By golly! It was true?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fair enough that you didn’t go to an Academy, but common fish becoming a knight?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Unbelievable. What sort of unruly devildom is the South?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Trike ground their teeth as they were ridiculed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘These little shits really want to get some…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Should I whoop them?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the two’s rage began to manifest into a murderous aura, Tommy spoke firmly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that we’ve answered your question, please move.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph… alright. Buzz off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Looks like I can’t come to this shop anymore – I can’t be frequenting the same place as some commoner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They continued to mock the three of them even as they stepped aside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the trio were already one foot out the door, however, one of them finally crossed the line.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They said the Forrest lordship, right? Figures that their liege is a f**king retard. Knighting a commoner is… KUH!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">POW!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t get to finish, as a fist struck explosively into his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, the one who swung wasn’t the short-tempered Rick, or Trike with his mercenary background.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How dare you insult our lord? You are wishing for your deaths!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ever patient and cautious Tommy was the first to swing. The wrath he was exuding was night and day compared to his usual self – and he had more left in the tank where that came from.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do these Southern bumpkins think they’re doing?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you not know your place?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll teach you some manners.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The capital knights rushed at Tommy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whatever, screw it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“F**k, it’ll work itself out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Trike joined Tommy, realizing that they had come too far already.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Die, you bastards!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Say your prayers!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And that was how the brawl happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am sincerely sorry, my lord. I will accept any punishment that you see fit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Finishing his recount, Tommy bowed his head again and apologized.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord, try as Tommy may to suppress his anger, the scoundrels insulted your good name…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With all due respect, my lord, we did not have much choice at that point. I implore you to forgive Sir Croix.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Trike sided with Tommy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton finally spoke with a heavy expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll only ask you one thing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Surely you didn’t lose, did you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three’s faces lit up at Milton’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was 5 on 3, but we still wiped the floor with them.” Rick answered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then there will be no punishments. You’re free to come out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three of them fought to protect their liege’s honor as knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then how could he scold them as their sovereign?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Of course I’ll forgive them.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was not perturbed in the slightest. In fact, he was positively bubbling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He gladly paid the bail and returned together with his knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You foolish little things! Is that why all of you are in this sorry state?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One man who looked to be in his later years was thundering at the knights in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In truth, these men were a little too unsightly to be called knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their faces were bruised black and blue, and they were wrapped with bandages all around their body; presumably to caress broken bones. All around, they were battered quite badly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These men were the knights that Tommy and his company had wiped the floor with at the boutique just a moment ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The name of the man before them, moustache trembling with anger, was Kevin Librador.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was a noble with the peerage of Count and hailed from one of the typical well-established Houses of the capital, himself working with the Central Administrative Office.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His pride was strong, and he hated being looked down on by others as he had a strong sense of self-authority.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He believed that nobles were rightfully of a different class to commoners; and that even out of the nobles, the ones involved in bureaucracy at the Capital were cut from a different cloth. He was so proud of his identity that he categorized nobles further like such.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And today, that pride was greatly wounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His knights had been one-sidedly assaulted. Technically, it was not an assault but a brawl. In fact, Count Librador’s knights outnumbered them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But his knights had been so completely rendered into a wretched state, that there was no other word for it but an assault.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His knights had been so severely injured that they needed half an year at the minimum to rehabilitate – yet their opponents were completely fine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To a noble, his knights were a symbol and measuring yardstick of his strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the news got out that knights under his command were completely pummeled by another noble’s knights, it was obvious that he would become a target of ridicule.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What angered Count Librador even more was that their opponents served a hillbilly noble that he had never heard of before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where did you say they are affiliated with?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Fo-Forrest lordship.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you saying you lost to some damn bumpkins from the deep South? And when you outnumbered them at that?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knights only fidgeted without objection at his chiding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘To think they would be this strong…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Damn it, they were a bunch of hillbillies that’ve never stepped foot inside an Academy…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘How humiliating is this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They did not understand that all Academies were not built equal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The standards for a Knight Academy in a peaceful nation such as the Lester Kingdom were as expected. The staff themselves were not particularly capable, while the students were, indeed, not as engaged in the teaching. It would not be a tall tale to say that the current rendition of Academy-trained knights from the Lester Kingdom were noble children that entered the school simply as a matter of formality, and obtained their graduation certificate after filling the necessary time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, Rick and Tommy were rigorously trained by the scrupulous Sansen since childhood, after which they followed Milton to the Strabus Kingdom to partake in a war. And there was not much to be said about Trike, who had worked as a mercenary and was involved in real combat for an extensive amount of time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three’s past experiences put them on a different level to these flowers that had grown inside a greenhouse. The capital knights could not acknowledge it, but they were assured to lose a hundred fights if they fought a hundred times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Librador could not acknowledge this fact either.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a matter of pride that a bureaucratic noble from the Royal Capital such as himself, that had real sway in the country’s affairs, would be beat by a no-name noble from some corner of the South.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Forrest lordship, huh… I do not know who you are, but I shall make you regret crossing my path.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Librador decided to find out what sort of person the noble of the Forrest lordship was at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were some hiccups, but Milton stayed faithful to his original objective in coming here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">First, he applied for entrance into the Royal Palace and waited until he was allocated his date and time, which took as long as four days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon enough, Milton and his knights were sitting in the waiting room of the royal office for their turn at an audience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Meanwhile, Trike asked Milton a question that revealed his boredom with the whole process.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is the procedure for entering the Royal Palace normally this complicated?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, that depends on the noble requesting entrance. I presume that the more influential nobles would skip over most of this complex process.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So sure enough, it’s because your position isn’t that high yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trike nodded as if in understanding and Milton sighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Could you not express things a bit more delicately?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What can I do about how I’ve always spoken? Please just give it a pass.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“True…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had no intention of forcefully instilling a proper knight’s etiquette in Trike. His skills as an archer were too valuable to scorn him over such a trivial gripe. If someone’s competence was tried and true, he was flexible enough to pass over any number of small issues.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Still, try to be careful with your words in front of Jerome or Sansen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah… that mister… he really didn’t know when to give up. I told him that me and manners don’t mix so he should call it a day, but…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sansen is a dedicated one indeed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now an elder statesman of the Forrest lordship, Sansen was a straight-laced man who believed the character and etiquette of a knight, rather than their strength, was a reflection of their identity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These days, he was giving it all in disciplining Trike. It was as if he had taken it upon himself as his remaining life’s work to teach discipline and etiquette to this strong – but mannerless – knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Consequently, Trike squirmed anxiously whenever he so much as sensed Sansen approaching.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can’t you do something about him, my lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’m not sure he would even listen to me on this matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick and Tommy nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh… I don’t quite feel like returning to the estate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It soon became Milton’s turn while they were chatting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Viscount Milton Forrest, you may enter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Receiving the attendant’s directions, Milton rose to have his audience with the king of the land.</span></p>
