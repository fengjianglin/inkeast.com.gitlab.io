 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After forming a review of each other, the two began to let their guard down just a little. Viscount Sabian went down to business.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am sure you are aware, Princess, but the present situation is not looking very favorable for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You may just say it as it is – it’s a disaster. It is the truth, after all…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Princess Leila’s&nbsp;</span><span>sigh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;revealed her exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is all due to that monster of the Republic.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Truth be told, I too did not expect for the Republics to retain such a monster.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though Viscount Sabian did not join in the war effort in mourning for his late teacher, another reason was that he did not see a possibility of them losing this war. This appeared to be a war they would win anyway, with the emphasis instead being on how significant a role the Southern army played. Reaching this conclusion, Sabian turned down Milton’s offer to hold his master’s funeral.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He did not imagine in his wildest dreams that things would turn out this way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But there was no point in regretting the irreversible past. The important thing was the here and now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“First of all, we cannot summon Count Forrest back to the Capital. The reasons are exactly as you say, Princess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if the Capital remained standing with Milton’s help, the Lester Kingdom would be as good as finished if Siegfried was allowed to do as he pleased with the rest of the nation. What meaning would there be in protecting the Capital if the rest of the nation’s infrastructure was destroyed?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On top of that was the more substantial issue of the peoples’ sentiment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Public perception of the kingdom was already at an all-time low thanks to the civil war waged by the princes. The one royal that was a shining beacon of hope for the people was Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In this precarious situation, if Princess Leila neglected the peoples’ suffering and they turned away from her as well, it would be a cause for celebration in the Republic. A kingdom that had lost the faith of its people was ideal prey for spreading the ideology of Republicanism. Princess Leila was well aware of these facts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only, the issue was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you believe that Duke Palan will indeed be able to protect the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a substantial possibility that Duke Palan and 20,000 troops would not be enough to defend.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian drove the final nail in the coffin for the restless Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. He cannot protect it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila had expected as much for an answer, but hearing the actual words made her sigh instinctively.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is tough. Real tough.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Republican army that Siegfried commands has decimated Duke Brans and his 50,000 men with almost no losses. In all honesty, it would be safe to presume that the odds of Duke Palan protecting the Capital, even if he were to maximize the advantages of being on the defense, are close to zero.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then whatever shall we do? You would not have sought me when you plainly know all the facts without devising a counterplan, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila put the ball in Viscount Sabian’s court, who whipped out a map from his coat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the product of staying up two whole nights without sleep when he realized their predicament.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I shall explain. To begin with…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian pitched the strategy he had prepared in great detail. Whenever Princess Leila threw him a question on some aspect of his plan, he replied readily without a hitch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few hours later, the explanation concluded – and Princess Leila was awestruck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After listening to Viscount Sabian’s proposal, she felt as if she could see a faint ray of sunlight penetrating through a sky blanketed with dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are a genius.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for your appreciation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Viscount Sabian, by my name I authorize you with the full powers for this operation. Please emerge successful at all costs.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will give it my all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">By royal decree, all the citizens in the Lester Kingdom’s Capital were preparing for evacuation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness, what is the meaning of this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed, what has prompted Your Highness to suddenly evacuate the citizens?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The simmering nobles raised their qualms when they caught wind that Princess Leila issued an evacuation order to the common people. They could not possibly understand her actions from their angle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">How could she choose now to evacuate the citizens when the enemy could come crashing in at any moment?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In an evacuation, the royals and the nobles were meant to go first and they went without the citizens knowing. They had never heard of the common people being evacuated first, and at such a large scale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila retorted nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is no real method available to us for impeding the enemy’s advance. If that is the case, is fleeing not the only path remaining for us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, is it not the obvious course of action for the people to be left until last, and for the nation’s leadership to retreat first in confidence?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is nothing more important to a country than its people. I shall evacuate them foremost, and take all the responsibility I must as a royal by joining them on the path to refuge.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles were stunned as Princess Leila answered without a hint of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Is she out of her mind?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Does she have a hero complex?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Women…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To the nobles, Princess Leila appeared as an out-of-touch child who was acting out some biography of a heroic figure she read – no, more likely some fairytale she had become a little too obsessed with.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well then, Princess. If you have chosen escape, then would it be fine for us to likewise vacate the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Most certainly. If you all intend to join me and share in the hardships of the people, that is enough to receive my thanks.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No – we will be moving separately.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With all due respect, it seems I cannot take part in your actions, Princess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With the circumstances being what they were, the nobles became openly disrespectful towards the princess as they were determined to make it out of this alive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila frowned at them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Do you intend to abandon the people? Where have your mentalities of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">noblesse oblige&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">gone?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For there to be the country’s people, there must be the country. And if the country is to remain standing, the center that is her leadership must take precedence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is so. Rest assured, our decision has prioritized the future of this nation above all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila feigned an enraged expression and shot up from her seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Cowards,&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;lot of you men! Then disappear from my sight at once. I’ve got no desire to throw my lot in with ones who do not know honor!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles flinched at first, but they quickly met her gaze with wide open eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It will be you, Princess, that will regret being swayed by shallow emotions to make such a silly decision – not us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We are not so foolish as to stay on a sinking ship until the very end.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;They all spewed something along those lines as they left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once they returned to their estate, they would likely hurry to pack their belongings and seek asylum in foreign lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they all left the royal hall…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How wearisome. How many times have I repeated this song and dance since this morning?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian appeared from his eavesdropping spot to respond to Princess Leila’s grumbling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are doing well. We may as well take this opportunity to sort the good from the bad.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hoh. In the Southern continent, there exists a saying that one gains more every time he stumbles…. you are exactly that kind of character, Viscount.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I appreciate the praise.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That being so – how long must this act continue? I am under the impression that we are on a tight schedule, are we not?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At present, all the nobles of the Capital will be attempting to curry favor with you, Princess. I believe… half a day more should suffice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How tiresome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m afraid it must be done.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;“Very well. Then I suppose I will continue…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That day, just as Viscount Sabian advised, Princess Leila had an audience with the majority of the influential nobles in the Capital. The exchanges were akin to the one held at the royal hall, with the nobles having two different final reactions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Somewhere within the realm of 80 percent of the nobles criticized, or in worse cases were infuriated, by Princess Leila’s actions. For the ones that seethed with rage, the only reason that they did not commit treason there and then was because Duke Palan remained on standby where they could plainly see.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, the remaining 20 percent of the nobles joined Princess Leila. Some of these held dear their honor as nobles and had a proper moral compass. Others were fascinated or impressed by the capability and charisma that Princess Leila displayed in the short time she had been managing state affairs as a stand-in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Others still were yet wary and unsure, deciding to follow Princess Leila with the vague notion that she still held the reins of power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reasons were many, but the fact was that 20 percent decided to remain loyal to Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila and these nobles together aided in preparing the evacuation of the citizens from the Capital. Meanwhile, the other 80 percent hurriedly packed their assets and fled as fast as possible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Among these nobles that were fleeing was the present king, King August. King August, who had secluded himself until now with the excuse of having fallen ill, departed from the Capital with the nobles still loyal to him. In the process of doing so, he took all the collective wealth of the royal family with him, scraping to the very bottom of the barrel. He, too, was likely intending to defect to other lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even as she became aware of this, Princess Leila did not stop him. She merely thought the whole procession was sad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘To think my father would only amount to this much…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She merely shook her head, for she did not have the luxury of time to gripe about it further. Now was the time for them to pick up the pace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">First, she sent a messenger to Milton to elaborate on their course of action.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Next, she publicly announced her intentions to accompany the people on their evacuation. The people were greatly encouraged by this statement while they prepared for the long and hard road to refuge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To think that the Princess would join us…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So it is true that the Princess stands with us, when even His Majesty the King is said to have fled?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As far as I’ve heard, she lambasted the nobles who abandoned us and bolted.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those rotten mongrels… so not only did they abandon us, are you saying that they also abandoned the blood royal that is the Princess?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn sons of bitches… they were always so far up their own asses, yet they make a run for it when the time of reckoning arrives.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Public sentiment became clearly distinguished. Towards King August and the nobles that had forsaken them that formed a large majority, the people harbored a strong sense of resentment. On the other hand, they became greatly faithful towards Princess Leila, who proclaimed she would join them and was supporting the evacuation effort from her own coffers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of Princess Leila’s specialties was spreading her men amongst the masses to manipulate popular sentiment – but this time around, there was no such need. Just by spouting the truth as it was, she achieved the results she wanted faster and more definitively than expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘That’s phase two of the plan completed. Onto the next right away.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, Princess Leila joined hundreds of thousands of civilians on the path of evacuation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was said that the procession of citizens that followed her stretched all the way to the horizon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After eliminating the Strabus Kingdom’s expedition army, Siegfried swiftly reconsolidated his troops and monitored the enemy’s movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He would have promptly attacked the Capital if this was anything like usual, but the existence of Milton’s Southern army weighed on his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Who would’ve thought that Captain Alfred would be so one-sidedly beaten?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just as the Lester Kingdom did not anticipate the Strabus army to be defeated, Siegfried did expect Alfred to be so unilaterally defeated either. For someone who was as cautious and meticulous as Alfred, it was presumed that he would be able to maintain the lines at the least, if not win outright.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The actual result was Milton’s landslide victory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Consequently, Siegfried prepared for the possibility of Milton and his army attacking them. But the Southern army stood unmoving and that attack never came.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was rather because Milton’s army stood still that Siegfried could not move promptly and was forced to steadily monitor the situation. It would spell trouble for them if the army of the South attacked them from the rear while they carried out their offensive on the Capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While Siegfried was stuck, the first one to make a move was Princess Leila who evacuated all the civilians from the Capital and joined them on their path to refuge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Siegfried received this news, he narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This has become rather bothersome.”</span></p>
