 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s true.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only reason Princess Leila was hesitating to ascend the throne was because of King August. When the Republicans had invaded, King August had taken his royal possession and fled abroad. But after that, there hadn’t been any news about him; he had disappeared without a trace. He hadn’t been captured by Siegfried nor had any other country said that King August sought asylum from them. Even now when the war was over, King August still hadn’t shown up. In other words, it wasn’t determined whether he was alive or dead. This was really bothersome for Princess Leila.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I was to ascend the throne when we’re still uncertain whether he’s alive or not, knowing my father, he’ll appear the moment I sit on the throne and claim that I was trying to usurp the throne.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if he did appear, I don’t think he’ll be a stumbling block for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not only did she have the public’s support, but she also had the support of the nobles and the military. There was no way King August could compete against her in any aspect. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He still has the legitimacy as the current king. With my father’s personality, he may even use the worst possible method available to him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Worst possible method, Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whining about it from another country. That terrible daughter of mine lacks filial piety and drove me out of my kingdom and became the monarch. So as friends, please help me. I will take back the throne and give you my kingdom in return.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila shrugged.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’ll be difficult if my father does this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would he really do that, Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, he’s capable of doing that and more.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton couldn’t disagree with her. If it happened as Princess Leila said, then it really would be terrible. They were just in the process of rebuilding their country after suffering a great deal of damages from the war, but if another war broke out again? At this point, if that really happened, then regardless of the outcome, their country would be toast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll keep an eye on the situation for at least a year. And it’ll be better to slowly ascend the throne as I am recognized by the neighboring countries.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright, I understand. Then I won’t mention it again, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you. To be honest, I think a wedding should take precedence over a coronation. Then, all the proposal letters that’s been swamping me would be gone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton sipped his tea while pretending not to understand as he thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Don’t be caught. Don’t be fooled. Don’t be tricked by her.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila had been subtly shoving the marriage card in front of Milton’s face for a while now. And it hadn’t even been a proper proposal, rather, more of a foregone conclusion: ‘We’re getting married, when should we do it?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be honest, for Milton, Princess Leila was a bit too much to marry. Like she had said, it would be difficult for him to find and marry a woman as beautiful as she was anywhere else in the world. But, was it possible to decide on a marriage partner just by appearance alone?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No, rather than that, how could he become the Queen’s husband? That would be a tiresome life. Even though the peaceful and luxurious silver spoon life that he had wanted at first was gone, Milton still thought life as Princess Leila’s husband would make his life even more difficult than it was now. And there was also another reason he was hesitating to marry her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, are you here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the space where it had been just the two of them, Sophia Philinover with her red hair and bright smile suddenly appeared. Sophia politely greeted Princess Leila as soon as she saw her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Greeting to Her Highness, the Princess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm, it’s nice to see you, Lady Philinover.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as she had greeted the Princess, Sophia immediately turned to Milton and stated her business.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I created a plan that would create jobs so that the immigrants could work on expanding the district. Would you read and sign it off?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton read her report while praising it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not bad. Providing jobs would reduce their dependence on rations. Is this what you thought, Sophia?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that’s right, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a good idea, proceed with it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton signed the report and returned it to her. Happy that her plan had been accepted, Sophia smiled at Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing her smile so brightly without a hint of self-interest, inadvertently, a thought crossed Milton’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She’s cute.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton unwittingly reached out and stroked Sophia’s head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a moment, Sophia was embarrassed, but she continued to stay still as Milton quietly stroked her hair. It seemed like she found it pleasant. Milton thought her red hair was very soft and pretty as he let them fall between his fingers. Just as he was stroking her hair in a daze…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Cough</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Marquis Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had forgotten that Princess Leila was next to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Milton quickly took back his hand but Princess Leila gave him a harsh look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if you have a lord and vassal relationship, that doesn’t give you the right to stroke the hair of a grown woman.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, you’re right. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rather than me, I think you should be apologizing to Lady Sophia?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m alright, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sophia cut him off. Then, she looked towards Princess Leila with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It may look somewhat unconventional from an outsider’s perspective, but it’s fine since it was between me and My Lord… this was fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re fine with it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Highness. I was rather happy. It feels like I have an older brother…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Sophia speak with a shy smile, Milton responded to her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m glad that you think so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, My Lord. Then, I’ll come back again next time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After Sophia had left, Princess Leila turned to look at Milton with an unhappy look on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Have you ever had skinship or other physical affection like this before with Lady Philinover?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t it too much to describe that as physical affection?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm… is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I just wanted to praise her and my hand naturally went to her head.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he didn’t tell her that he kept stroking Sophia’s head because it felt soft and pleasant to touch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine. If it’s just praising…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Saying that, Princess Leila suddenly changed topics.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that I think about it, wouldn’t you be able to create more jobs by vitalizing the port?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re talking about the port, Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. Since you built a port, you should open a route yourself rather than waiting for it to become active. Once there’s a route, merchants will flock to you and jobs will naturally increase.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s a good idea, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He hadn’t thought about it, but if he opened a sea route, then he could accelerate the territory’s development and create a large number of jobs for the refugees. But most importantly, creating a sea route meant that there was a line of funds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How is it? Would it be helpful?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila asked him coyly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, it’s very helpful. I have to talk with my retainers immediately.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Milton trying to leave, Princess Leila grabbed his sleeve.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…what’s wrong, Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um… I was helpful, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, you were, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since I was helpful… don’t I get anything?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila subtly tilted her head towards Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘No way? …does she really?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Princess Leila continued to tilt her head towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You said it was helpful…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, yes. That’s um…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You did so easily to someone else…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That all depends on who it is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton started making excuses, then just stopped and sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This vixen… Fine. I’m caught. I’m caught, okay.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just this once, Milton decided to be ‘caught’ by her and gently stretched out his hand and stroked her hair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a way, stroking the hair of a country’s princess was a rare and valuable experience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But more importantly, he wasn’t stroking the hair of any princess — not that he had seen any other princess before — but he was stroking the hair of Princess Leila. It tickled a corner of his heart that a provocative and exhausting woman like her was being coquettish in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although it occurred to him that this was another trap by the vixen to get him to marry her…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘Her hair is so soft and it smells good.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila’s golden blond hair flowing down between his fingers was very soft.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sea route development. This wasn’t as easy as it sounded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In this world, when you talked about sailing, you were basically talking about coastal sailing. It was a type of voyage where the ships didn’t sail far from the land and made multiple stops in the middle to resupply before arriving at the final destination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had originally planned for his port to be one of those intermediary stops for the ships, but now that he was trying to make his own sea route, he got a bit greedy. Milton knew exactly what the most important thing was in developing routes like this. It was a monopoly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t particularly want to discover a new continent or anything like that. But he did want to preemptively acquire and monopolize a route that other people hadn’t developed so far. So what Milton was aiming for was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I want to create a direct route to Waterport Kingdom.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Waterport Kingdom was an island country that was off the southern coast of the Central continent. Although the country itself wasn’t big, because it was an island country with fertile soil, it had a strong navy and was famous for producing excellent wine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was also ideally located between the Central and Southern continent. Waterport Kingdom benefited tremendously since it was able to trade between both continents. If Strabus Kingdom was the strongest military power after Andrews Empire, then Waterport Kingdom was the second richest country after Andrews Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, because the Waterport Kingdom was quite far from the Lester Kingdom, there was no direct trading between the two countries. That was why Milton believed that there would be a considerable amount of benefit if he was able to make a direct sea route between the two countries. But this wasn’t an easy task.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Milton finished talking, Max was the first one to oppose his plan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s difficult, My Lord. Our territory, no our country doesn’t have the necessary advanced navigational skill that would be needed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If it’s someone to navigate, then can't we just find a competent sailor?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, it’s not that simple. Even if we made an announcement, we don’t know how many people would even gather and there’s no way of finding out whether they really are competent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Logically, Max made sense, but…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Tsk, I can judge whether a person is competent or incompetent.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because Milton had a talent that was otherworldly, he wasn’t able to agree with Max on that aspect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And that’s not the only problem. Even if we were able to gather qualified crew members and open up a route, there’s another reason why it’s difficult to directly trade with Waterport, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the reason?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because of pirates, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pirates…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was a serious problem for Milton as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Geographically, Lester Kingdom was located in the middle of the continent,&nbsp;</span><span>no slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;above the center. When compared to the human body, it’s located above the waist, around the chest?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In comparison, the target destination, the Waterport Kingdom, was an island country far beyond the southernmost tip of the continent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was natural that pirates roamed the sea when it was so far away. Just as long-distance trades had great benefits when it succeeded, it also has a proportional amount of damages if pirates were to target their ship and steal from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please think it over, My Lord. Waterport Kingdom is too far away and dangerous. I think Florence Principality or Gloucester Kingdom would be better.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Max’s earnest counsel, Milton closed his eyes to think.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s not wrong.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Florence Principality was a nation that shared the southern border of the Lester Kingdom and located beyond Florence Principality was Gloucester Kingdom. If you traveled by land, you would have to cross borders twice and the journey would be rough and dangerous, but if you traveled by sea, the distance would be quickly shortened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Doing that might be enough for financial gain.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After thinking it through, Milton realized that Max was right. But even if he knew that it was the logical thing to do, he still felt a tiny bit of regret in his heart. He couldn’t let go of that regret when he knew that if he could just develop an exclusive trade route to Waterport Kingdom, then the profits would be outrageous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Milton remembered his former bosses from his previous life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘That’s right, he used to accept ridiculously difficult assignments and nagged at his underlings. And when the deadline would pass, he would blame us.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton remembered how he went drinking with his colleagues and talked shit about those old bastards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Tsk, I can’t fall to the same level as those bastards.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max wasn’t an incompetent person, nor was did have a low Loyalty stat towards Milton. For him to so desperately oppose Milton’s idea, that meant he was absolutely certain Milton’s plan was bad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Max, you’re right. I was too greedy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Milton gave up his regrets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Milton frankly admit that he was wrong, Max’s tragic expression disappeared and astonishment took its place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My… My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max never thought the words, ‘I was wrong’ would ever come out of Milton’s mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In this world, the authority held by Lords, especially high-ranking nobles, was different from the authority held by bosses in the 21st century. If they, the Lords, were wrong, they might indirectly correct their commands, but they would never frankly admit that they were wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So in that sense, what Milton had just done was very unconventional. He could be seen as someone who was kind and thoughtful, but he could also seem like someone who was weak and a pushover. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank… thank you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Max was touched by his words. Although he was a commoner by birth, Max was a person who had high self-esteem because was highly talented. He was deeply moved that someone as great as Marquis Milton Forrest had acknowledged him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, one of Milton’s special traits, ‘Monarch’s Dignity,’ had also played a part.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘His Loyalty increased again.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once the Loyalty stat rose above 90, he was basically Milton’s, but when Max’s Loyalty rose, Milton decided that this was the perfect time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Max, I give you full authority to deal with commerce and the development of a trade route with Gloucester Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll do my best, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Full of motivation, Max energetically responded to Milton before quickly leaving to start working.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing him like that, Milton smiled happily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘With that much motivation, of course you’ll do well.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’</span></p>
