 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried thought that Duke Palan’s forces would join the Southern Army to fight against the Second Prince’s army. Since this was a civil war, and the Second Prince was in the very center of it, he had thought they would concentrate their power there. But as if he had been waiting, Duke Palan greeted the Republican Army led by Siegfried. After a couple probing skirmishes, Siegfried had to give up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the army he had gathered to attack the capital were all elite soldiers, he still only had 5,000 men. Duke Palan wasn’t an easy opponent who could be defeated with a small number of troops. And so, Siegfried decided to step back and observe the situation first. If the Second Prince’s army defeated the Southern Army, or put up a good fight, then Duke Palan’s army might waver. However, the news came back with the Southern Army’s victory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not only were there few casualties, but they had also captured the Second Prince and his allies were dealt with. Now, the longer the confrontation got, the more they would be at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It can’t be helped. I guess this is as far as we can go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a small sigh, Siegfried decided to withdraw while quietly muttering two names.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Milton&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of the Southern Army and Princess Leila…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried smiled as he muttered the names of the two people who had burnt his plans to ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll remember them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The civil war was over. But even though it was over, it wasn’t a situation where they could be happy or joyous. The civil war had left behind a lot of gaping wounds on the Lester Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had devastated the country, and when the First Prince’s subjugation army was defeated, &nbsp;countless men, fathers and sons, had died.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>And because the Second Prince had brought&nbsp;</span><span>in Hildes</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Republic, the Northern region had naturally been taken over by them. They only had half the nation's power from before the civil war began. In just one year, the damages to the country were numerous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The people’s resentment soared into the sky and the current king August von Lester’s prestige and authority fell to the ground. But could it be considered the irony of time? The darker it became, the more dazzling some would become.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Milton Forrest. He led the Southern Army and saved the people of the capital just before it fell and had overwhelmingly defeated the Second Prince’s army, saving the country. In bars, the bards sang songs praising Milton, and on the streets, children swung wooden sticks shouting, ‘I am Count Forrest.’ As though saved by divinity, all the people praised that one name. Milton Forrest, the hero, was born.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While returning with the army, Princess Leila spoke to Milton inside her carriage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How do you feel?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“About what, Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Milton pretending not to understand, she smiled as if she thought it cute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Didn’t you become the hero of the country like I said you would? So, how do you feel about that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton scratched the back of his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My subordinates liked it more than me. And well, I don’t find it all that bad either.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While they had been returning to the capital, countless nobles had approached Milton, desperate to be noticed by him. Some presented him with expensive gifts, and others introduced their beautiful daughters. Not too long ago, there were more nobles who didn’t know him than those who did. But now, as the hero of the country, everyone paid attention to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It’s a very funny world.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton smiled at Princess Leila.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No matter how popular I become, I still won’t be as good as you, Your Highness. How much did you expand your influence?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila gave a dazzling smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Satisfactorily. It’s just as I expected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Milton had become the hero of the country, then Princess Leila had the most possibility of becoming the next monarch now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was known to the world that…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila had been the one to convince Count Milton Forrest, who had been living a life of integrity and loyalty to the country without being swayed by money or fame in the South, to save the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was rumored that Count Milton Forrest had admired Princess Leila’s dignity, wisdom, and beauty that he swore allegiance to her. And because of their encounter was what saved the country. And the finishing touch was Duke Palan’s declaration of support for Princess Leila.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Palan had been completely neutral between the First Prince and the Second Princes’ the battle for the throne, but now, he had made an official declaration recognizing Princess Leila as his liege. With both the guardian and hero of the country on her side, Princess Leila was the closest to the throne. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since the current king has lost the people’s trust, with a bit of pressure, it won’t take long to take over the throne.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila gave a bitter laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well… he might be my father, but he’s extremely greedy for power.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And on top of that, that fox in the capital’s bothersome. She’s not someone who’ll take defeat easily.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fox?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila stared at Milton for a minute then gave a small sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I guess you should know it as well, Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She tucked her hair behind her ears as she continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The First Prince’s wife, Claudia, she’s the daughter of Marquis Vamos. Have you heard of her before?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just the name…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once you get to the Capital, she’ll probably approach you, Count Forrest. It’s best to be careful. She’s not just any woman.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Listening to Princess Leila talk about her, Milton thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Could she be worse than you?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But telling her that directly was just asking for trouble, so Milton changed topics.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Capital is only a day away now. I want to comfortably relax under a roof now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;words, Princess Leila apologized.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry, but I think we might have to sleep out in the open a couple more days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lady? Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I want my father to realize.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Realize what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton understood her vague words only after hearing her next words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That his days are now over.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her face was wreathed in smiles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ceremony of Triumphant Return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As one of Lester Kingdom’s traditional ceremonies, it was the biggest one celebrating those who had returned after winning a major war. In all of Lester Kingdom’s history, it was a rare ceremony that had been held for only two people. All the citizens in the capital would come out with flowers to welcome them while all the nobles would dismount from their horses to greet them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>And the country’s king would&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;come down to the public square to help the returning hero stand on the platform, while he himself would look up at the hero to express his gratitude. It wasn’t the king praising his vassal for his service, but the king expressing his gratitude to his vassal. In other words, it was an event that could bruise the image of the kingship. One of the two heroes who had previously been awarded this ceremony had been a royal, so that was fine. And the other was also alright because the king thought of him as close as brothers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>But was the relationship between Milton and King August like that? Absolutely not. For King August, who was greedy for power, it was impossible to hold a Ceremony of Triumphant Return. Wouldn’t that just speed up the downfall of his fallen kingship? Of course he had no&nbsp;</span><span>intentions</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of holding it. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? You want me to hold the Ceremony of Triumphant Return?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though he didn’t have the intention to, the nobles argued that Milton Forrest’s achievements this time were worthy of one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Majesty, Count Forrest ended the civil war, defended the country, and stopped the invasion of the wicked Republic. In light of these achievements, it would be good to hold the Ceremony and raise public sentiment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty. If Your Majesty is willing to honor Count Forrest, the people will also rejoice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many of his subordinates insisted that the Ceremony be held. King August was stunned. Even if he himself didn’t want to, the nobles themselves all insisted that the Ceremony of Triumphant Return happen. This was evidence that his authority as a king had fallen to the floor. Extremely displeased, King August stood up from his seat and furiously yelled at the nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It wasn’t even a national disaster, he just ended the civil war!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was definitely a national disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And isn’t the North still in the Republican’s hands?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was King August’s son, Byron von Lester’s fault.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A Ceremony of Triumphant Return? No way, not happening. Count Forrest doesn’t have enough achievements for that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">King August made his decision and strode out of the palace. Some of the nobles who insisted on the Ceremony looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We did as ordered, but he really didn’t agree to it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But we still did as ordered, didn’t we?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s true. We did as we were ordered, so now we just have to observe the situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahh…as expected of my Father. He never fails to meet my expectations.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila smiled as she heard from the informants she had secretly planted in the capital. He was a man who had lived his whole life with power clenched in his fists.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Family, country, honor…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nothing could be worth more than power to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s why he ignored his children committing fratricide and was so cold even when the women he shared a bed with died. In the midst of that indifference and coldness, Princess Leila suffered so much grief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You took the most precious thing from me…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila closed her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She could visualize her beautiful mother and dependable older brother. And when she opened her eyes again…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This time, I’ll take away your precious things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The flames of revenge were burning in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Southern Army, led by Milton Forrest arrived at the outer edges of Lorentia, the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And of course, King August hadn’t made any preparations to host the Ceremony of Triumphant Return. He only sent a messenger ordering Milton to present himself at the palace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, a problem occurred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the borders of Lorentia, the Southern Army suddenly stopped moving. Not only did they stop moving, but they also set up camp with the capital right in front of them. It was as though they were still in the middle of a war. When this news spread, it caused a commotion in Lorentia, from the commoners to the nobles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it true that the Southern Army is camping less than two hours away from the Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s what they say.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But why? The Southern Army can’t be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…it could happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles in the capital were filled with anxiety. Not too long ago, the Second Prince had led the rebels within a short distance of the capital. And that time, it had been the Southern Army led by Milton Forrest who had saved them. But this time, it was the Southern Army that was camping right in front of Lorentia. It was only natural to feel anxious. But there was someone who was feeling even more anxious than them. It was King August, the current king.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How dare… How dare they…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Filled with anger, he couldn’t get his words out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was a demonstration of power. And a very obvious demonstration of power at that. What could Milton’s reason be for not coming when ordered and camping right outside the capital walls? He was showing that he could attack Lorentia at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was humiliating enough, but the problem didn’t end there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was only a small possibility, but if the Southern Army was to truly attack, then there was no way for King August to respond. All the soldiers in the capital had been wiped out by Duke Sean Palan. And he had even declared Princess Leila as his liege.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just in case, the king had sent a messenger, but he didn’t think it would help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, King August was trembling with anger, but soon that anger turned to fear. Although Princess Leila was his daughter, without a doubt, she held a grudge against him. When her mother and older brother had died seven years ago, King August hadn’t done anything and remained neutral. He had thought she had died with them, but she was still alive. And although the daughter he thought had died, returned, he wasn’t happy at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Currently, that daughter’s power&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;stronger than his…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And the feelings she held towards him were obviously detrimental for him. Far from being happy, every time he thought about it, his neck got cold. The love and warmth of family? He didn’t expect anything like that. In the first place, King August himself became king by stepping on the bodies of his family members. There was no guarantee that his own daughter, Princess Leila, wouldn’t make the same extreme choices. Muttering, King August grabbed his glass with a trembling hand.</span></p>
