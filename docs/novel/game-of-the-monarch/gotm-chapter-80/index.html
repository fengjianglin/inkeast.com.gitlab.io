 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After the meeting drew to an end, Duke Derek Brans retired to his tent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside was one woman who had been awaiting him, what an unexpected sight for any other pair of eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did the meeting end on good terms?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed it did, Claudia.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The lady who was awaiting Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in his personal tent was none other than the First Prince’s former wife Claudia, now a widow. She resided at ease in Duke Bran’s tent, and the air surrounding the two had completely transformed from prior. Duke Brans approached and kissed her as if he had always done so. Without a hint of repulsion, Claudia wrapped her arms around the Duke’s neck and responded in kind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If any other person saw this, they would have been at a complete loss for words. A man who had come on an expedition to wage war with a wife and children back in his homeland, was passionately embracing and pressing lips with a woman who had so recently lost her husband that she still wore robes of mourning. When the societal status of these two was also accounted for, this was a truly shocking scandal indeed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two softly looked at each other and wordlessly headed towards the tent’s bed. Before they knew it, they surrendered themselves to their instincts and indulged in each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After their primal desires were satisfied, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was the first to start the conversation with Claudia in his arms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whichever way I think about it, I believe it would be best if you return to my homeland first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You mean to send me off?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This war is about to become rough. You were safest at my side in the meantime, but that would likely not be the case going forward. It will be good and right for you to return to my homeland first, for it is dangerous here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Claudia made a sorrowful expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you pushing me away?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Most certainly not, no.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans firmly denied any such sentiment. He lovingly caressed Claudia’s cheek as he continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I say this for it truly will be dangerous to be at my side in the coming period. Please, go to my estate in my homeland and wait for me there. When I return, I shall officially take your hand as my wife.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Bran’s desperate plea, Claudia made a bashful expression and buried her head into his chest. She spoke with a small voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do not dare expect such a thing as the seat of a wife. In any case… a woman such as me from a nation such as this shall only bring you trouble.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Trouble? Who would dare suggest such a thing in front of me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yet I am a widow, am I not? A widow who has yet to shed her robe of mourning. If you take in such a woman as your wife, all the people of the world will reproach you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It doesn't matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“And of course, your wife&nbsp;</span><span>shan’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;greet me with open arms. I am not passing judgement on her. In fact, I understand her as a fellow woman.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Claudia…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was deeply moved, touched by Claudia’s thoughtfulness and consideration for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘How can such a lovely woman exist?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In reality, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was not originally a man who was easily seduced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There had been countless women who approached him due to the nature of his status, but he had never been particularly shaken up. He wedded his present wife for political reasons; and while he did not terrifically love her, she was a woman he had no grievances with either. In other words, he lived his entire life with a nonchalant disposition towards women.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Such a man had his heart stolen away by a lady for the first time since birth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was no hindrance that the subject of his affection was the wife of a foreign royal not too long ago, now a widow. That was how deep Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had fallen for Claudia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that he was to play a pivotal role in this war, he did not want the woman he loved to be placed in danger. As much as he yearned for her to be by his side, his heart felt as if it had knives driven into it whenever he imagined something happening to her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Claudia, my love, you are my everything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Derek…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please forgive me, for I must place your safety above all. I will take your hand in marriage when I return.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;meant what he said. He did not want to lose the woman before him, no matter how much the world would point their fingers at him. He was even willing to divorce with his wife if need be.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Claudia was already aware of Duke Bran’s sentiments. This was how it always went. The men who became interested in her always ended up devoting themselves wholeheartedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And she was skilled at using these men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I am scared. I’m afraid to go where you will not be.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Bran’s heart ached as Claudia pleaded like an orphaned kitten. But whenever he thought about how this battle was going to get ugly, he could not simply leave her by his side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What shall I do? How can I put your heart at ease, my love?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans asked earnestly, ready to give her everything he ever had if that was her desire. These were the words that Claudia had been waiting for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then… would you entrust me with your seal?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“My House’s seal? That can only be possessed by the present head of the&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Duchy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was admittedly taken aback. He did not think she would ask for him to hand over his seal out of all things.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know, but… I am uneasy. You say that you love me, but a woman always wants evidence. And so… would that be too much to ask for?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At Claudia’s plea, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;said the words he should never utter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I trust you. I will readily entrust you with it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah… thank you, Derek.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Claudia buried her head in Duke Bran’s embrace – and had the hints of a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘You can insist on most things if you take them to bed and beg with some tears afterwards. Why did the gods create men to be so foolish?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, Claudia departed from the battlefield the next day with an assigned guard detail.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Frankly, she did not want to stay here any longer even if Duke Brans did not mention it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After sending Claudia off, Duke Brans could now concentrate on the war at hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The operation he proposed to his commanders was to use none other than himself as bait to lure the brunt of the enemy’s forces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The greatest achievement on any battlefield, the accomplishment of which would greatly contribute towards victory, was to take down the head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Brans believed that just as they were aiming for Siegfried, he was a high-priority target for the Republican army. Along those lines, he anticipated that they could entice the enemy if he presented himself as bait.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, the Duke was well aware that there would be risks involved – but this did not faze him. He had a penchant for approaching warfare with a pure show of strength rather than overcomplicating matters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">More than anything, he was confident in his own abilities. He was capable of repelling any attack and believed he could save his own skin even in the worst of situations. After all, it was because he had such confidence in the first place that he suggested he should play the role of bait.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;took a minimal detail of troops and relatively distanced himself from the other detachments. He deliberately stationed himself where it would be difficult to be promptly reinforced if the enemy came raiding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke boldly hoisted his flag into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘There, the stage has been set. Come at me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried immediately discerned his enemy’s tactic as he watched them from his elevated reconnoitering position.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A lure, is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To Siegfried, it amounted to less than a child’s mockery of a scheme, clear as day at first glance. Rather, their plans were so obvious that it acted to provoke him in other ways.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So he’s that confident in his own strength. I see how it is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is your command, sir?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Behind Siegfried, one of the Black Skulls was attached to him as a bodyguard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, what do you reckon Jake?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the same black armor and skull-shaped helmet of this man called Jake, he stuck out like a sore thumb. At first glance, what was immediately noticeable was the colossal sword that the man had strapped to his back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Was it a two-handed sword? No, this was much larger than any conventional two-hander. Never mind any normal man wielding it – the sword boasted such comically massive dimensions that it looked malformed and would be difficult to even carry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But such a sword did not appear unwieldy for this man, for Jake was equally large in stature. A height towering over two meters was accompanied by broad shoulders, and thick-as-can-be arms that could easily snap a bear’s neck in half.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Such a man talked to Siegfried with considerable politeness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is a clear attempt at provocation, but I believe this presents an opportunity in some respects. You only need to give the order, and I shall bring the head of the one who does not know his place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His attitude was not a result of him putting on a front while flattering a superior, but derived from genuine respect and absolute obedience towards Siegfried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried answered as if that was truly possible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You could, if you were to take the Ghosts and strike.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ghosts were the official designation of the unit that wore the skull-shaped helmets. This special forces unit was created at the request of Siegfried to the Fuhrer by recruiting talents from all over the Hildess Republic. It was under the direct command of the Fuhrer’s office, and reported only to the Fuhrer – being exempt from the command hierarchy of the Republican army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At least, that was how they were known inside the Republic. However, the leader of the Ghost Unit, Jake, was already one of Siegfried’s men. What this meant was that Siegfried already wielded the power of a unit under the direct command of the Fuhrer’s office, and the Fuhrer was none the wiser.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried closely observed the enemy’s lines.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Duke Derek Brans… if we leave him alive, he will become a nuisance in later days when we turn to conquering the Strabus Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will you eliminate him?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmm, the weeds should be removed when we have the chance.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried replied calmly as if it was a matter of course.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, the Black Skull rascals have appeared in the rear encampments.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dispatch knights at once. Mobilize the knight’s order under my direct command.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, understood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;clicked his tongue after he gave his order.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk, cowards…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the fact that he was blatantly showing an opening, the enemy was explicitly striking the zones where he was not present – and it displeased him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He queried the commanders with him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The enemy refuses to bite our lure right away. Shall we present ourselves as being more defenseless?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commanders objected adamantly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Grace, we cannot reduce the guard detail more than we already have.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please keep in mind that you are a treasure of our nation, Your Grace.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans let out a sigh. Though he had exposed himself to such an extent to entice the enemy, they only continued to attack other areas of their lines.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That may be so, but can we truly afford to drag along this tiresome song and dance?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With all due respect, it may be a different story if we knew the enemy’s whereabouts at the least, but at present…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commanders bowed their heads apologetically.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was the biggest issue of this battle: they still could not discern the enemy’s whereabouts. The enemy continued to sporadically harass them through surgical guerilla warfare. They could not estimate where the brunt of the enemy’s army was situated as the attacks came from a plethora of different directions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It felt as if they were fighting an unseeable enemy inside a thick fog. At this rate, it was of no benefit that they had the superior numbers or even if they were to have the edge in quality of troops.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was then that one commander chimed in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How about withdrawing the army for the time being instead?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Withdraw the army?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed. In the first instance, the lay of the land is far too disadvantageous for us. As it is situated close to the hills and mountains, the conditions are too favorable for the Hildess Republic’s mountain soldiers to carry out their activities.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmm… that is true.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We would not be so greatly affected by their raids if much of the surrounding topography did not consist of mountains.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other commanders seemed to agree. Though it was humiliating for them to retreat with an army several times the size of the enemy, at this rate their losses would only gradually increase like a shirt being drenched over time by a light drizzle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see that there’s no helping it. Let us withdraw the army for now, and prudently search for an alternative route to take.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;decided to follow the will of his commanders, though at heart he was naturally irritated by the whole flow of the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It hurt his pride that someone like him, who was the type to emerge victorious in war through sheer might rather than resourcefulness, would order his army to withdraw against an enemy that was a fraction of their size – even if it was a strategic retreat. Though he respected the opinion of his commanders, who asserted that there was no other way…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It doesn’t sit well with me as expected.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His mood plummeted to a new low.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was then…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have an emergency report. We have discovered and are tracking what appears to be the enemy’s main camp.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve what?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;shot up from his seat, and the other commanders likewise looked astonished.</span></p>
