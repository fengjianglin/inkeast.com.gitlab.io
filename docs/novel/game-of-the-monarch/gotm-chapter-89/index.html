 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Count Forrest’s territory is in the South, not to mention, his new business is in full swing. It wouldn’t be right to send him up to the North right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At her words, one of the nobles spoke up with a regretful expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But Your Highness, even if we searched our entire country for someone to defend our borders, there is no one more dependable or stronger than Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the other nobles around him nodded in agreement. They had realized in this war how lazy they had become and how competent Milton was for having consistently prepared for war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Count Forrest, won’t you let go of your personal business and defend the Northern border for the sake of our country’s security?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Earnestly begging, Viscount Reagan looked towards Milton. In turn, Milton felt rather burdened by Reagan’s earnest request.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This guy is burdensome.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t like Viscount Reagan was a beautiful young lady, nor did Milton feel particularly moved by the earnest gaze of a middle-aged man. But, Reagan’s words were still reasonable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What should I do? I want to refuse, but I don’t have a good enough reason to do that… Should I just say no, knowing that they’re gonna get mad at me?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a second, Milton thought it wouldn’t be a bad idea to reject them and return back down to the South. &nbsp;He had saved the country once, but that didn’t mean he was that attached to it to keep saving them. But Princess Leila spoke even before Milton could.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Viscount Reagan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As we all know, Count Forrest has contributed the most and has the most military accomplishments from this war. Isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right, Your Majesty. I agree that Count Forrest’s achievements are commendable.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There wasn’t a single person in that gathering who didn’t recognize Milton’s achievements. As she saw the other nobles agree, Princess Leila continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I haven’t even been able to award him for his achievements from the war. Do I need to be burdened even further?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Reagan couldn’t say anything in response. He had recommended Milton because he had come to mind when thinking about who would be the most suitable to stabilize the northern border. But when Viscount Reagan heard her words, he thought he had been too brazen and turned crimson with shame.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She turned to look at the rest of the nobles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Without a doubt, Count Forrest would unequivocally agree if I asked him to defend the North.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Nope, you’re wrong. I’m never going to agree to it.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton didn’t agree with the princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, it’s Count Forrest…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He would definitely agree.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other nobles all seemed to sympathize with Princess Leila’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Do these old farts take me as a pushover?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wanted to say something, but he held back. It seemed as though Princess Leila was priming the nobles for something with her unique beauty and speech, so he decided to watch for now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I should just watch the play she’s putting on and eat some popcorn.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila continued to talk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have been indolent. We took peace for granted and didn’t do anything to keep that peace. And we have paid the price for that indolence. Isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Princess, it’s a tragedy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have no words for it, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please punish us, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles who had gathered here were still those who retained their honor, pride, and patriotism. Those were the only types of nobles left. Princess Leila listened to the nobles’ self-reflection and regret, then drove the final nail into the coffin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then do you think it is right to rely solely upon Count Forrest to defend our country? Do you truly think it is right for you to ignore your own obligations to the country and thrust all the responsibilities onto one person?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At her</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;words, it was like they had been smacked on the head and they were finally able to refocus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is exactly as Your Highness the Princess has said.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please punish these foolish people, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please correct us, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, there were even nobles who were sobbing and wailing. Princess Leila’s charisma combined with their naivety and innocence, the nobles were moved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Watching this display, Milton thought to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘So this is how cults are made. They’re born from this kind of an atmosphere.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the meantime, he decided to be more alert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After&nbsp;</span><span>confusing the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hell out of them, Princess Leila continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Duke Palan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, My Liege?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Duke Palan with confidence, Princess Leila gave him a command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I plan to have you defend the Northern border.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If that is your command, I will give my life to carry out My Liege’s orders.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess turned to speak to the nobles around her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is essential that we increase our Knights in order to increase our military strength. I want all of you to send the young Knights in each of your family. I will have them serve under Duke Palan’s command so that he may guide them as they help to defend our Northern border.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the nobles willingly agreed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will send my son and all the knights in my territory who are in their twenties, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have three sons in my family. I will send all of them, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will also do it, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Milton had the greatest accomplishments in this war, Duke Palan’s prestige was still great. And if there was an opportunity to serve under the command of Duke Palan and to receive guidance from him as well? It was no wonder the nobles were scrambling to send their own sons and the knights from their territories. With that one move, Princess Leila had both the nobles’ full cooperation and increased the Knights within her military.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She stood up from her seat and raised her sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kneel down Duke Palan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Duke Palan knelt, Princess Leila lifted her sword and tapped both of his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Duke Sean Palan, I appoint you as the Margrave of the North and give you full authority. Please protect this country from the beast that is the Republic.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will give you my life to carry out your commands, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so, Duke Palan became the Margrave of the North and was given Princess Leila’s promise to fully support him in his efforts to stabilize the North.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, she called Milton forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kneel down Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton knelt and Princess Leila spoke as her sword tapped both of his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Count Milton Forrest. I raise your rank by one and appoint you as a Marquis.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">So far, everything was as expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Also, I appoint you as the Margrave of the South and acknowledge your right to govern the Southern Region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will do my best to govern the Southern Region, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the others were a bit surprised, this had been previously discussed between Princess Leila and Milton. But the others were just merely surprised. After all, it was understandable. Milton’s influence on the nobles in the Southern Region was absolute and giving him the title of Margrave was just formalizing it. It wasn’t something that would cause a big change.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the biggest surprise was Princess Leila’s next statement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And because the Capital has been completely destroyed by the Republic, I designate Marquis Forrest’s Estate as the temporary Capital and appoint Marquis Forrest as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Army.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At those words, the other nobles were greatly shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The residence of the Marquis as a temporary Capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And on top of that, the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Army?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t unreasonable that nobles were so surprised. Designating Forrest Estate as the temporary Capital meant that for a while, the center of the country would be Forrest Estate. All executive orders would be issued from there and people and commodities would be concentrated there. Even if it was temporary, wouldn’t the Estate rapidly develop and gain economic benefits in the meantime? This was like a divine blessing for a fiefdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And on top of that, Princess Leila had taken it a step further and made Milton the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Army. The Central Army commanded all the military forces within the Capital and for generations was the head of the Royal Knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What this all meant was beyond imagination. On a smaller scale, designating Forrest Estate as the temporary capital and handing over the largest military was to avoid any possible power struggle while respecting Milton’s authority as the Margrave. On a bigger scale, it was like giving the single individual, Milton Forrest, the country’s entire military sector. To give someone who wasn’t even thirty this kind of important position wasn’t common in the history of the Lester Kingdom. The gathered nobles were surprised, but Milton was just as surprised as they were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This princess is really wild.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t enough to describe her as unconventional.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Status, military, economy, honor, etc… &nbsp;It was impossible to grasp exactly how much support he was receiving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… Yes, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton barely recovered from his shock to answer her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Milton heard a message that couldn’t be heard by anyone else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[The opportunity to become a monarch has come.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[You have leveled up]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Characteristic ‘Clout’ has evolved and become ‘A Hero’s Halo.’]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Sweet!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His level had finally gone up after a long time. Milton barely registered all the congratulating words and hurried back to his quarters as soon as possible. As soon as he was alone, he immediately checked the status window.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Marquis Milton Forrest]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Monarch LV. 4</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Strength — 82 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command — 87</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Intelligence — 82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics — 70</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Loyalty — 100</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Special Traits - Monarch’s Dignity, Hero’s Halo, Strategy</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Monarch’s Dignity LV. 2:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Your presence alone instils faith in allies and strikes fear into enemies. Vassals’ loyalty can be greatly increased through apt reward and punishment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hero’s Halo LV. 1: Ability to draw strong support and respect from the people. Even if an unreasonable policy is established, public support is not lost. On the battlefield, it can become the enemy’s target.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Strategy LV. 4: Excellent ability to see the overall flow of war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Overall, the stats had gone up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In particular, the Politics stats had gone up significantly, but this was probably because Milton’s reputation and presence in the Lester Kingdom had equally grown.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But, what Milton liked the most was the new Hero’s Halo special trait.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hero’s Halo LV. 1: Ability to draw strong support and respect from the people. Even if an unreasonable policy is established, public support is not lost. On the battlefield, it can become the enemy’s target.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This is dope.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was such an influential power that South Korean politicians would even sell their souls if they could get it in their hands. Disregarding the fact this was a kingdom and that Milton was a nobleman, the influence of public sentiment was still strong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘The Monarch’s Dignity and the Hero’s Halo. If I use these two characteristics together then…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a second, Milton saw the different possibilities in his future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Forget it, that’s not me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter the ability, if it wasn’t meant to be, then there was no use. Milton abandoned his regrets and checked how his estate was doing in the status window.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Territory -&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Manor (Temporary Capital)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Population - 135,724 people</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Funds - 352,761 gold</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Main products - wheat, barley, oat, wood, fur, wool, horse, cheese, marine, fish, copper</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Main facilities - copper mine, ports</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Development Possibilities- Academy, Royal Palace, Temple</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Military Power - 112 Knights, 520 Knight trainees, 2500 cavalry, 12000 infantry, 7000 archers</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Significant Detail - The Estate has been designated as the temporary Capital and the Golden Age has arrived. Your territory can be highly developed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is insane.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton felt his heart pounding. He had predicted that when Princess Leila designated his estate as the temporary capital that it would become developed to some extent. &nbsp;But when he checked the status window, it just said that the Golden Age had arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This is okay, right? Everything’s going well, right? It’s not like a native will suddenly appear and argue for an equivalent exchange of corn and gold, right?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having hit such a large jackpot, Milton couldn’t believe all this was real. Looking at the status window, it seemed as though the development of the mine and port had been completed. That meant that Sophia and Max, who had been in charge of the territory, had fully met Milton’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But why did the military power suddenly increase so much? Didn’t I lose troops during the war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton couldn't understand how the military power had multiplied. But when he thought about it, he instantly understood the reason.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. I’m the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Army now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From now on, the Central Army had to obey Milton’s orders. He realized that he wasn’t just a heavyweight in the South, but he now had influence over the entire country. Milton now had over 20,000 troops that he could move however he wanted. When he had taken over the estate in the past, there were barely 100 soldiers in total.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’ve become really successful.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he thought about pathetic past self, he felt proud of all of his achievements up to this point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just as Milton was feeling proud of himself…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, are you inside?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rick’s voice could be heard from outside his quarters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have something to tell you, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With Milton’s permission, Rick entered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No, to be more precise, Rick and Tommy, and unexpectedly, even Viscount Sabian.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What an odd group.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s wrong? Why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his question, Rick turned serious and knelt down. Once Tommy had knelt down as well, the two grabbed their swords on their waist and gave them to Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forgive me, My Lord. I would like to return my sword back to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forgive me, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
