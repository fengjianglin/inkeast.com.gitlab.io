 <p style="text-align: left"><span>While the Capital was descending into chaos, Milton was concentrating on developing his estate as usual. The estate’s development had accelerated a notch with the recruitment of Sophia, and consequently, the&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;lands were transforming on a day-by-day basis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the midst of this busy but fruitful period, an unexpected guest came seeking Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where did you say she hails from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“She says she is the daughter of a certain Marquis Raphael from the Florence Principality, and she wishes to invest in us after witnessing our growth potential during her travels.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Milton nodded at Max’s report. The Florence Principality was a state that was south of the Lester Kingdom. It did seem like a good idea to start forming connections with the Principality, as it was close to the&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;territories.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It would be worthwhile to meet them face-to-face.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I won’t be available for lunch, so formally invite them to a talk over dinner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With how occupied Milton was in recent times, he finally understood why mealtimes were such a handy time to meet people. Sine he was so busy that he could sense the clock ticking and time wasting away even when eating, it was better to kill two birds with one stone by meeting people over meals.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As it became evening, the guest met Milton at last.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is my pleasure to meet you. I am Ariel Raphael.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guest who sought him had all the grace and elegance of a typical noble’s daughter, y</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">et Milton felt a strange sense of familiarity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What’s this feeling of déjà vu?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Count Milton Forrest. It is my pleasure to meet you as well, Lady Raphael.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For now, Milton courteously exchanged greetings. He</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was silently impressed when he saw the two escort knights she brought with her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘They’re both Experts – and look stronger than me at that.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Being a noble from a foreign nation, Milton did not know what sort of House the Raphael family was; but he could project their considerable power from the fact that the daughter of the family could bring two Experts as mere escorts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two sat down and started on their dinner. During the meal, Milton inwardly observed his guest’s demeanor.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The etiquette one displayed during meals was a rough yardstick of their societal rank. From time to time, there were those among the Southern nobles that had not been properly educated on mealtime manners – though Milton himself would never point it out.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the etiquette of the woman before him was the pinnacle of perfection.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even the way in which she would lower the knife onto the plate without so much as a clink was a talent in its own right.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘How sadistic must your etiquette teacher be to become like&nbsp;</span><span>that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Milton recalled the miserable nicety training he himself received growing up, he simply had to be impressed at her mealtime manners.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After the main course, some light alcohol was brought out for closure – and with it, Milton started the conversation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did the meal suit your tastes, my lady?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, it was splendid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A relief to hear. I worried it may offend your tongue since you come from beyond these parts and all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for your solicitude, but everything was superbly to my taste and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Please give the chef my gratitude.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As they amicably chatted for a while, Milton got down to business first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that you wish to invest in our lands after seeing them. Where would you like to invest in particular?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was filled with the anticipation of a looming deal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What if I wish to invest in you yourself, Count Forrest?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pardon?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was taken aback at her answer. The lady gently smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After ruminating over the meaning of her words, Milton replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Invest in me, you say? Hmm… I’m afraid there’s not much I can offer in the way of returns for such an investment – what shall we do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is no need to concern yourself with that, for I am sure more than enough will come back around. As for the investment itself… will this much do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, the lady slid forward an envelope she prepared. A lady-in-waiting retrieved the envelope and handed it to Milton, who read the contents inside. His eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">100,000 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside was a promissory note for as much as 100,000 gold.&nbsp;</span><span>A value close to double the&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;estate’s liquid assets was being offered so nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Who is this woman?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton’s expression hardened.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">100,000 gold was not an amount that a run-of-the-mill noble’s daughter could put forward so lightly. Milton instantly realized that the lady before him was not some ordinary investor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I would like to ask some questions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, be my guest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Milton flipped into an icy attitude, the woman replied without a touch of wavering.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Ariel, hailing from the Marquess House of Raphael in the Florence Principality.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Milton racked his brain as she introduced herself again with the same politeness as always.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘So she’s squarely not going to let up? Fair enough.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was not so foolish as to happily accept a fortune offered by someone whose identity was a mystery, let alone their objectives.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘At the least, if I could figure out her identity… oh!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had momentarily forgotten about his ability. Though he could not catch wind of his opponent’s goals, he may be able to discern her identity with his powers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Let’s have a look, shall we?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton opened up the guest’s stats.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Wait, what!?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton clenched his fist, almost standing up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Leila von Lester]</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The high stats and abilities were&nbsp;</span><span>awe-striking</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but what was truly astounding was her true name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">‘Leila von Lester? Surely&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">not Princess</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;Leila?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a name Milton knew well – no, there was likely no one in this country who had not heard of this name.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The issue was that as far as Milton</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">knew</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">and as was common knowledge, she had perished 7 years ago. That person was in front of him right now in the flesh, alive and breathing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Let’s – let’s think about this.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton used all the leads he had to lay the groundwork of the bigger picture in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that Princess Leila, deemed dead, was alive and well before him right now; the mountainous sum of money she offered as an investment; the recent incidents surrounding the Charlotte Merchant Company in the</span><span>&nbsp;Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400">; and finally, the mysterious third faction that Milton came to knew when he met Duke Palan during his time at the&nbsp;</span><span>Capital...&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tying it all together, Milton formed the outlines of a massive tapestry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><em>‘Charlotte, Ariel, and Princess Leila – all three were the same person. Then everything should click together.’</em></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was like a light was shone onto this tapestry, with all the puzzle pieces now put in their place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why did the Charlotte Merchant Company show interest in him?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was because they wanted to convert a noble from the outskirts into their side, where the Central region’s fingers could not reach.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why was a titan like Duke Palan backing not the First or Second Princes, but a third force?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was because Princess Leila was also legitimate royalty and not only that, but she was the rightful heir to the throne in terms of the lineage sequence. Duke Palan’s willing support of her was more than possible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why was the Charlotte Merchant Company suddenly razed to the ground with all sorts of charges and accusations?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was likely that her true identity was discovered. The First and Second Princes tried to kill her as a result, so Princess Leila jumped ship to a new identity she had prepared in advance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why was Princess Leila saying such and such about ‘investing in him’ to try and drag specifically him into taking their side, offering a fortune?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was likely because what Princess Leila desired was to make the whole Southern detachment of nobles into her faction, achievable through Milton as he was taking center stage in this region.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Finally, why was she doing all this in the first place?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was only one answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This is all to get herself the crown. This princess is genuinely vying for the throne.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All Milton had done was discover his guest’s identity, but it was sufficient to discern everything about her goals and ambitions. All the dots were connected to form the big picture.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘How should I use this information?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Milton calmly looked at Princess Leila, his head was whirring with scenarios.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">To Princess Leila, Milton must have appeared to be hesi</span><span>tating</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;about her offer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s not much to be considered so thoroughly, is there? You only need to think of this as an excellent funding opportunity</span><span>.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Count Forrest?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She gazed at the silent Milton as if pressing him to answer. Watching her, Milton sighed and grumbled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s enough. No matter which way I see it, nothing will&nbsp;</span><span>come of</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;hiding it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I mean that the play’s over.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess Leila.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instantly, the two knights standing behind Princess Leila openly exuded a killer’s intent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><em>‘Huh!?’</em></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Milton immediately wondered if it would have been better to keep his mouth shut. At the least, it would have been better to ensure Jerome was at his side before he said those words</span><span>, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ut the dam had already been broken.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Milton had racked his brain for a way to capitalize on this situation without revealing his opponent’s identity</span><span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;but try as he may, he could not see a clear strategy forward. Rather, he had a stronger premonition that there would be no next time if he did not catch her unaware right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">When they first met, she had been Charlotte</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the owner of a conglomerate, and now she was a Florence Principality noble’s daughter. There was no guarantee that she did not have other masks to play with.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so he concluded that he would see an end to this, right here and now. Milton also hoped to extract some valuable information by unsettling her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Taptaptaptaptap…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila was deep in thought as she drummed on the table with her fingers. What seemed like an eternity passed before she came to a conclusion, after which her first words were…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve simply got no idea.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She looked at Milton straight in the eye and continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From where did you catch wind of my identity?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s a secret.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What if I just had to know?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, the two knights behind Princess Leila inched forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton flashed a glance at them and grimaced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Shit, both of them are definitely stronger than me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Their Strength stat</span><span>s were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;83 and 85 respectively. His chances would be slim enough if there was just one of them, but there was almost no hope of taking on them both. It would be a tall order to hold out until help arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead, Milton became even more determined.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She would’ve killed me already if she really wanted to. I need to be even surer from here on.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had a carefree smile on his face as he stood his ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What benefits</span><span>&nbsp;will there be</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to reap&nbsp;</span><span>in killing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">me here,</span><span>&nbsp;Your&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I die, my knights would surely cause an upheaval, turning every unturned stone as they find the culprit at once. Once you</span><span>&nbsp;have the world’s eye on you</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, you would need to quickly throw away this new identity that you so painstakingly&nbsp;</span><span>arranged.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what will it be? Will you still try?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila clicked her tongue.</span></p>
