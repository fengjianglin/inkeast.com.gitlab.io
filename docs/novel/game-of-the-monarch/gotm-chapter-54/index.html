 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, there was just one person who anticipated this turn of events.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At present, that person was elegantly drinking a cup of black tea in Forrest territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I was right in the end, wasn't I?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… what dark magic is this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton said as he watched Princess Leila form a detestable smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, Milton talked to Princess Leila with the proper respect and mannerisms for treating a superior when he had discovered her identity. But after some time had passed since they began living together, Princess Leila implicitly allowed Milton to speak more casually. Her supposed pretext was that <span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1)">in order to ensure her identity remained hidden,</span> Milton needed to mind how natural he sounded when he spoke to her in front of others.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whatever the case was, Princess Leila had continued to patiently reside at the Forrest Estate, passing the time day by day. She seemed so carefree that Milton once asked if she really had the liberty to be passing her time like this. Her response was…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[The seeds have already been spread, Count. Now is a time to wait patiently for the right moment.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[You speak as a mastermind would; as if you know all that will happen from this point on.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Yes, I am something along those lines.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton laughed as he felt that she was bluffing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[You don’t seem to believe me.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Ah, I may have let that slip.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Very much so. I suppose there’s no convincing you, but if you continue providing your services just a little longer… Soon, the First Prince and his faction will be the ones to seize the royal prerogative in the Capital. That future is near – the victor will likely be decided within the month.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Will it really now…]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton did not believe her. There was no way that the stalemate between two princes as they fought over many years would collapse so suddenly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila smiled at Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Shall we place a bet? 500 gold.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Call!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[……?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[I mean, I shall partake in this bet.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before a month passed, news came from the Capital: the First Prince exposed the military corruption in the Second Prince’s faction, and the strength of the Second Prince's forces was reduced by more than half.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Was I not correct?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[…How on earth?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[I made preparations for this beforehand. I secretly leaked information regarding the faction of the Second Prince's weaknesses to the First’s faction.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[…Are you conning me?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Oh my, are you going back on your word after you lost?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton formed an icy expression at her words. She continued to smile teasingly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Or shall we play another round? According to my calculations, I do believe that the Second Prince will feign a declaration of surrender to the First Prince, then, he'll retreat to the North where he has strong backing. There, he will begin a civil war.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[A civil war? How preposterous… if anything, the First Prince would not let the Second Prince make his way to the North scot-free, would he?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[It will all unfold as I say. Shall we make a bet once more if you still don't believe me? How about 5000 gold this time?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[Very well. Let's see what happens.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was full of confidence.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t think for a second that the First Prince was stupid enough to let his brother go to the North – and even if it did happen, he certainly didn’t think that the Second Prince was a villain so blinded by power that he would start a civil war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The results of this bet were out now.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The First Prince was stupid, and the Second Prince was a villain blinded by the pursuit of power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Damn it…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila took a sip of her black tea while Milton maintained a deadpan expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That will be 5500 gold altogether. Making money is light work, wouldn’t you agree?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Does this girl start every day thinking of how to make my blood boil?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton could not refute Princess Leila’s incessant teasing, because everything she said was right.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Perhaps that 92 Intelligence and 91 Politics weren’t just for show.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was not convinced there was no point in doubting her abilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Though her personality is a different story.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At any rate, Milton could no longer pass off her words as nonsense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you think will happen from now on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? Did you want to hear it for free?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re staying for free at my… never mind, you're not.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact that Princess Leila had invested a considerable fortune did not change. Milton sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it you desire?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm… let's keep it on credit, for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“On credit, you say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes – I speculate that keeping you indebted may prove to be more useful down the line, Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton received an unpleasant pang, but he did not pursue the matter further as he believed that hearing Princess Leila’s insight came first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Firstly, the royal palace will soon issue an order of subjugation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can see that they would.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton could see that much on his own. The Second Prince was on the brink of causing a civil war with the rationale that he would advocate for Republicanism. Though his motivations for doing so were yet unknown, at face value this was a suicidal move. Republicanism was deemed to be a dangerous ideology by not only the Lester Kingdom, but all the kingdoms on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As long as he submitted this as his justification for war, the First Prince could officially carry out an order of subjugation. Besides the Central Army at the Capital, the feudal nobles in the outer regions would certainly receive this order as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everything up to here was within Milton’s predictions – but what he did not foresee at all were Princess Leila’s next words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Count Forrest, you must find a way to be excluded from this mobilization order at all costs. If possible, it would prove to be beneficial if all the nobles of the South that you have contact with could preserve their strength.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton frowned and paused in thought for a while, before asking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This escapes my understanding. Why are you saying that we should stay clean of this matter?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter which way he looked at it, Milton could not think of a good reason to stay out of this war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the first place, this war could only be won from the side of the First Prince. The First Prince had become the righteous the moment the Second Prince brought Republicanism into this conflict. The feudal nobles that were maintaining neutrality, including his own forces – and on top of that, a considerable number of the nobles that had originally taken the Second Prince’s side – would see no other path but to turn to the First Prince. The concept of Republicanism was absolute heresy to a kingdom that operated on the basis of a class system.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was why, even if Milton did not play an unnecessarily active part in the war, he thought it would be wise to play it safe and fulfill his duties as they came, and that would be enough. In any case, as it was not like he had plans to enter the Capital’s political arena, he simply needed to play just enough of a role that he would not be brought to the attention of the First Prince.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rather, if he obstinately refused to participate in this easy of a war, Milton would be burning his bridges for his withdrawal from the fight when the First Prince ascended onto the throne. In the worst-case scenario, contrived slander could go around that Milton Forrest was a Republican sympathizer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>For these reasons, all he could think of were reasons he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">should&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">participate in the war. Yet Princess Leila was advising him that he should not – and he knew that she was not one to spout nonsense. Nonetheless, Milton still did not understand why.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila's expression turned grave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why do you think the Second Prince is suddenly advocating for Republicanism?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nothing came to mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In all honesty, the first thing that came to Milton’s mind when he heard that the Second Prince was suddenly turning to Republicanism was that he was a lunatic, and not much else. It seemed like the erratic action of a desperate man on the last precipice.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But now that he thought about it closely, it was admittedly strange.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Why Republicanism, out of all things? What benefit would he reap from doing that? …Ah!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A fleeting scenario brushed by his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Surely not… no matter what the circumstances are…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It seems you have realized.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Does the Second Prince mean to request for support from the Republics?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Precisely.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s nuts…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was in front of Princess Leila, but he could not stop himself from cursing. No matter how hellbent he was on acquiring power, how could the Second Prince invite foreign influences into his own country? In the event he did seize all the power there was, did he truly think that it would be his own?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Republics would not spill their own blood to help someone else’s cause. Even if they were to participate in the war, they would demand the price of blood to be shouldered entirely by the faultless people of the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What could that mongrel possibly be thinking of?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thinking, you say? If my memory serves me correctly, he’s not a man who knows how to think.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A kingdom’s prince does not think?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You wouldn’t know since you haven’t had the pleasure of meeting him. That’s simply how he is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was stricken with astonishment. Princess Leila sighed as she watched him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He has no interest in the future of the nation. He will only be at ease if the world revolves around him, no matter what that costs. No amount of blood spilled by the kingdom’s subjects or decaying of national strength is too great a price if it allows him to seize power.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hearing what you have to say – he seems like a real son of a bitch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“An apt judgment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton could only sigh when he suddenly had a lightbulb moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess Leila – you had anticipated this civil war, correct?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Correct.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And you also anticipated that the Second Prince would collude with the Republicans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it that you wish to say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For the completion of your objective, would I be correct to assume that you stayed silent regarding, or even encouraged, this country’s descent into civil war – well knowing that the blood of guiltless people will be spilt?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila coolly kept her silence at Milton’s interrogation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton patiently watched her, awaiting an answer. She finally responded to his unending gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What if I did?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then you are indeed no different than the First or Second Princes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila furrowed her eyebrows at his comments. It seemed that what Milton said was the greatest of insults to her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, give me an answer. If it is not the honest truth, then I’m afraid I cannot continue to ride the same boat as you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila felt the real resolve embedded in Milton’s words, and sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are half correct – and also half wrong.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you care to explain?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Amongst the forces of the North that were supporting the Second Prince, there were already ones that were colluding with the Republicans. I did not play a part in this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait… the nobles of the North border with the Republic, right? What do you mean that they were colluding, Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is the truth. They have been illegally trading with the Hildess Republic and secretly growing richer. This has been their standard practice for a while. Of course, the Second Prince was aware it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, do you mean to say that the Second Priices’s faction knew of this and turned a blind eye?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, because it brought gold. The profits they earned through black market trading proved to be a substantial source of funds for the Second Prince’s faction.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How could this be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The powers that be which backed the Second Prince were mostly knights and military authorities. Such forces consumed capital but would not produce any in return.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet Milton had never heard of the Second Prince’s faction losing out in the financial arena against the First Prince – and now it turned out it was because the Northern nobles created a source of income through illegal trading with a Republic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I suppose it’s true that committing evil is the easiest path to riches.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Taking part in illegal transnational trade without tariffs and whatnot would have meant the sum they made would have been nothing to scoff at.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Does that mean the Second Prince already had connections with the Republicans?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Indeed. I had planted some eyes within those circles to monitor the situation, and aimed to capitalize on the Second Prince’s weaknesses should</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the opportunity ever present itself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If that was the case, why did this civil war arise? If you could control this situation with your planted men…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The people I planted in the North have not managed to land pivotal roles in their operations. If my influence in the North was strong enough to control the overall circumstances, I would not have permitted a civil war to arise in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila sighed and continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If things unfold as planned, not long after the commencement of the civil war, the Second Prince will be purged by some ‘well-meaning’ nobles in the North.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are these ‘well-meaning’ nobles under your wing, Princess?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”I daresay more than half of them are unaware.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It implied that even now, she was pulling the strings as a strictly unknown mastermind.</span></p>
