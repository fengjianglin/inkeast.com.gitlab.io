 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Is this how I die?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Brans sensed his end looming.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘No, I absolutely can’t meet my end here. There’s a reason that I must return alive.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke pictured Claudia’s face and steeled himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘If I take care of that guy and capture Siegfried as a hostage… the chances are looking grim, but there’s a way out.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke resolved on his one path to survival.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come as you may. Entertain me until my very last.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Duke Brans’ lines made it seem as though he was bracing for death, though his inner heart was starkly different.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jake assumed his battle stance in response. And next to Jake, Siegfried also drew his blade and assumed a combat stance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke’s eyebrow twitched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you intend to throw your lot in as well, boy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you label me a coward?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph, I never expected you Republican dogs to play fair in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he gave a prickly answer, the Duke thought to himself that this was an optimal turn of events.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a duel between Masters, a weaker person trying to lend a helping hand only became a burden. In fact, Duke Brans believed that his probabilities of holding Siegfried hostage had just increased.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do apologize, but I prefer fights in which I will win without a doubt.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;“Very well. Then come-”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke almost let his sword slip out of his hands as he spoke. He had thought there would be no more that could faze him, with all that had happened in this short time. But this could not be anything but a complete blindside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am repeating myself, but I only choose fights in which I will win.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A vivid Aura Blade was enveloped around Siegfried’s sword as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, before the Duke were two enemy Masters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Siegfried readied himself and spoke to the stunned&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Now then – it is time for you to die, Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, the two of them attacked the Duke from two sides at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh… DAMN IT ALL!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Duke met their attack with all the energy he had ever mustered in his life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no logic to this, and nor was there hope.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was only lashing out for one last time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That was a considerable pain in the neck.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried muttered as he sheathed his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before him was the head of Duke Derek Brans, who had fought fiercely until the very end with a last hurrah. He had given it his all with two Masters as opponents – but he could not change an outcome that was already decided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the damage?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jake received a report from his subordinate and relayed it to Siegfried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So far, there has been 13 dead from the battle. But it appears 24 more will either die from critical wounds or be permanently discharged as cripples if they survive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Siegfried frowned at the report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“37 men out of 300… that would be over 10 percent. There’s still much room for improvement.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Siegfried murmured to himself and issued another order to Jake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Commence a cleanup of this site. Especially ensure that no hints remain of our losses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Understood. What will you do with Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;head?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hang it high atop a flag. We should make the most of this, after all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, as you command.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, Siegfried and his men scrubbed the site and disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duke Derek Brans’ death in battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The impact of his death was monumental. The death of a commander in war was a large enough matter to single-handedly flip the flow of a battle, but the death of the Duke reverberated beyond that. A cornerstone of the Strabus Kingdom’s practical strength, as well as one of the symbols of its might, had fallen. This was an enormous loss on a national level.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The Strabus Kingdom’s expedition army could not retreat after losing their commander as is. &nbsp;If they returned home with nothing but the news of losing Duke&nbsp;</span><span>Brans</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, all that awaited the command staff was the guillotine. For them to receive mercy, the least they could do was bring the head of Siegfried who had brought about this state of affairs in the first place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The staff’s decision to commit only brought a greater tragedy. For attempting to&nbsp;</span><span>foolhardily</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;continue the war with their prime commander gone, the Strabus Kingdom expedition army was exterminated. Not only did they lose the Master that was Derek Brans, but they lost their regular force of 50,000 troops in its entirety. This was an unforeseen catastrophe for the Strabus Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And beyond the Strabus Kingdom, things were also looking dire for the Lester Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“How will&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;lot of you take responsibility for this state of affairs?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take responsibility, you say? Why do you ask us to be responsible for the defeat of the Strabus Kingdom’s expedition army?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was it not the First Prince and his faction that requested the expedition troops?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Highness the First Prince has already passed away. And besides, it was His Royal Majesty the King who decreed that the expedition army could operate inside our nation. Yet you are asking us to take responsibility?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then who shall we ask, you incompetent, treasonous fools?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come again?! How dare the likes of you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles shouted at each other at this urgently called assembly, half-stricken with panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shock of the Strabus army’s total extinction was too much to bear for the nobles, who had thought their victory was assured.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the Strabus Kingdom’s army stepped in, the First Prince’s faction that had crashed and burned at one time had been revived ever so slightly. Though they fell to the bottom after shouldering the massive responsibility of their defeat in the civil war, the main culprit that was the First Prince had thankfully (?) committed suicide. They believed that if the Strabus Kingdom army – who had been requested in the name of the First Prince – was able to take back the North for the Lester Kingdom, the burden on their shoulders for their past failures would be substantially lifted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet no one imagined in their wildest dreams that the Strabus army would be defeated. The expedition army consisted of as many as 50,000 troops, with the Master and Duke Derek Brans personally participating. But no defeat could be as complete as this one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only option left for the First Prince’s faction was to thoroughly deny all responsibility to avoid the consequences. The lines that they went along were that the final approval for the expedition army’s activities was given by the current king and that they had no say in this matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, the other nobles were occupied with accusatory attacks on the nobles of the First Prince’s faction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila, who was still temporarily overseeing state affairs as a stand-in, observed the unfolding scene from the throne.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What a bunch of terrific men.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if the country were to fall to ruins tomorrow, before her were people that would still bicker on with their politicking for what they could gain today. With her current temperament, she wished to drag them all to the palace square and hang them by the neck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Though it’s not like this situation would become any better if I do that.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Concluding that there was no one in this royal hall that was reliable, Princess Leila left the fools in front of her to their squabbling and fell into her own thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Siegfried, huh… who knew there would be such a monster.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To tell the truth, Princess Leila herself did not anticipate that the expedition army would be defeated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had based her future plans for this war on the premise that the Strabus Kingdom’s army would emerge victorious. Now all those plans had become a tangled mess, and a million complex thoughts ran through her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The defeat of the expedition army had most certainly been outside her calculations. However, there were two things that were a compensatory relief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first was that the Southern army which Milton was commanding had perfectly routed the Hildess troops that were facing them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The second was that during this time, Duke Palan and a force of 20,000 soldiers had been stationed at the Capital to prepare for the minuscule chance that something went terribly wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We must recall Count Forrest immediately to defend the Capital.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed. Above all else, we must bolster the Capital’s defenses with the Southern army as Siegfried could invade at any moment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles too were well aware of the facts. In unison, they advised that Milton needed to fall back to the Capital and focus on defense with Duke Palan. Though they had previously treated Milton as a country bumpkin from the South who had only been at the right place at the right time, they were now desperately requesting that he swoop in and rescue them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila leaned her forehead on one hand in deep thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They would certainly be able to defend the Capital if they did that, but was that the right path forward?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘If I was in Siegfried’s shoes…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila felt a chill down her spine just thinking about the ways Siegfried could react, if they called Milton and the Southern army back to the Capital. But would it be possible to defend the Capital without Milton and his men if Siegfried came knocking?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘It would be a tall order even if we’re on the defense. Though Duke Palan’s a Master, he’s not exactly adept at warfare.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila was exceedingly troubled, properly checkmated, and unable to do this or that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ultimately, the royal hall assembly concluded with nothing but a heated, meaningless back and forth between the nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After the conference, a maid approached the exhausted Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess, one man is requesting an audience with you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At present, she was far too tired to meet just anyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He says he is Viscount Randol Sabian.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Viscount Sabian?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila frowned. She recognized the name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he accompanied the First Prince’s army as a commander, he found himself on the First Prince’s bad side and was unable to raise satisfactory results in the war. The one time he contributed meaningfully was when he joined the Southern army afterward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, that contribution was substantially encouraging. Using a superb diversion tactic, he lured out the turtling Second Prince’s army so they may be decimated on the open field. Princess Leila had been observing the battlefield at the time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton also judged Viscount Sabian very highly when mentioning him to Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">[He is, without a doubt, the greatest strategist of our nation.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Personally, Princess Leila likewise understood where Milton was coming from.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had invited the Viscount to join his command in this war, but he declined in order to carry out the funeral rite of his teacher, Marquis Trauss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Come to think of it, his existence slipped my mind after that.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila momentarily reproached herself before speaking to the maid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell him to enter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Princess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before long, a somewhat emaciated Viscount Sabian came face-to-face with Princess Leila.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I, Viscount Randol Sabian, a loyal subject of the kingdom, appear before Your Highness Princess Leila von Lester.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Enough with the formalities. Have a seat.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila offered him a seat on the table in front of her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian sat down and cut straight to the chase.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have heard that the Capital’s nobles insist on recalling Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have also heard, Princess, that you have deferred this request for now rather than accepting it at once.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That too is correct.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I may ask, Your Highness, what is your reasoning behind the deferment?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘He’s testing me. Is that how it is?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was a little insulted, but answered without restraint.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We would certainly be able to defend the Capital if I summon Count Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Indeed we would.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yet what of the districts outside the Capital? If we consolidate all of the country’s forces in the Capital, Siegfried would be free to infringe on our soil entirely unchecked. I cannot so gladly summon Count Forrest while conscious of this fact.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian inwardly nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘They may be siblings, but she and the First Prince are different. There might actually be a brain in there somewhere.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To Viscount Sabian, the First Prince had long been perceived as a fascinating creature who possessed no brain inside that skull of his.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he was not yet done with his testing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That may be so, but our nation’s very core will collapse if we cannot protect the Capital. Is it not true that the people of the kingdom are already bound to suffer in times of war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Leila made a rather displeased expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“One time, I can look over – but do I appear so unaware of the way of things that I must be tested twice?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry? What do you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If we were to only protect the Capital and allow the rest of our lands to be trampled on, the nation’s infrastructure would undoubtedly collapse – and more importantly, national sentiment of the royal family would plummet to the earth. If that were to happen, there would be no meaning in defending the Capital. In a worst-case scenario, socio-political think tanks who support Republicanism could incite the people into completely destroying the nation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…….”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was that a satisfactory enough answer for your tests?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Princess Leila’s words, Viscount Sabian stood up from his seat and respectfully kowtowed to her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I must deeply apologize for daring to commit the sin of testing Your Highness. I humbly ask that you release your anger.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Sabian sincerely apologized, and Princess Leila relaxed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rise.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Viscount sat back down, and they faced one another once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And although it had only been a short while since they had met, they started forming an assessment of each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘She’s not a woman who’s found herself with power merely through luck or by twirling the good Count Forrest under her thumb with her beauty. She’s definitely got the wisdom and cast of mind fit for a royal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Never mind his cleverness – he’s got guts as well. I thought there wouldn’t be a single noble in the royal Capital who would test me at this point, but who knew there would be such a bold man.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And the two of them reached the same conclusion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I see that this woman isn’t a bad influence for the good Count Forrest.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This man won’t be a bad influence for Count Forrest.’</span></p>
