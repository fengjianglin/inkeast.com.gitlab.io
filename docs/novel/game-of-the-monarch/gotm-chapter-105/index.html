 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet had completely hidden her strength, but for Milton to have seen through it, that meant that his state was stronger than hers was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can’t be… Marquis, you've already reached that high state?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knight, Carl, who had been standing next to her, was startled by her quivering voice. He knew very well what she meant when she said, ‘high state.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton smiled at Princess Violet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who knows, what do you see?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>She had a guess, but she couldn’t exactly say it. He stood right in front of her, but seeing how she couldn’t accurately read his state, that meant that they were at least equal. Just that alone was surprising. But can it be? Could he really have reached the high state? She knew that Milton was now in his mid-20s, but, to think that he’s reached this point at that age? Princess Violet had often heard that she was a genius, but now the thought that Milton was even more of a&nbsp;</span><span>genius than she was crossed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;her mind. And as soon as she realized that…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Marquis. Please, please give me a chance. I must make a big contribution during this war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She asked him wholeheartedly. Originally, she had planned to prove her strength to Milton and win the vanguard position from him. But wouldn’t it be unreasonable of her to do that if the other person was far better than her in terms of skills? For her, when she had to accomplish something great during this war, this was a disaster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton looked at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have a question for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, ask.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess Violet, why are you personally participating in this war? And why are you so desperately wanting to achieve something?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet bit her lower lip. After hesitating for a bit, she let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry, Marquis. I can’t tell you that right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can’t tell me the reason… I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Milton’s response seemed to indicate refusal, Princess Violet hastened to explain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry, but that has something to do with the inner workings of Florence Principality.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not that I don’t understand, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Princess Violet continued to quickly speak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please… if you accept my request, I’ll do whatever I can do for you. Whatever you want… I’ll agree to it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Carl, her knight, tried to stop her as she continued to speak urgently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Princess, you shouldn’t recklessly say such things…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please be quiet, Sir Thomas. There’s no way we can retreat now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be quiet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She turned to look at Milton with eyes filled with distress and urgency.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton gave her a strained smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You seem to have misunderstood something.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Marquis?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I just asked for the reason and even if you don’t tell me, that’s fine. It has nothing to do with the war itself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet looked stunned for a moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton continued to speak with a bright smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As long as there isn’t a problem with your abilities, a position that matches your abilities will be given, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You mean… I still have a chance to accomplish something?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“More than enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his words, she let out a sigh of relief. What worried her the most was that because she was a woman, she would have been an outcast and wouldn’t have any opportunities to make a big enough contribution to the war. That was why, even knowing the dangers, she had wanted to be at the forefront of the war. As long as she could be victorious, it was a position where achievements were most clearly visible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But from Milton’s perspective, there was no need to discriminate against her. Just looking at her stats alone, she was an outstanding knight. She made him wonder whether Princess Violet alone could defend a narrow passage if they were to retreat. There was no reason for him not to use her just because she was a woman. Rather, it’d be regrettable if she refused to work with him. Still, just in case, there was one thing to make sure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But, please keep one thing in mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, speak.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As long as I am the commander of this war, you and your troops must be under my command, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She responded happily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, that’s only natural. Until this war is over, we will obey your commands and fight under you, Marquis. I promise you this as the representative of Florence Principality’s royal family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton smiled cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, until this war is over, let’s work hard together, Princess Violet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Yes,&nbsp;</span><span>the best</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of luck to us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton had thought there were only useless shits in the Allied Forces, but he had found a very talented and useful person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Once the banquet was finished, the Allied Forces&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;officially established. The Allied Forces leaving the capital, Tempeulliche, were now completely under Milton’s command and were marching towards the battlefield. However…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean we’re not going to the Northern Front? How can you make such a decision arbitrarily?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Milton led the army East towards the Eastern Front and not the Northern Front, the leaders from the other countries immediately rebelled. Count Dios, in particular, took the most offense. It was almost as if he had heard someone cursing at his parents instead of information on the direction they were heading.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How can you just arbitrarily decide the army’s course without talking to us? Are you ignoring us?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at Count Dios screaming and yelling, Milton was reminded of Korea, something he hadn’t been for a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Huh, so as long as you’re the loudest, you think you’re the best?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And while they hadn’t directly confronted him, the people standing behind Count Dios all had a displeased expression on their face. Seeing how the leaders of the four other nations, except Princess Violet, all complained to him, Milton thought to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘As expected.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although it was something that he had already expected, it still didn’t feel great seeing such outright dissatisfaction from them. And so, with as much arrogance as possible, Milton spoke to them, half sincerely half acting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have been given full control over the Allied Forces. Naturally, it’s my decision where I lead the army, but you’re telling me that I need your permission to do so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t that natural?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh… natural?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. How can you decide the course of this army without saying a single word to us? Are you ignoring us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then… what? What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right, I’m ignoring you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have a problem with that, you greenhorn?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, Count Dios couldn’t fully comprehend Milton’s words. But the moment he did, his face turned crimson.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have gravely insulted us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You… You have insulted our honor and I demand an apology! Otherwise…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Count Dios placed his hand on his sword buckled to his waist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton looked at him with cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re insane.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you just say…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton stood up as he looked at the dumbfounded Count Dios.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mutiny towards the commander during a war. No, maybe this should be taken as a military rebellion?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Milton reached for his own sword while saying those words, Count Dios was rather dismayed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Ah… this wasn’t supposed to happen.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he had placed his hand on his sword’s hilt, it was both an appeal and a threat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-indent: 36pt; text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I’m angry right now, so don’t ignore me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Up until then, most people had taken a step back and made concessions when Count Dios had done this. But Milton had spoken of mutiny and confronted him instead. It was obvious who would win if they were to duel. Count Dios was not capable enough to support his hot temper. If he was to actually duel against Milton, it was obvious who would lose. At that moment, the person who saved him was Marquis Johannes who had been standing behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Hahahaha… Let’s calm down, Marquis&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Although Count Dios shouldn’t have said that, don’t you think you’re overreacting?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Johannes stepped in to intervene, but Milton was too annoyed to let it go.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He showed the intent to rebel against his commander during wartime. According to military law, there would be no arguments even if I were to behead him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Well, that’s… isn’t it a special case right now? Do we need to observe military&nbsp;</span><span>laws this strictly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;when everyone is from a different country?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, we should.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Look here, Marquis&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton interrupted Marquis Johannes</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“During special circumstances like this, I see no reason why military laws cannot be observed just because our countries are different. If we were to accept such special cases, then the army would collapse.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Scratching his head in annoyance, he continued to talk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How could you come to war without even knowing this? Damn, this is why beginners…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He mumbled the last sentence as if talking to himself, but it clearly reached the ears of Marquis Johannes and the people standing behind him. Marquis Johannes’ face hardened once he heard it. Until now, Marquis Johannes felt that even if Milton didn’t treat him respectfully, at least he gave him the respect as an elder, but now, Milton’s attitude had completely changed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This bastard…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Johannes thought Milton was trying to subdue them as the commander. And he also believed that if he was pushed here, he would continue to be dragged around by Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;“Your words are too harsh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“What do you mean&nbsp;</span><span>too</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;harsh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We led our armies to participate in this war as well. I’m saying that we’re all in an equal position. But you’re completely ignoring and looking down upon us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Equal position? Ha… you barely brought 20,000 troops and now you’re saying equal…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The atmosphere turned cold. The other commanders all heard, ‘I have no intention of respecting you,' in Milton’s words. Of course, that was Milton’s intention. He had expected they would try to quarrel with him, and he had no intentions of letting it go. Why?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘This war can’t be fought with a handicap.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Because from the very beginning, Milton didn’t view the people in front of him as a helpful force, but a burden. That’s&nbsp;</span><span>why, Milton</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had begun to antagonize them. He wanted to make these burdens say a certain sentence with their own mouths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you are going to be this dictatorial, then we cannot cooperate in this war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Perfect.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was exactly what he was looking for. Inwardly, Milton was delighted when Marquis Johannes said he could not voluntarily cooperate with this war. All he had to do now was follow the predetermined procedures step by step to achieve his goal. Milton spoke calmly to Marquis Johannes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what if you can’t cooperate in this war? What are you going to do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Johannes was speechless. Even if he said he wouldn’t cooperate, there wasn’t much he could do. If he continued to refuse to follow Milton’s orders, then he would be going against military law. And he didn’t know if Milton really would punish them according to the military laws. But he also couldn’t take the chance going against him when the military laws could be acted upon. Life was a precious thing. Then, there was only one legal option for them to fight against Milton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If we decide that the commander’s arbitrary decisions are too much for us, then we will take back our reinforcement armies and return to our native country.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Johannes took out his trump card. If there was no way to rebel within the Allied Forces, then he’ll just leave. This was the only legal way they could fight against Milton.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, Viscount Sabian had already anticipated this and told Milton how to respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do as you wish.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Marquis Forrest? Are you being serious?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am. Allies who interfere with the command structure are not helpful during war. I don’t need you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When Milton coldly told them to leave if they wished, Marquis Johannes</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and the other nobles were dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Is he serious? No, he’s probably bluffing.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘There’s no way he would…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘But what if he’s being serious?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Truthfully, it was unreasonable for them to take their military and return back to their own countries. How could they return to their countries without fighting a single battle because they had trouble with the commander? None of them wanted to leave such a serious stain on their career. In the first place, none of them were in a high position back in their own countries. Their kingdoms thought this war was a sham and sent just enough reinforcements to make a showing. Even the commanders leading their military were just mediocre.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, if they caused trouble and returned back to their country, there wasn’t anyone powerful enough to cover for them if they were questioned. No, actually, there was one person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Marquis, if we were to return to our own countries, then you’ll also be questioned by your own country.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gloucester Kingdom’s Count Josh Carbon spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton gave him a sardonic smile in response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You still don’t know where I rank in my country?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Unlike you, there’s no one in my country who would dare question me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">‘Except&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">my vixen</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;of a fiancee.’</span></p>
