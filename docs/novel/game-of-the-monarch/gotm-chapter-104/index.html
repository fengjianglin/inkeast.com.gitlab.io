 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once the banquet was over, Milton returned to his room all exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you alright, My Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You look very tired, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton gave his advisors, Viscount Sabian and Jerome, a wry smile at their question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahh… It’d be much easier to fight on the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Smiling at the meaningless bullshit he had to listen to without getting angry was more tiring and exhausting than he had expected. Milton envied Bianca who had come up with excuses to miss the banquet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I’m really not a politician.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Queen Leila was much better at this than Milton was. If it was her, she would’ve had the entire banquet in the palm of her hand doing whatever she wanted. Milton was mentally drained and all he wanted to do now was dive into his bed and pass out. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you Marquis Milton Forrest?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A man appeared in the hallway leading to his room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Damn it…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Milton greatly annoyed, Viscount Sabian coughed to signal him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Cough</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I know, alright, I know…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was someone else’s house. I cannot get angry. Why? Because the smart Viscount Sabian said not to be angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once he had convinced himself, Milton spoke with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right, I’m Milton Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other person politely bowed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Carl Thomas from Florence Principality.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Florence Principality?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, Milton hadn’t seen a representative from Florence Principality at the banquet. He had heard that the princess, who was in charge of their reinforcement forces, wasn’t feeling good and had to miss the banquet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What can I do for the representative of Florence Principality?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Marquis, the Princess wishes to see you. Would you be willing to come with me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘If she has business with me, she should’ve come here instead. Why’s she telling me to go to her? Does she think being a princess is all that?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Milton thought of a princess, he only thought of Queen Leila when she was a princess. Maybe that’s why, but he didn’t feel like he had to coddle and protect her just because she was a princess. However, the attitude of the man who had delivered the message was very polite and his vigorous spirit moved Milton’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You said you were Carl Thomas?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that’s right.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see you’re an Expert, at least an intermediate level or higher.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Milton accurately pinpointed his state, Carl looked surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have a good eye, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I guess I do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, rather than a good eye, it should be viewed as an ability.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Carl Thomas]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Knight LV. 5</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Strength — 85 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Command — 70</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Intelligence — 35 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Politics — 32</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Loyalty — 00</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Special Traits — Guarding, Fierce Combat, Fortify</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Guarding LV. 5: <span id="docs-internal-guid-a3ea7952-7fff-8d78-b045-41f6b9743566" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Overall stats increase when guarding a person you are loyal to</span></span>.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fierce Combat LV. 5: Activates in a precarious situation. Bring forth an ability up to 50% higher than normal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Fortify LV. 3: When defending a fort, increase the morale of&nbsp;</span><span>ally</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;troops and increase your ability to command.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had considerable talent. Just his Strength Stat of 85 was respectable but his special traits were also impressive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Guarding, Fierce Combat, and Fortify. The traits are a bit inconsistent, but overall, they’re not bad.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This man seemed like he’d be more useful during the war than Marquis Johanna and the others at the banquet hall. And if she had someone like him under her banner, then Princess of Florence Principality was someone Milton was interested in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, lead the way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was led to the wing where the Princess of Florence Principality was staying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is she staying here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The place he was guided to was a separate wing that was much smaller than the place Milton was staying in. It was a simple but appropriately styled wing where regular envoys stayed. But seeing how this was a Princess from another country, and she was treated the same as a regular envoy, Milton could see how low the rest of the continent viewed Florence Principality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Your Highness, I’ve brought Marquis&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, come in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Permission was granted immediately after Carl spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And when Milton entered,&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Welcome, Marquis Forrest. I am Violet&nbsp;</span><span>ron</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Florence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At a glance, the princess was a slender beauty with sparkling dark brown eyes and waist length black hair, a symbol of the Florence royal family. Her slender and delicate body type combined with her innocent features exuded a charm that stimulated a man’s protective instincts. She was slender enough that it made people worry whether she might blow away at a gust of wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton approached her, then knelt on one knee in front of her and lightly kissed the back of her hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s an honor to meet you, I am Milton Forrest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if she was a princess of a small country, he greeted her with as much courtesy as expected of her rank; he didn’t look down upon her. The princess seemed a bit flustered, but recovered quickly and smiled at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry for asking you to suddenly meet with me, but I had a request to ask of you. That’s why I asked you to come here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton thought to himself as he listened to her speaking so politely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘That’s right, this is what a princess should be like.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thanks to someone, Milton had become biased against princesses in general, but Princess Violet seemed like the perfect person to fix that prejudice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Let’s take a look at her status window… what’s this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At least, that’s what he thought until he saw her status window.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Violet ron Florence]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Knight LV. 5</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Strength — 88 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Command — 85</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Loyalty — 00</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Special Traits — Recklessness, Fierce Combat, Commando, Intuition</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Recklessness LV. 8: The ability to fight while ignoring your own injuries during battle. However, your rational judgment will be greatly reduced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fierce Combat LV. 8: Activates when you are in a precarious situation. It brings your ability up 80% higher than normal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Commando LV. 9 (MAX): Jumps into the fray against many enemies and attacks wildly. You have a high probability of breaking down the opponent’s battle lines. It can also reduce enemy morale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Intuition LV. 5: The ability to detect a critical situation for your troops in advance&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘…Huh? This is strange, is my ability broken?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why was it that when Milton used his ability on the princess, the stats on the window reminded him of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? Milton opened his eyes and checked Princess Violet’s status window again. The floating stats did not change. He looked at the princess again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Mm… nothing’s changed?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Standing in front of him was a woman who looked like she couldn’t wring a chicken’s neck, let alone fight in a war. War? It looked like she was better suited for calmly embroidering with a needle than holding a sword. But her stats felt like it belonged to a legendary Berserker. It was the first time he had seen a Commando trait that had been MAXed. Even the fearless Rick’s Commando trait was at a Level 4. And Recklessness on top of that? This was the first time Milton had seen a trait like that. The ability to fight without worrying about injuries during a battle. But your rational judgment would be greatly affected. Should traits like this be given to bloodthirsty berserkers and not a delicate and innocent princess?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘What’s up with this princess?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton knew for sure now. Even if she was a different type, this princess wasn’t a normal person either. Whether she knew what Milton was thinking or not, Princess Violet gave him a small smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You’re very famous, Marquis&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. I’ve heard a lot about you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just based on her appearance, she was a very beautiful princess, but Milton, who knew her true nature(?) was secretly burdened by her praise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t think I’m particularly famous, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Milton humbly responded, Princess Violet widened her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That can’t be. As the hero who saved the Lester Kingdom from the Republic’s invasion, what are you talking about? You’re famous even in my country, Marquis.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet’s voice had become slightly excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing her like this, Milton had a thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Now that I think about it, Florence Principality is just south of my country.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>If the Lester</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Kingdom had lost against the Republic, then it was likely that Florence Principality would have been next. So, at the time, Florence Principality had taken great interest in the war that had taken place in the Lester Kingdom. It was only natural that they would be highly interested in the hero who had rescued his country during the war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet continued to talk about Milton’s career on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was truly amazing that you decided to advance into the Hildes Republic in that situation. When I heard about it, I was overflowing with admiration for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah… is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘That was Viscount Sabian’s plan.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And weren’t you also the only person to win against Siegfried? You’re really amazing. Siegfried was the one who killed Duke Derek Brans, he’s a very powerful enemy and you fought him off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even as she was talking, her voice kept rising in excitement and her eyes kept sparking as she got closer and closer to Milton…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">A fangirl?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That’s right. She was like an extreme fangirl who was meeting her idol.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Either way, I don’t feel any hostility from her.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton was slightly flustered but he now knew that she held no hostility towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If she was acting, then she was a vixen of the same level as Queen Leila, but Princess Violet’s Intelligence Stat was 25 and her Politics only 20. Those numbers showed there was no way she could have vixen-level acting skills. And so, Milton relaxed a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet, who had been praising Milton for a very long time, finally came to her senses and got to her main point.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“But Marquis&nbsp;</span><span>Forrest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, I have a reason for asking you to meet me privately.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please, speak.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She straightened her back and looked straight at Milton.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you allow Florence Principality to take the vanguard during this war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re asking me to place you in the front?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She nodded at his question and responded with a serious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I must make a big contribution in this war. If you give me a chance, I won’t disappoint you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton thought for a moment. Seeing him, Princess Violet thought he was hesitating and quickly continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You may think I’m unreliable, but truthfully, I’m… stronger than I seem, Marquis.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet spoke hesitantly. She was doubtful whether he would believe her when she was a woman. Most men had a preconceived notion that even if a woman was strong, there was a limitation to what she could do. But…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I know. You’re an intermediate leveled, almost advanced Expert.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Milton easily acknowledged Princess Violet’s strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“……”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had never been treated like this before in her life and was rather confused by his attitude. Even with her innate talent, she had worked hard to become as strong as she was now, but most men didn’t recognize her abilities. The only ones who did acknowledge her skills were men who were beaten down and knelt before her sword on the training grounds. And of those men, half of them didn’t admit they lost to a woman. Instead, there were more who complained behind her back. But Milton had easily acknowledged her skills. Not only that, he had accurately pinpointed her skill level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘Hm… I thought I hid it?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Princess Violet was truly surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
