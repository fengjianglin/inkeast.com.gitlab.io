 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘They could be working together.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Judging by the current situation, Zich could not erase that possibility. No, it seemed very likely that they were collaborating together.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Since the assassin group’s focus is to make Demon People, Fest could be one of their creations.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was good for Zich either way. The reason why Zich had come to this village while thinking it might be a trap was because he wanted to meet the assassin group again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Just finding out that Fest and the organization are working together is already a good harvest for me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, Zich was not satisfied with just finding out this information. If he could, he wanted to get as much information as possible. However, it would be very difficult for Zich to find any more information about them considering that they were so inclined to self-destruct. But Zich was not fazed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I have to be patient when dealing with guys like this. I need to slowly gather information bit by bit and find the perfect timing.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was the extent of Zich’s thoughts. He didn’t need to think any further; moreover, Clovey’s attacks put a stop to Zich’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crash! Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected of a knight, Clovey’s movements were fast, and his attacks had great power. From what Zich knew, Clovey was the strongest among Joachim’s subordinates—no, he was one of the strongest knights in the whole Dracul estate. Compared to Zich’s younger brother, Greig, or a beginner knight like Byner, Clovey was an experienced and powerful knight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hyaaat!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich bounced off Clovey’s cleverly placed sword attacks. Since Clovey’s sword was fast and strong, Zich’s hands were becoming a bit sore. However, it was not only Clovey that Zich had to pay attention to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Slide!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if it appeared from the ground, a dagger suddenly jumped towards Zich’s side. With his elbows, Zich pushed the dagger away by hitting its hilt. Just when it seemed as if Zich had avoided one dagger, another came flying towards his side. Zich pushed that one away too, and while he was occupied with the dagger, Clovey made a giant swing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just the sound of his swing shook the air. Zich expressionlessly watched Clovey’s sword move in front of him. Since the magnitude of Clovey’s attack was large, the assassins had to take a moment to escape from his attack. Thus, when Zich evaded Clovey’s attack, the battle came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But this only lasted for a moment, and very soon, numerous opponents came running towards Zich again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘The flow of their movements is very good.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even Zich was amazed by Clovey and the assassins’ abilities to coordinate their attacks. It was even more amazing because the assassins probably received no professional training in connecting their attacks with Clovey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘The assassins look as if they were trained to coordinate their attacks, but I’m sure that they didn’t train with Clovey.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were definitely areas where Clovey and the assassin’s attacks did not flow well together. The problem was that those areas were extremely small, and it was very difficult to fight them. However, their opponent was Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Even though it’s their first time working together, it’s amazing that they can work together so well. But it’s not perfect.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were very small gaps between their attacks, but it was still a gap. Zich pierced his sword in between the openings. Clovey and the assassins tried to respond, but they ended up flinching for a second. The area that Zich pierced was the minuscule gap between their unified attack flow. After a moment of hesitation, the assassins slowed down to let Clovey block Zich’s attacks. An ordinary person would never be able to notice this slight hesitation, but this opening was enough for Zich.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!” Clovey let out a cry of pain. Since he changed his movement so drastically, he lost a bit of his balance, and Zich used that to his advantage and attacked Clovey. However, Zich’s goal was not to attack Clovey. At that moment when the assassin slowed down and Clovey drew back, Zich squished his body between them and met the assassin’s wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich swung his sword. The assassin who just slowed down tried to accelerate again, but in the process of gaining speed, the assassin ended up jumping towards Zich’s sword. This was the shining result of Zich’s battle sense honed from countless battles and life experiences.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the assassin didn’t easily back down. He had also prepared something as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The assassin reached out his hand and grabbed someone near him; at the sudden pull, the person screamed. However, the assassin paid no attention to the person’s screams and pulled his hand back. The person who the assassin grabbed was a villager.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The villagers were blackmailed by the assassins and forced to lie down in the temple, but they awkwardly stayed near the battle. They were paralyzed by the intense battle in front of them, but they also didn’t have the strength or abilities to intervene. But the assassins had a way to utilize these harmless villagers by using them as shields. For any sane person, if they saw an ordinary villager in front of them, they would hesitate for at least a moment. No matter how much they hardened their hearts, it was normal for the end of their swords to waver a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the problem was that Zich was not ‘normal,’ and he was not completely sane either. Zich slowed down his sword. Since he decided to live a kind life, he couldn’t just kill an ordinary villager. If his life was at stake, he might cut a villager without hesitation, but this was not the case. But Zich did not want to helplessly evade all the attacks directed towards him just because a villager was being used as a shield. He didn’t want to go that far, and his evasions did not help end the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Also, that bastard’s face is annoying.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich wanted to destroy the assassin’s arrogant expression which seemed to say, ‘So what are you gonna do now, huh?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Agh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>With a menacing sound, a villager’s scream echoed out. The villager quickly lost his sense of balance and fell down. The villager’s right shin was bent as if it was another joint. Zich’s kick had broken his bone. However, Zich’s attacks towards the&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were far from over.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich kicked him exactly three more times, and the villager’s limbs looked as if they all gained a few more joints.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Ahhhhh!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>All of the villager’s bones broke at once, and he</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;shrieked in pain.&nbsp;</span><span>The villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wanted to grab onto&nbsp;</span><span>his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wounds, but because the bones in&nbsp;</span><span>his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">arms were also broken, he&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">couldn’t do anything&nbsp;</span><span>else other than</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;scream. Without a care for&nbsp;</span><span>his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;struggle, Zich lifted the&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and threw&nbsp;</span><span>him</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;far away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Drop.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Zich</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;heard shrieks again.&nbsp;</span><span>B</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">lood poured out of the man’s body like rainfall</span><span>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">man’s broken&nbsp;</span><span>bones&nbsp;</span><span>protruded</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;outside his skin</span><span>, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ut Zich didn’t care. The best course of action he could take right now was to immobilize the moving meat shields and scare them away from the battlefield. It didn’t matter if the meat shields suffered injuries in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hould I make the rest of them like this as well?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich purposefully&nbsp;</span><span>said this loudly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.&nbsp;</span><span>Then h</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">e saw some of the&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;near him&nbsp;</span><span>quickly run away&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">after seeing the gruesome state of the</span><span>&nbsp;villager used as a shield</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Yet, Zich wasn’t considerate enough to care for their ‘trivial’ worries.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clovey and the assassins attacked Zich again. However, Zich didn’t counterattack. He stealthily avoided their attacks and headed towards the</span><span>&nbsp;villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Clovey screamed at the&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to fight Zich, but it was impossible. They were too demoralized from seeing what Zich was capable of doing; his cruel attacks and the screams that followed had shaken them too much. The&nbsp;</span><span>villagers&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">screamed and scattered like a herd of rabbits in front of a tiger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It will be more bothersome if they g</span><span>et</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;out of my sight.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich calmly broke another&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’s limbs and threw them far away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich shouted. Hans and Snoc</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">immediately realized that Zich was calling for them and turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take care of the meat shields like this!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich showed how he broke a</span><span>&nbsp;villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’s limbs and threw&nbsp;</span><span>them&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">far away. Like Zich, Hans and Snoc were also suffering from having to deal with the&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. They also realized that their opponents were ordinary people</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">who&nbsp;</span><span>had been</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;blackmailed. However, unlike Zich, they were struggling to harm the&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s while knowing that they were dealing with ordinary people. That was why Zich had decided to set a—not so mild— example for them to follow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘W-We have to do&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?’</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc was stunned by Zich’s cruel actions, but Hans was different. Of course, Hans wasn’t</span><span>&nbsp;happy about</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;following Zich’s orders, as his slightly raised eyebrows indicated. However, he swung his sword without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Slice!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahhhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A sword skimmed a person’s shin. Blood spilled out and cries of pain rang throughout the room. Someone who had no experience in battle couldn’t keep their composure after being sliced by a sword. The&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;bent over without&nbsp;</span><span>caring</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;if he was in&nbsp;</span><span>the middle</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of a battle or not. Hans took that moment to swing his scabbard and crush the man’s limbs. Then, he kicked the&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a distance away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike Zich, Hans had always seemed like a sensible person; but seeing him like this, Snoc became speechless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Punch!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he ground rose below Snoc and struck the assassins’ stomachs. Snoc</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had been distracted, but now he was startled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Koo!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem cried out loudly&nbsp;</span><span>on Snoc’s shoulders</span><span>;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;he was giving a warning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sorry! Thank you, Nowem!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Yeah, that’s right. I can’t just keep going back and forth. It’s better than killing them.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Following Hans and Zich, Snoc also focused on immobilizing the&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. However, even while doing that, Snoc stole furtive glances at Hans. He shook his head when he saw Hans recklessly crushing the&nbsp;</span><span>villager</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s’ limbs with his sword and scabbard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Even my senior is becoming more like Sir Zich.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At that moment</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Snoc almost became certain that he would also become like that. As Zich, Hans, and Snoc ignored the assassins and Clovey to focus their attention on the&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, the number of&nbsp;</span><span>mobile</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;decreased quickly. Of course, Zich continued to also slice some of the assassins while everything was going on. There were even some guys who shot out artifacts from time to time, but Zich evaded or intercepted their attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As expected, you have some skills</span><span>,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clovey muttered while glaring at Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My skills are definitely superior to yours. It seems like you brought those guys to make up for that, but it doesn’t look like they're helping much</span><span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Zich retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The assassins didn’t move even while Zich ridiculed them. They just stayed in their position and looked for Zich’s blindspots.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, Zich</span><span>&nbsp;spat</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;out some more words.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s at a level where it’s hard to believe you guys are here to create demons out of people, including Joachim, all over the world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you saying?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clovey scowled, but the assassins responded differently. It was&nbsp;</span><span>fleeting,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;but Zich&nbsp;</span><span>noticed&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">a slight disturbance. Even the</span><span>&nbsp;assassins</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;who had trained to suppress their emotional expressions couldn’t help but respond a little bit after having their goal completely seen through.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I’m right!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This made Zich more certain. These people were trying to make Demon People all over the world. The assassins all moved at once. Their skills didn’t improve, nor did their attacks become more dangerous, but Zich could sense that their mindset had changed; in their eyes, Zich had changed from ‘a guy they had to kill’ to ‘a guy they couldn’t fail to kill.’ However, they couldn’t kill Zich just by&nbsp;</span><span>changing</span><span>&nbsp;their</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;mindset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Slice!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Argh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Argh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Zich’s sword, the assassins lost their lives one by one. It was the same for the assassins who Hans and Snoc fought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Pop!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The assassins avoided the stalagmites shooting up from the ground, but they were traps. Ha</span><span>ns&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">expected them to avoid the attacks,&nbsp;</span><span>so he</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;swung his sword at them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>An</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;assassin groaned as the sword opened up his chest. He was among the many who&nbsp;</span><span>fell victim to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;these t</span><span>ypes of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">attacks. Some lost their heads. Although the assassin group had laid down a trap, it</span><span>&nbsp;wasn’t very effective</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;because Zich found it out in the middle. Their large&nbsp;</span><span>numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;also became useless as the&nbsp;</span><span>villagers</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;used as meat shields&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;immobilized.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Damn it!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Realizing the situation he was in, Clovey gritted his teeth.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I really didn’t want to use this…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clovey shuffled through his belongings. He hesitated for a moment, but when he saw another assassin lose his life, Clovey made</span><span>&nbsp;his final</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;decision. He took out a small bottle and drank the whole thing down in one gulp.</span></p>
