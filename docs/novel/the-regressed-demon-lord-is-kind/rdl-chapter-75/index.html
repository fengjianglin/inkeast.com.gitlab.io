 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim opened his eyes and stared at the man through the prison bars in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I don’t know how my older brother gained control over everyone in the castle, but the security must be terrible if a suspicious-looking person like you can just waltz into a high-level prison.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The man who came to see Joachim looked as suspicious as hell. In a prison cell where not even a ray of light&nbsp;</span><span>could</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;shine through, the cloaked man covered himself from top to bottom. But the man did not reply. Instead, he hung the torch on his hand to a sconce next to him. Then the man stepped one closer to the prison bars. His body was huge. Compared to Joachim who was skinny and tall, the man was extremely buff, and he was about a head taller than Joachim. However, Joachim looked straight at him without a shred of fear in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s impressive. Your eyes are not full of despair yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop saying nonsense and get to the point.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim usually addressed everyone with respect and honorifics, but he dropped his manners and spoke roughly to the man—that was how shaken Joachim’s mental state was. The man’s mysterious appearance also played a significant part.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine.” The man didn’t like talking for long. “Don’t you want to fix what has gone wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What has gone wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m talking about the current state of the Dracul family. Do you seriously think the current state of the Dracul estate is normal?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no way Joachim thought the current state of the Dracul estate was normal. The Count was bedridden, the heir was only obsessed with power and controlled his vassals like puppets. Currently, everything about the Dracul estate was going wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t say everything is going normally. But I can’t believe such a suspicious-looking guy like you is worried about the state of the Dracul estate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, I have my own reasons. So, answer my question.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then how would you fix it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cloaked man took out something from his body. In his hand, there was a marble the size of a half-closed fist. The marble was red to the core, as if it was condensed from blood. Joachim, who had hemophobia, scrunched his face. However, he didn’t move his eyes away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is called the Bloody Vessel.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It looks like an ominous object.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But the effects are potent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man who had been talking in a monotone voice so far now had a sliver of excitement in his voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Absorb this into your body, and you will be able to obtain an enormous amount of power. Then you can pay back your brother who insulted and even tried to kill you, and all his obedient followers!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim stared at the Bloody Vessel. As if the marble was calling to him, it reflected the light from the torch fire and shone temptingly. But the man was not able to get the answer he wanted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I refuse.” Joachim’s answer was firm, and he did not even hesitate. Under his cloak, the man twitched his eyebrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because I don’t believe in magical fairies that suddenly help me in my time of need. I’m too old for that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you hoping that someone will take you out of here? No matter how much you persist, your only fate is execution. Your life is over anyway. Why don’t you try trusting a magical fairy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If a fairy’s gift ends with just killing my life, I would take the chance without a single hesitation, but I don't know how it will affect the people around me.” Joachim continued, “From the first place, it’s already too strange that a fairy would give me this gift. Even in all the stories I read, no fairy is a huge, buff man covered completely in a cloak.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man looked at Joachim. No, he stared at him. At this very moment, he wanted to break into Joachim’s jail and shake some sense into Joachim. But he couldn’t do that. No, he shouldn’t do that. It was okay to fail in changing other people to Demon People, but not Joachim. In his organization, Joachim was a significant figure in their future plans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If everything was going according to plan, he would have been so angry at Biyom that he would have taken the Bloody Vessel without hesitation.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everything was going smoothly in their main headquarters, but their plans in Ospurin went awry. Nobody imagined that Joachim and his task force would stop Igram in such a short period of time. According to the initial plan, Joachim shouldn’t have been able to stop the spread of Igram. And during this time, funds and resources would stop coming from the Dracul estate; thus, Joachim would fall more and more into despair at his inability. At the same time, his anger towards Biyom would grow to an astronomical size—to a point that when someone offered him enough power to commit his revenge, he would take it without reason or additional thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘But because of that variable, everything has gone to waste!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whenever the man thought about the unknown variable, Zich, he grew irritated despite his lack of emotions. On the other hand, they had to carry out this plan without fail. His job was to lead people on the ‘right path’ when things were going amiss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you not concerned that the Dracul estate will collapse at this rate?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim did not reply. But even though his eyes were half-open, there was not a trace of hesitation in them. He looked like an ascetic that didn’t waver in front of any temptations. However, the cloaked man did not easily back down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You experienced all sorts of diseases since you were young, even diseases that have never appeared in this world and many of them at once. Didn’t you think that was strange?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course, you thought it was weird. However, even after all that, you probably didn’t think it was some sort of conspiracy against you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if lightning struck down every village in the country and burned them all down simultaneously, most people would not think it was a result of a conspiracy. The most they would do was cry out to God in anger, and the reasoning for that was simple—it was because such a natural phenomenon was impossible for humans to perform. No matter how great a person’s master plan was, there was a limit to human ability.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But what if there was a human who could control infectious diseases however they wanted?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“!!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even Joachim was shocked by this. He was about to deny that such a human could exist, but the words did not easily come out of his mouth. As soon as he thought that a human could possess such an ability, everything came into place and made sense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Was it you guys?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, not us. We are just providing some small assistance to that person.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man was happy that Joachim showed a strong reaction. However, he showed no signs of delight and tried harder to mess up Joachim’s emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was your brother who directly collaborated with that human. But really, a power-hungry dictator is a fearsome thing to behold.” The man continued, “Just to kill his younger brother, he decimated so many villages with diseases.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crunch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Joachim showed a reaction, the man felt glad; but he hid his feelings again and tried to mess up Joachim’s emotions even more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">our brother is the one who&nbsp;</span><span>joined forces with a person like that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. A powerful person’s obsession with power is truly scary</span><span>.” And the man continued,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I mean, he burned down several villages to ashes just for the sake of killing one</span><span>&nbsp;person: his own</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;younger brother.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A chilling sound rang out of Joachim’s teeth, but the man continued speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you didn’t die like he wanted, so he released the epidemic even&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Ospurin.&nbsp;</span><span>E</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ven a guy blinded by power wasn’t crazy enough to burn his capital city to the ground</span><span>, so</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;he released a weaker infectious disease such as Igram. And in the meantime, he tried&nbsp;</span><span>plotting against you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but all his plans were completely ruined by your&nbsp;</span><span>victory</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;against Igram. In the end, it seems like he decided to use all means possible and finally imprisoned you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim’s haggard-looking face looked even more drained than before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How about it?&nbsp;</span><span>Are you still not going to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">change your mind? If Biyom Dracul becomes the Count, the&nbsp;</span><span>h</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ell you experienced will continue. Since he is a pig</span><span>&nbsp;who is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">only greedy for power, the rest of the world w</span><span>ill</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;soon join&nbsp;</span><span>this h</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ell. It’s definite. Are you going to throw away your one and only chance to change reality because of some anxiety?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Didn’t you say that you helped my brother?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We worked out of necessity. It’s not like we are&nbsp;</span><span>going to be&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">collaborators forever. Besides, the period for us to work with your brother is over.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim stared at the ‘Bloody Vessel’ that the man was holding. If the man was telling him the truth, this matter would not&nbsp;</span><span>just</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;end with a power struggle for the Count’s position. The man’s words were difficult to believe, but if Joachim thought about everything he had gone through, they&nbsp;</span><span>didn’t seem so far-fetched</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man urged him on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you going to do? Take it? Or leave it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It almost seemed like a snake was darting its forked tongue at him. Joachim’s eyes shook. He thought for a moment and was about to say his decision when—</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That looks like a great item. Could you give me a chance to buy it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Flinch!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man jumped in surprise. He placed&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Bloody Vessel inside his robe and heightened his&nbsp;</span><span>senses</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>towards&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the area where he heard the voice. In the entrance, hidden by the darkness, he heard footsteps. A moment later, the owner of these footsteps entered into the torchlight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>Mr.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Zich?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim was surprised to see someone&nbsp;</span><span>he didn’t expect&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t…seem well,&nbsp;</span><span>s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ir</span><span>,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich commented cynically after seeing the state Joachim was in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How did you…?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was frustrating to see how everything was progressing, so I forced myself in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“F-Forced yourself in…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It didn’t seem like Zich had entered by normal means, and Joachim wondered if Zich had really jumped over the castle’s gates by his own might. Listening to Zich’s way of speaking, it didn’t seem like he used a peaceful method to get in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Joachim, I have a lot to say, but I will have to push my conversation with you</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">a bit later</span><span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich&nbsp;</span><span>said and looked&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">towards the robed man</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I need to speak to someone else first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Are you Zich?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, I’m Zich. Are you the leader of the assassins?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man’s demeanor, aura, and everything&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;different from the ordinary assassins Zich had seen. The only similarity he shared with the other assassins was that he wore a dark robe that stuck to his body like his own skin. The robed man didn’t deny Zich’s claims.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you are talking about the assassins who ambushed you, yes, you are right. I have greatly troubled you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are taking words out of my mouth. They dashed towards me&nbsp;</span><span>continuously</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;like moths to a fire. You should have sent more skilled ones.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A vein popped out of the man’s head, but his robe hid it. The man didn’t show his agitation and replied back flatly</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you here to save Joachim?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that someone was about to fall into a devil’s t</span><span>rap</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, so I came running</span><span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Zich said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s eyes pointed at the man’s chest—specifically, the Blood Vessel in its grasp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But, you know</span><span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I have an interest in that thing called Bloody Vessel. Could you explain it to me too?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if I tell you, you won’t know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be like that. Don’t you have compassion for me who went through all kinds of troubles because of your attacks?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t need to know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come on, just tell me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich sighed</span><span>&nbsp;after</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;seeing the man’s tightly shut mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your companions weren’t like this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…What?”&nbsp;</span><span>t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he robed man finally responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I saw guys like you at Suol. I realized it then—that you all were going around trying to corrupt people. Let me see…what should I call you guys?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich stroked his chin and looked like he had just naturally thought of something.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Should I try calling you Demon&nbsp;</span><span>Maker</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man’s eyes turned sharp, but Zich wasn’t bothered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, Demon&nbsp;</span><span>Maker</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sounds good</span><span>&nbsp;since you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;are an organization&nbsp;</span><span>that makes</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Demon People. And the person you are trying to corrupt into becoming a Demon Person is Sir Joachim over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the mention of his name, Joachim’s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think the first step of your plan was to make him absorb the Bloody Vessel.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich noticed the robed man’s hands&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">flinch</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The man looked like he wanted to fling his fist at Zich in that instan</span><span>ce</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. However, the man endured and didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tch. It’s annoying to deal with someone so unsociable. The last guy I talked to was a blabbermouth and responded to everything I said.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The last assassin leader had been someone who Zich could have some fun and ‘converse’ with, but the assassin leader in front of him right now seemed like he was a different type of person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I won’t learn much from this guy.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since things like torture didn’t work on&nbsp;</span><span>people&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">like them, Zich had to extract information from each and every word they said. Thus, Zich tried to make it his standard to talk as much as he could while fighting these assassins—especially their leaders. However, it seemed as if this man’s personality was&nbsp;</span><span>naturally reticent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, they heard noises from outside the prison.&nbsp;</span><span>It was the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sound of many footsteps.&nbsp;</span><span>As if the owners of the footsteps&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">were wearing armor,</span><span>&nbsp;Zich, Joachim, and the assassin&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">heard&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;loud, chaotic sound of iron clacking against each other. Joachim’s expression darkened while the man’s expression brightened up in contrast. Both of them thought Biyom’s troops were making their way down to the basement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, that wasn’t the case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Zich!” Hans shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have secured the surroundings around this prison.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim and the man’s faces&nbsp;</span><span>flipped</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Zich smiled widely at the man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why is your face like that?&nbsp;</span><span>As</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;you wanted, I bought you some time with useless conversations. Isn’t this what you wanted?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The robed man couldn’t find the right words to&nbsp;</span><span>say</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s obvious why a poor talker like you would grit&nbsp;</span><span>your</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;teeth and endure my provocations to let me continue. You were probably waiting for your reinforcements to arrive—are you shocked that my</span><span>&nbsp;reinforcements</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;came instead?</span><span>”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zic</span><span>h mocked as he continued,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How was that sweet moment of hope?”</span></p>
