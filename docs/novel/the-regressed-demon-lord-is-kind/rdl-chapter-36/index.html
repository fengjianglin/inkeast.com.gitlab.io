 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With firm steps, Lubella walked through the Grand Temple’s halls. Her shoulders were&nbsp;</span><span>squared</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, and there was no hesitation in her footsteps. It was hard to find any trace of her past timid self in her movements. Weig followed behind Lubella silen</span><span>tly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. It was only after Lubella put sufficient distance between herself and Windne that&nbsp;</span><span>she</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;let out a sigh of relief</span><span>.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whew~!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella let her shoulders down and loosened her body. Then, she turned around with a spin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How was I? I tried to act according to Mr. Zich’s advice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was perfect.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was so perfect that Weig became worried that Zich might have influenced her too much.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those two won’t be able to bother you anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hey weren’t on the same footing as Lubella in the&nbsp;</span><span>first place</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">; even though they were both Saint Candidates, not all Saint Candidates were equal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With firm determination, Lubella said, “That would be great. But it won’t matter to me either way. I</span><span>&nbsp;plan</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to fight back now, especially&nbsp;</span><span>if they</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;continue&nbsp;</span><span>to insult me like they did&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I still can’t believe you actually slapped her. That was Mr. Zich’s advice, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Lubella&nbsp;</span><span>confided in&nbsp;</span><span>Zich</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;about Windne’s attitude towards her, he told her to try slapping Windne. Zich told her that while it was important to always consider the situation, person, and condition in a conflict, she should slap people who&nbsp;</span><span>treated her unfairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the uncertainty&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">n her face&nbsp;</span><span>in response to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his advice, Zich told her that it would also be a good idea for her to reconsider multiple times before&nbsp;</span><span>resorting to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;violence;&nbsp;</span><span>but</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;if there was no other way to settle the conflict after&nbsp;</span><span>pondering for a long time</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Lubella should take this as a sign to use violence and slap her opponents. Lubella clicked her tongue at Zich for repeating her advice back to her in his own creative way. However, since it was from Zich, Lubella engraved his words into her heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I must say, wasn’t this your first time using violence? How are you feeling?</span><span>”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella looked down at the hand that had slapped Windne.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I feel a lot of different emotions. I feel guilty about hurting someone,&nbsp;</span><span>I regret&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">how I was not able to find a different solution, and I fear that I might become a person&nbsp;</span><span>who</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;easily&nbsp;</span><span>resort</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s to violence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was natural that Lubella felt this way. All her life, violence was kept far away from her, and she felt guilty&nbsp;</span><span>for</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;inflicting the slightest amount of violence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, despite all these complicated emotions inside her, Lubella said, “But it definitely was gratifying.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Weig burst out in laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think you are ready to go to battle as Karuwiman’s Saint.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not a Saint yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s only a matter of time. But please be careful. In order to protect people and justice, we are forced to use our powers, but we cannot be swallowed by the power. If that happens, you will not only lose your qualifications as Karuwiman’s Saint, but as a human being.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, it’s about time for the Pope’s meeting to end, so let’s go report to him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two of them headed to meet the Pope.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After making a lengthy report to the Pope, Lubella separated from Weig. Lubella’s footsteps were light as she finally headed towards her room after a long and arduous journey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hello, good afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A handsome, tall man with a well-balanced body stood in front of her. He was not a Karuwiman—the broach on his chest indicated that he was an Honorary Holy Knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see that you are an Honorary Holy Knight. As a Karuwiman, I express my thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the broach Lubella had offered to Zich before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it is my honor to be able to serve Karuwiman as an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man smiled and revealed his identity, “I am Glen Zenard. Through Priest Luce’s recommendation, I was fortunate enough to gain the title of Honorary Holy Knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, Priest Luce recommended you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uruwon Luce. He was not a High Priest yet, but he was famous for his merit and faith; there were even talks that he would become the next High Priest. As someone who was recommended by Luce, Lubella thought that he must be a trustworthy person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you do not mind me asking, are you Lady Aine Lubella, one of the few chosen to be a Saint Candidate?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. Even though I am lacking in many ways, I am fortunate to&nbsp;</span><span>have been</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;chosen as a Saint Candidate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella was not sure, but Zenard seemed a bit conflicted while looking at her. However, when she tried to peer closer, there was no such emotion on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I must have been mistaken.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no reason for Lubella to continue her conversation with Zenard. She was about to say her farewells to Zenard and go back to her room when he stopped her by saying, “Didn’t you have to go through a painful experience this time?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s because you seem very troubled.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What</span><span>?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I do?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella touched her face. She was not good at controlling her expressions, and there wasn’t anything she was particularly worried about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Am I still anxious about what happened&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the Holy Knights who tried to protect me?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But that situation had already been dealt with. She was going to lead the memorial service for them and pray for their passing. Moreover, she was going to honor their sacrifice by remembering them in her heart forever. That was the resolution Lubella&nbsp;</span><span>came up with</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If possible, would you be able to tell me about your concerns? I might be able to be of some help.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His face was pure and completely devoid of all self-interest, but she shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it’s fine. I’m thankful for your offer, but I have no concerns.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>I</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if he was sorry, Zenard withdrew his body back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lady Lubella, I apologize. I must have been wrong. But my desire to help you is sincere, so if you have any concerns later, please come and find me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are a very kind and thoughtful person. I can see why Priest Luce recommended you. I will keep your words in mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After giving a small bow to Zenard, Lubella kept on moving towards her room. Even as she was walking away, Zenard did not erase the smile from his face. However, as soon as Lubella&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">completely disappeared from his sight, his expression immediately turned stiff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…There's been a change.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if his kind and gentle demeanor had all been an act, his face looked very twisted and cold. After looking&nbsp;</span><span>in the direction</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Lubella disappeared&nbsp;</span><span>off to for</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a long time, Zenard turned back and vanished into the darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the largest mining city, Suol produced more than 50% of the iron consumed by the Kingdom. The miners added vitality to the city as they moved towards the mining area at the crack of dawn. With a single lantern and a pickaxe, the miners had to dig in a dirty and dark cave. It was a dangerous situation for the miners, but because of the harsh conditions, there were many excellent and fierce veteran miners.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most people in Suol did work related to mining, but not everyone was a miner.&nbsp;</span><span>O</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ne job unrelated to mining was</span><span>&nbsp;being a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Monster Exterminator. It was not an exaggeration to say that in this world, every place was threatened by monsters in one way or another. There were differences in severity between different areas, but even the capital city of the Kingdom had to deal with monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, it was also crucial for the Kingdom to have a stable supply of iron. For this reason, the Kingdom made it their top priority to carry out large-scale monster sweeps around Suol at least twice a year.&nbsp;</span><span>Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Suol was safer than most villages and towns from monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this was all&nbsp;</span><span>i</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">n relative terms; even Suol was not completely safe from monster attacks. As long as monsters existed in this world, no city or village was completely safe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To make up for this gap in protection, the Kingdom set up a complementary system, which was to&nbsp;</span><span>find</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;monster exterminators. It was a straightforward system that gave a set amount of money to those who caught monsters. Despite its simplicity, it was a somewhat effective solution. It was nowhere near the effectiveness of the Kingdom’s large-scale monster sweeps, but it helped curb the number of monsters till the next monster sweeping season. Moreover, this system was much cheaper than mo</span><span>bilizing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;an entire army. It was also a good way for skilled fighters to make money.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Thus</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, many different types of people became monster exterminators. Some people were retired mercenary soldiers, some were adventurers seeking to raise money for their journeys, and some were farmers looking for ways to pay their debts. As long as they could fight monsters, there were no limitations to becoming a&nbsp;</span><span>m</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">onster&nbsp;</span><span>e</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">xterminator.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While leaning against a tree and sitting on a thick tree root, Zich said, “So it’s really the best possible job for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Hans, the only one who could hear him,&nbsp;</span><span>did not have the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;leisure to even reply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kweckkkkk!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc screamed and swung his rusty&nbsp;</span><span>ax</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;around. The awful smell coming from the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc&nbsp;</span><span>assaulted&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans’&nbsp;</span><span>nose</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. However, Hans did not lose his focus on the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s movements. If Hans got hit even once by the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s&nbsp;</span><span>ax</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, which was moving around with no sense of direction or logic but by pure brute force, he would be fatally injured.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Orghhhh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc jumped towards Hans. While holding a half-rotten handle, the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc swung his&nbsp;</span><span>ax</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with all his strength to split Hans into two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">had been quietly observing the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc</span><span>&nbsp;before he</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;jumped into action. He moved his feet widely and raised his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘No matter how much strength and mana training I’ve been doing, I’m still just a beginner.

Instead, I have to block their attacks by softly deflecting and letting the rest of the force flow out.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans remembered Zich’s advice. The harsh&nbsp;</span><span>training he</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;went through and all his past experiences allowed his body to move according to Zich’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Zing!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A rusty ax and a short sword met in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans cried in pain from the force of the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s powerful swing.

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Screeeech!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s ax began to slide past the tilted sword, and the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s body began to fall forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huuuuup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans made a loud yell and&nbsp;</span><span>flexed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his forearms. He put his foot forward and moved one step next to the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s side. Then, as if the sword was brushing past the ax, he slid the sword to the side and pushed the ax away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With nothing blocking his path anymore, Hans made an excellent half-circle and pierced the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Puck!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans was only able to cut half of the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s hard neck, but he was now used to these types of situations. He quickly moved his body to the side and moved his sword back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Swing!</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A human being would have fallen into a state of panic after having their neck&nbsp;</span><span>sliced&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">halfway, but these&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc</span><span>s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;swung their axes nonstop without a care in the world. Before he knew what they were like, there were a few times Hans almost died.

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Glurg!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Blood spurted out of the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s neck.

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans almost peed his pants seeing how the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc held his half flapping, severely bleeding neck with one hand and an ax with the other hand; but even the toughest&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc could not go for long in this condition.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To make sure, Hans pierced the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s head.

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you finally done?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if he was bored, Zich let out a yawn. Even though Zich’s behavior was beyond annoying, Hans could not say anything. Zich was the scariest of them all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes</span><span>,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans replied with no strength in his voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich got up and walked lazily towards the&nbsp;</span><span>o</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rc’s dead body.

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The words that Hans had been waiting for finally came out of Zich’s mouth.</span></p>
