 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella’s voice shook as she called out Zich’s name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her appearance was still blindingly beautiful. However, she looked completely different from a few days ago. Her shining blond hair was gr</span><span>a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">y from dust, and her clean skin was now covered in dirt and mud. Her clothes, which made her look divine before, were ripped and dirtied now, making them look no better than a beggar’s clothes. Her current appearance did not indicate that she was a priestess of Karuwiman in any way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You look wretched.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With Zich’s words, Lubella bit her lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She slowly got up and handed something to Zich. It was a white staff with a semi-transparent blue jewel. It was probably a tool that helped increase divinity, but like its owner, the staff was also dirty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Judging by your reaction, you must also know that you are wanted right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>H</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ow were you able to find me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m confident in my senses. I felt a similar presence&nbsp;</span><span>like yours</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Lady Lubella, shivering inside this alleyway, so I came to check.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich was incredible at detection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans and even Lubella were shocked. Hans looked at Zich as if he was a monster. On the other hand, Lubella quickly calmed her emotions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you going to turn me in?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no strength in her voice, but the light in her eyes indicated that she would not be dragged out without a fight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will you believe me if I say I wouldn’t?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella was not able to reply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A quiet tension passed between them and then suddenly—</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Growwl!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A huge sound rang out from Lubella’s stomach. Because no one was speaking, the sound from Lubella’s stomach sounded&nbsp;</span><span>like rolling thunder</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Lubella’s cheeks began to flush.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>L</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">et’s eat first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella didn’t say anything for a few moments, but eventually, she nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Zich decided to bring Lubella with them, it still didn’t change the fact that she was a wanted person charged with serious crimes such as the ‘assassination of the&nbsp;</span><span>D</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">eputy&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor’ and ‘casting a Great Curse on Porti.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich ordered Hans to go back before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans looked back&nbsp;</span><span>and forth</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;between Lubella and Zich with worry in his eyes, but soon, he left while carrying a torch. The two waited for a few more minutes to pass by, and silence passed between them before Lubella&nbsp;</span><span>commented,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ou are not asking me anything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m going to ask</span><span>, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ut only after we get out of this situation first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich lifted his head and stared at the sky. Fortunately, the moon and stars were covered by clouds like the past few days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s start moving.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Already? Isn’t it better for us to wait a bit more?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s okay because there’s not a lot of people walking around at night these days. It’s all thanks to ‘Witch&nbsp;</span><span>Aine&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella.’”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella glared at Zich, and he shrugged in reply. They carefully tr</span><span>od</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;out of the alleyway. Lubella nervously checked the surrounding area for people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I can’t see anything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The city was so dark that it was impossible to perceive even nearby objects. In this situation, it was difficult to see the way to their destination, and it was easy to receive a lot of injuries from&nbsp;</span><span>bumping into</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;buildings or random objects. Normally, Lubella would have just used her holy powers to support her eyesight, but she didn’t have enough energy from starving and lacking sleep for the past few days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Grab!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">omething suddenly grabbed Lubella’s hand. It&nbsp;</span><span>was rough</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and large, but it was a warm hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will do most of the guiding. Please be careful while following me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella quietly looked at Zich’s hand and replied</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>Alright</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich focused his mana on his eyes. With this control, the completely opaque view in front of him became visible. Zich began to lead Lubella towards their destination. Fortunately, the wind was blowing strong</span><span>ly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, so they did not have to watch their footsteps. However, because Lubella was basically blind, her footsteps were slow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you focus your mana on your eyes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You know about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have seen the Holy Knights use a similar skill.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With this statement, Lubella closed her mouth again. She probably was thinking about the Holy Knights who&nbsp;</span><span>had protected</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;her. Judging by her reaction, they probably weren’t in a good situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘They are probably all dead.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich also didn’t say anything and silently guided Lubella.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shh!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich whispered to&nbsp;</span><span>Lubella</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella instinctively put her hands over her mouth, and Zich carefully moved while leading her. After they went around the alleyway a few times, they stuck closely towards the wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clank! Clank! Clank!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella’s eyes widened at the sound of&nbsp;</span><span>rattling metal</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. It was probably one of the city’s security guards. From a distance, faint lights brightened up the alleyway. The lights felt like flashlights searching for her whereabouts, so Lubella cautiously moved one step a time to an area far away from the light.&nbsp;</span><span>The bright</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;light began to dim as&nbsp;</span><span>she slowly moved away</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The sound of clinking metal also&nbsp;</span><span>faded</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Phew</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When all the lights and sounds disappeared, Lubella&nbsp;</span><span>let out a sigh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of relief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich grabbed Lubella and began leading her again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The place they&nbsp;</span><span>arrived at</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was Zich’s lodging. From the inside, a faint light was seeping out, and Zich could feel the presence of someone on the first floor. This meant that they couldn’t use the front door, and Zich looked around the building.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich and Hans’ lodging were on the 3rd floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Over there</span><span>,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich whispered as he saw a closed wooden window on the 3rd floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After telling Lubella this, Zich threw a small stone he found on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a few moments, the window opened and Hans appeared in view.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please hold on tightly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich ignored Lubella’s question and lifted her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kyaa!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella let out a quiet scream, but she tightly&nbsp;</span><span>held Zich's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;neck. In this state, Zich began to walk towards the building’s walls. Then he shifted his mana into his legs and put force into&nbsp;</span><span>them</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Zoom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It all happened in a moment. With ease, Zich jumped to the 3rd floor. From across the window, Zich saw Hans’ surprised face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Bang</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While holding the windowsill, Zich pushed himself and Lubella inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are both of you alright?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m alright</span><span>,”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich replied to Hans’ concerning question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I-I’m also alright.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling a bit more relieved now, Lubella replied a little bit more comfortably.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans also felt relieved after hearing both of their replies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s good to hear. For now, please sit down comforta…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans could not finish his sentence because he was startled by the ferociousness in Lubella’s eyes. Her eyes were almost mad. Fortunately, she was not staring at Hans, but a bowl of food placed on a small table in the corner of the room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hah! I guess it can’t be helped if the Holy Priestess of Karuwiman is hungry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? N-no, this is…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella blushed bright red and began making excuses. Then, she closed her mouth and began twisting her body. Zich thought she seemed embarrassed by her behavior, but even then, Lubella could not stop stealing glances at the food. As a final blow, Lubella’s stomach let out another&nbsp;</span><span>growl</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;again, and she collapsed onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You should eat it. We prepared the food for you anyways. You must have had no time to eat while being on the run.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if she wanted to refuse, her stomach was so famished that it almost felt hollow. While shaking, Lubella moved towards the food.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I will be leaving again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Where</span><span>&nbsp;are you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;going?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans asked Zich who was already halfway outside the window.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just in case, I should leave an alibi by going through the front entrance. I have to make the store owner and other people think I came into the room by myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich put both of his feet outside the window and then turned his head back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When I jump down, make sure to close the window.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With these words, Zich jumped out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After making sure&nbsp;</span><span>that the&nbsp;</span><span>store owner saw him</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Zich walked up to his room as if nothing was going on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Knock! Knock!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After knocking on the door and speaking, the door&nbsp;</span><span>crac</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ked&nbsp;</span><span>open</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Hans made sure the person was Zich, then he opened the door fully. The first thing Zich’s eyes landed on was Lubella, who was eating. Nothing much&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;prepared for her—a simple soup, bread, and a few vegetables. But Lubella ate as if she was eating the tastiest food in the world, and&nbsp;</span><span>after</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a few moments, the food quickly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Scrape!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella&nbsp;</span><span>pu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">t her spoon down only after scraping the very bottom of her soup bowl. She&nbsp;</span><span>let out</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a small burp and quickly closed her mouth. Hans looked as if his ideal fantasy or whatever else was shattered, but Zich ignored him and walked towards Lubella.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then can you tell me what happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Before that, can you tell me about the rumors that are spreading about me in the city?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not hard for me to tell you. In the city, rumors that you assassinated the Deputy&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor and cast a curse on Portia have spread. There’s even a well-drawn wanted poster of you. Do you want to see it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From his clothes, Zich took out a piece of paper. Lubella took the wanted poster and glared at it as if she was going to rip it apart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>W</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">here did you get this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I got it because I thought you might be curious</span><span>&nbsp;about your portrait</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to understand Zich’s state of mind. Hans shook his head at Zich’s remarks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella put force into her hands so that the edges of the wanted poster crinkled under her hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not true.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella quietly murmured</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not a witch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s first hear what happened to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich sat on the chair opposite of Lubella and folded his arms. Lubella slowly&nbsp;</span><span>started speaking</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“After hearing what happened to Sude in the store, we went to the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor right away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Random people could not meet the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor, but a Karuwiman priestess was not a ‘random person.</span><span>’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;She could obviously meet the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor&nbsp;</span><span>if she had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a concern. Like the rumors said, one cou</span><span>ld tell that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor looked greedy with just a glance. The&nbsp;</span><span>fat&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">under his face made it difficult to decipher the position of his neck, and his beady eyes fervently moved around as if he was trying to sniff out money.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, his&nbsp;</span><span>D</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">eputy&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor looked more suitable. His half-white hair was stylishly pushed back, and his fit body indicated that he was excellent at self-management. Under his sharp eyebrows, his all-knowing eyes seemed to be able to see through anything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We said our complaints based on the words from Mr. Sude. We told him that in this city, an illegal and immoral seizing was going on. We also said that&nbsp;</span><span>someone in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor’s family was involved in this, and that there are also suspicions that the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor himself received some bribes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella also included that the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor was very taken back by her statements. However, the Deputy&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor didn’t outrightly show it and seemed to look at the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor with disdain. Fortunately, no matter how greedy the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor was, he wasn’t able to ignore a warning from a high-ranking follower of Karuwiman. The&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor replied that he would quickly begin an investigation and try to remedy this problem. However, he strongly denied the claims about receiving bribes from anyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was very difficult to trust him, but since he said he would&nbsp;</span><span>fix</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;this problem right away, Lubella had no choice but to step back. Lubella and her guards decided to go back to their lodgings for now and watch how the situation would unfold, but the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor stopped them in their tracks. He formally invited them to his home during the duration of their stay in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“During that time, I thought he just wanted to be on the good side of Karuwiman and the&nbsp;</span><span>C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hurch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a moment of pondering, Lubella accepted the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor’s invitation. The purpose of this trip was to see&nbsp;</span><span>the livelihood of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">different types of people and listen to a diverse range of viewpoints. So far, she had spent most of her time listening to the poor, the commoners, or people from the lower class; so, she thought this could be an excellent chance to listen to the upper</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">class people. Moreover, she could also spy on the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor’s actions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>Just like that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, we ended up staying in the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor’s mansion for two days. Nothing much happened during this time. However, weird stories began to surface.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shine in her eyes sharpened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The undead were beginning to appear in the city.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a follower of the divine god Karuna, the undead w</span><span>ere</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;an existence that they could not tolerate. As soon as she heard about the undead, she went straight to the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor. She still felt uncomfortable around the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor and thought poorly of him, but this was no time for personal feelings. Lubella and the Holy Knights told him that they would help patrol the city, protect the citizens, and expel the undead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor agreed to our request. He actually welcomed our involvement and told us that he would assign a section for us to patrol. Then, he told us to come to his room around sunset.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking back, his actions were suspicious. She should have known then.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>W</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">e were weaponless because it would have been a display of hostility to the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor while we were staying at his mansion. But that was actually a trap.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they went to his room at the agreed time, they saw the Deputy&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor on the floor and the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ayor holding a strange book in his hands. And from nowhere, a group of undead began to besiege them.</span></p>
