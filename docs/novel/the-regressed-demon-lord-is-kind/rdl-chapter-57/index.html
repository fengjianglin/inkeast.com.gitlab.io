 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich led Hans and Snoc quickly down the mountain. His movements were rough, but both Hans and Snoc didn’t express any complaints. It was because the dark smoke that came out of the small village looked alarmingly dangerous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Is it a raid? Or is it a simple fire?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because it came from far away, Zich couldn’t identify the specific source until they arrived at the village. However, he was sure that something abnormal was happening.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘There’s a high chance that I could do a kind act.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Zich had decided to beat bad guys to death to fulfill his goal, that wasn’t his only plan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their speed was so fast that it was hard to believe that they were running through a mountain course full of trees and bushes, but because the place was a great distance away, they arrived at the village a significant time later. Yet, the incident seemed to be on-going as the black smoke continued to rise. As they came closer and closer to the village, they saw the smoke with increasing clarity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nervousness flashed across Hans and Snoc’s faces. Hans placed his hand on his sword’s handle while Snoc hugged Nowem.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Sniff! Sniff!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s nose twitched. As they neared the village, a smoky smell wafted through the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is…the smell of burning corpses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans and Snoc heightened their guard. The smell of burning corpses—it didn’t sound pleasant at all. After leaving the forests’ tree-covered boundary, they saw the city’s appearance in full view. They saw the wooden fences first, which were set up to defend the area, and the black smoke seeped through them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Perhaps bandits or foreign enemies ambushed them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans already had half his sword pulled out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I don’t think that’s the case.” Zich studied the wooden fence. “The fence around the village is too fine for it to be an ambush. And if the bandits caused the fire, they wouldn’t just let the smoke pour out. They would be waving fire around. There’s a strong possibility that the village could have been burned down to ashes, but the view of the village I saw from the top of the mountain looked normal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three walked along the wooden fence and saw a door. The door was firmly closed, and two soldiers with spears stood in front of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘They are not gatekeepers who are there to protect the village.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For that to be the case, they were too heavily armored.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the soldiers noticed Zich and his companions. The soldier’s eyes became menacing, and he lifted the spear he was holding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How did you get out of the village!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other soldier also saw Zich’s party and similarly reached out with his spear. Hans and Snoc stuttered in shock, but Zich took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We are travelers. We came to stay the night in the village.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What nonsense! All pathways to this village are blocked!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It was?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering the soldier’s aggressive voice, it didn’t seem like he was lying. However, they came in a straight line through the mountain instead of following any paths, so they weren’t aware that all the paths were blocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We didn’t follow a path and went through the mountain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You went through a mountain full of monsters?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldier’s suspicions deepened. In response, Zich shrugged his shoulders and tapped on the sword at his waist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We are not so weak to be beaten by low-level monsters around this area.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Still, there’s no reason for you to go through the mountain. Following a path is much more convenient.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That would be the case if I didn’t have to train the guys behind me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even with Zich’s explanation, the soldiers didn’t let down their guard. They were extremely cautious, and it probably had something to do with the black smoke coming from inside the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there something going on in the village?” Zich looked over the wooden fence and asked, but the soldiers didn’t answer him. They grouped together and murmured about something. However, Zich was able to hear everything with his keen senses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is he telling the truth?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not sure. Since they are armed, it might be true. We can’t rule out the possibility that they might have escaped the village too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What else can we do? Let's take them to our boss first. We can’t just let them go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldier who noticed them first stared at them with dreary and slightly fearful eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They could also be infected with the disease.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Disease?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he heard that, Zich was able to grasp the village’s general situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It seems like there’s an epidemic going around here.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The black smoke probably came from burning infected corpses and their houses and belongings; and the village was probably blocked so that the infectious disease would not spread to another village. In a way, this was a trickier and more dangerous problem than a bandit or foreign attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Follow me for now,” the soldier placed his spear down and commanded. It looked like he wasn’t going to accept any form of counterargument or defiance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans asked Zich, “What are your plans, sir?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans was surprised to be treated like a criminal so abruptly, but in comparison to how he was at the beginning of the journey, he was much calmer and composed than before. He had now accumulated all kinds of experiences— quite extraordinary ones at that. On the other hand, Snoc still lacked experience, and he looked bewildered and even a bit scared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s follow them for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three followed the soldiers. The soldiers didn’t guide them inside the village—no, they almost seemed like they wanted to go farther away from the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I guess it can’t be helped if an epidemic is spreading.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If it was severe enough, an epidemic was something that could wipe out an entire country. And the horrors of an infectious disease increased as the fatality and infectious rates increased. Judging by the soldier’s wariness and response towards Zich and his companions, it seemed as if the disease that was spreading in the village had a considerably high fatality rate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers took them to an area where there were huge barracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s the command post.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering that all the paths leading to the village were blocked and trained soldiers were stationed in front of the village’s entrance, it was evident that the control tower in the center was still functioning. To lower their chances of catching the disease, it seemed like the soldiers had stationed their command post a good distance away from the village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers took them to the largest barrack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldier guarding the barrack asked this out loud. The soldiers who brought Zich to the place responded politely, indicating that the soldier in front of them was his superior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We found some suspicious fellows and brought them here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Suspicious fellows?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The superior took a quick glance at Zich and his companions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They suddenly appeared in front of the village’s entrance. According to them, they went through the mountain and didn’t know about the blocked paths.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The mountain? Why?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They said it was for training.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The superior’s eyes landed on Zich’s group for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are they villagers?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They don’t seem to be, but we are not certain. So, we brought them to you, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Suddenly, t</span><span>hey heard a voice from inside the barrack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bring them in, please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The superior stared at the entrance and looked at Zich again. Then he nodded at the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take them in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich and his companions followed the soldiers and went inside. The inside of the barrack was quite cozy; there was a bed in a corner for sleeping and a desk in another corner for doing work. There wasn’t any other furniture besides that, so it almost felt like the resident was wasting the tent’s huge space.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Thump!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldier guarding the tent raised his spear and saluted in front of the desk. A man was sitting there. He looked quite young, looking like he was only two or three years older than Zich at most. His cheeks were hollow while the areas under his eyes were so sunken that his cheekbones looked more pronounced. Overall, his health looked very poor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man stood up. He was tall but thin, which added to his gaunt, frail-looking image. However, his sparkling eyes clearly showed that he had a keen sense of intelligence, contrary to his frail and sickly appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hello, I am Joachim Dracul. I’m the person in charge of the task force dispatched in this village.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim Dracul. He was someone Zich knew and more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘To think that I would meet him so early on...’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim was one of Zich’s four closest confidants who he immediately sought out. Zich couldn’t help but feel glad to see him. Joachim had stirred up the world and gone through all kinds of happenings with Zich. How sad Zich was when he heard that Joachim’s life was cut short under Glen Zenard’s sword! Zich wanted to wrap his shoulders around Joachim, talk about their past and future—of course, of stories that reek of blood—and clink their wine glasses. However, in this world, this was Joachim’s first meeting with Zich, and Zich had to repress his joy at seeing an old friend.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Zich. The guys behind me are my servants, Hans and Snoc.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see, Mr. Zich. I know how impolite it is to interrogate someone I just met, but considering the circumstances, I ask for your understanding. Where are all three of you coming from?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim’s voice was sharp, and the soldier gripped his spear more tightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We are on our way from Suol. Like I told the soldier here, since I was traveling through the mountain to train my servants, I didn’t realize that the paths to the village were blocked.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim made eye contact with Zich as if he was trying to see through the truth, but Zich showed no change in his facial expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand. I will believe you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir!” the soldier shouted. “They might be guys escaping from the village in secret! If that’s the case...!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please calm down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim raised his sword and blocked the soldier’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not just blindly trusting these people’s words. To be frank, it doesn’t matter what these men’s identities are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim stared at Zich, Hans, and Snoc in order and opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since wherever they are from, I don’t plan on letting them out of here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? What do you mean…!” Hans shouted in surprise and closed his mouth. When Joachim looked at him, Hans’ mouth closed shut by itself. Although Joachim looked frail, he exuded a mystical aura and suffocated Hans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Amazing. He has this much charisma already?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich was impressed. Joachim deserved to be his sidekick for sure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know this is a lot to ask, but as long as you are in this village, you will have to move with us. Here—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s an epidemic spreading around.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich finished Joachim’s sentence. Both Hans and Snoc looked stunned, and Joachim’s face was filled with a slight look of surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You were aware of it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Blocked roadways, a barricaded village, and the smoke coming out of the village. In addition, army troops from the central government disguised as a task force. There were many clues.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That is true. You are right. An epidemic is spreading around the village, and our troops were dispatched to retain it. Since you made contact with us, all of you could be infected too, so we can’t let you go back outside.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich nodded obediently, and Hans felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Even Sir Zich would accept a reason like an epidemic.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering Zich’s personality, Hans had been nervous that Zich would refuse confinement; he was almost worried about Zich’s response more than the epidemic. However, Hans didn’t realize that Zich was more agreeable than usual because he was glad to meet one of his four subordinates from his past.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you like, we can help with the work here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans also had no idea that this was also the reason for Zich’s overly kind behavior. &nbsp;</span></p>
