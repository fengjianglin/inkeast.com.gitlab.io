 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella felt as if the sky was collapsing on top of her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>She</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;almost fell from suddenly losing strength in her legs. She could barely maintain her balance, and she couldn’t stop her body from shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why? But wasn’t the ritual’s strength definitely weakening? And weren’t the numbers of the&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead also decreasing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, that’s because I&nbsp;</span><span>manipulated the surroundings to make it appear that way</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. I wanted to trick you guys into thinking that the ritual was weakening. How&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;it? Didn’t I do a good job?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You c-controlled it&nbsp;</span><span>in that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I was in control the whole time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim winked at Lubella.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When the ritual is finished, I can control the&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead without limits. I thought pretty hard about how I could convince you both that the ritual was slowly weakening. In a way, this might be my life’s masterpiece. Seeing how both of you have been tricked so thoroughly, I’m beyond delighted by how well everything&nbsp;</span><span>has</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;turned out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Snap!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim snapped his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">omething under the lake began to&nbsp;</span><span>come</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;out in bursts.&nbsp;</span><span>Soon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">,&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead creatures and monsters spread out all over the place and began&nbsp;</span><span>to surround</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Zich and Lubella. All of them were powerful, high-level&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead creatures and monsters. Lubella could</span><span>n’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">t even react in shock and helplessly watched the&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead creatures and monsters surround her and Zich. Her mouth moved, but no sound came out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you can see, I can summon the&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead and monsters with no problems.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The&nbsp;</span><span>u</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ndead creatures and monsters began to advance past the surrounding areas, and Lubella shouted in shock</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you going to attack the citizens…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, you don’t have to worry. I’m not planning to do that just yet. I’m just sending them further off to expand the surrounding areas. I’m being extra cautious because both of you escaped from me last time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim scratched his chin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But if you guys try to resist, I might become so surprised that my minions might become</span><span>&nbsp;too&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">excited.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he said this, they heard shouts and screams</span><span>&nbsp;of people&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">surprised to see the</span><span>&nbsp;undead</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;creatures and monsters. However, it seemed like Grotim was telling them the truth. For now, the</span><span>&nbsp;undead</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;creatures and monsters were really just acting as guards to surround them. Lubella breathed a sigh of relief</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">seeing that there was no human casualt</span><span>y</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;so far; however, she knew the situation could change at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>L</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ooking at the numerous monsters and</span><span>&nbsp;undead</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;creatures all around her, Lubella shifted her attention back to Zich. While holding his sword, Zich was on guard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>W</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hat happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You told me that what we did would successfully weaken the ritual!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, I think I can reply to that question.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim intervened and began talking</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From my&nbsp;</span><span>investigation</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, it seems like you tried to interrupt the ritual by drawing weird pictures on the statues. You thought the life force embedded into the statue&nbsp;</span><span>went&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">directly underwater, and the central statue over there&nbsp;</span><span>controlled&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">everything. That man next to you spouted nonsense that&nbsp;</span><span>the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ritual could be reversed. But as&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;faithful follower of the great Bellu, I can assure you that there is no way to stop the ritual!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim’s words completely shattered Lubella’s hopes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, did he also say that he knew how to return people’s life force to their original bodies? As a Karuwiman, you should have known that it’s impossible. I can’t believe you believed in that man’s ridiculous words.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">According to&nbsp;</span><span>Grotim</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, it was impossible to heal Timmy’s younger brother. Lubella grew despondent while thinking of the child’s skeletal body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When I first saw those ridiculous drawings on the statues, I had a very good laugh. Did you seriously think that those drawings could be a magic circle? You are much too naïve. Or did you desperately cling to the only solution in front of you</span><span>&nbsp;w</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hile turning away from reality? If th</span><span>at</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;is what happened, I pity you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">soooo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;much. Well, I guess even if it sounded like a joke, you must have wanted to believe in that man’s words.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim gave Zich a look of complete reassurance over his victory. On the other hand, Zich did not respond to him at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hen, are you saying that you can carry out the ritual right now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. Everything is ready.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then why did you even waste your time, tricking us into thinking that we were successfully interrupting the ritual!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s because of you</span><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aine Lubella.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>B</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ecause of me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Karuwiman Saint&nbsp;</span><span>C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">andidate. You are a satisfactory—no, an extraordinary spoil from this master plan. How can I stand still when such a prized possession is in front of me? I have to take you aside and put you in our order.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim crossed his arms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When you first came to the Mayor’s mansion, I was actually over</span><span>joyed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. I thought Bellu’s will was gracing upon me. But as expected of a vile follower of&nbsp;</span><span>the&nbsp;</span><span>G</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">od Karuna, you managed to escape from my hands.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the first time, his voice expressed clear displeasure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When I first tried to capture you, I failed because of the Holy Knights. The second time, I failed because that punk next to you damaged the&nbsp;</span><span>K</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ey. Honestly, when that man next to you said that he would escape right in front of me, I felt all the energy in my body leave because I thought I would never&nbsp;</span><span>have another chance</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to catch you again. But then, he said a very funny thing afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At that time, Zich’s words</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>had sounded very foolish to Grotim</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but&nbsp;</span><span>they</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;made him feel hopeful again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He said that he knew how to interrupt the ritual and&nbsp;</span><span>that you’d</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;come back&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;destroy the main statue.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Zich said this, Grotim’s head filled with hope again</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">as he thought that he had another chance to capture Lubella.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I planned so that both of you w</span><span>ould</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;think that you were successfully blocking the ritual and appear in front of me again. Was it not strange? Wasn’t it odd finding the statues so easily when both of you had no idea where they were?</span><span>”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella also thought it was strange. She had quelled down her suspicions by thinking that it was because of how great Zich’s abilities were. But thinking back on it, they found the statues too quickly in such a short amount of time with no clue about their locations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In order for you to find the statues easily, I employed many soldiers to guard them. Without knowing that I was leading you on, you did a good job falling right into my trap.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hen you had no plans to stop us in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>Even if I had ordered my soldiers to capture you, they wouldn’t have been able to find you anyways.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;And why would I have to do such a useless&nbsp;</span><span>thing when you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;two will appear in front of me&nbsp;</span><span>at the time&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I want you to&nbsp;</span><span>do</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? That’s why I even purposely posted a sloppy drawing of that man so that you two could have an easier time moving around.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was like they had been</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;playing in the palm of his hands the whole time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But don’t&nbsp;</span><span>get</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;too disappointed. Because of you, I didn’t employ the ritual right away, and you were able to extend the li</span><span>ves</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of Porti’s citizens for a few more days. With this, you have done your share.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What would have happened if we&nbsp;</span><span>hadn't</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;come to you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then it couldn’t have been helped. I would have</span><span>&nbsp;started&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the ritual even though you might be swept into it. We&nbsp;</span><span>we</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">re also in a time crunch. We have to finish everything before the Kingdom or Karuwiman begins to interfere with our plans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim made a giant smile after he finished talking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did I satisfy your curiosity? I wanted you to come back here because I’m about&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;execute the ritual. I can’t let you&nbsp;</span><span>get</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;swept up&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;it after all the work I put in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s why you destroyed the building because it doesn’t matter anymore if you are caught.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. It doesn’t matter anyway because everyone in Porti will become our faithful soldiers</span><span>&nbsp;soon.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;We don’t have to try anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella closed her eyes for a moment. All sorts of emotions and regrets&nbsp;</span><span>stirred in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;her mind. However, when she opened her eyes again, Grotim was impressed by the look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Should I have expected this from a Karuwiman Saint&nbsp;</span><span>C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">andidate? In that short amount of time, you calmed yourself down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s from all the surprises you planned for me. Thanks to you, I think I was able to maximize my experiences, which was the purpose of this trip.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No matter how many experiences&nbsp;</span><span>they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">gain, there are a lot of folks who never grow mentally or physically. You cert</span><span>ainly&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">might have been the next Saint. It’s really all the better for us.&nbsp;</span><span>All y</span><span>our work</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>has</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;been meaningless.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You never know until the end.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella brought out her staff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim looked at her with mockery.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I salute your bravery. I threatened you with the citizen’s lives a moment ago, but I’m not going to hold them hostage. They are all going to be talents for our army anyways. But&nbsp;</span><span>you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>can</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;try your best</span><span>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Snap!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim snapped his fingers a second time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Thud!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The</span><span>&nbsp;undead</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;creatures and monsters began to move in unison towards Lubella and Zich. Their combined force was alarming, and Lubella found herself taking a step back despite&nbsp;</span><span>her&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">firm resolution.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mr. Zich.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich hadn’t spoken a single word since their first encounter with Grotim. Lubella thought it was because Zich&nbsp;</span><span>felt</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;guilty about causing them more danger unintentionally. However, Lubella did not blame Zich at all. Even though she would probably have to face horrible&nbsp;</span><span>pain</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;after she was captured, she wanted to say this to Z</span><span>ich</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t blame you at all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even in this dangerous situation, she smiled at Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Instead, I am thankful to you. Even though the results ended up being like this, it doesn’t change the fact that you kept trying to help me. No, if you weren’t here, my life might have ended in that dirty alleyway where you found me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What a touching sight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim sneered at Lubella’s words, but Lubella completely ignored him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even though it was a little clumsy, I now know for sure that you really tried hard to live a kind life. That dream of yours is really a valuable and precious thing. It’s going to be very hard, but try your best to run away. I will try my best to stop them. And I hope that you continue to work hard towards your dream. Just remember that even though other people laughed at your efforts and dreams, I always cheered for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, hey. There’s no way I will let him go. Don’t try to take care of him like that. It’s too good for someone like him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After mocking Lubella, Grotim switched his attention back&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And you should also take responsibility. You kept giving this woman false hope and swung her here and there. Take responsibility by putting your life on the line. If you are a man, you should do at least that much. Even if you didn’t know anything…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What&nbsp;</span><span>is it that I didn’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;know?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich finally opened his mouth. Grotim was taken back. Zich’s voice was way too calm despite the situation they were in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Does this punk not know&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;situation he</span><span>’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s in right now?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It could be true</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">; he was the one who drew those strange, crude drawings as a magic circle on those statues after all.&nbsp;</span><span>H</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">e might not have been a sane</span><span>&nbsp;person</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in the first p</span><span>lace</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those weird drawings that you drew on the statues—I don’t know where you got such a strange idea that those things would work, but all of your efforts were useless. Instead of solving the problem, all you guys did was play right into my hand and drove yourselves into the corner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s voice was still calm. And as if it was nothing, he dropped the bomb.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I already knew all that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I knew that you were trying to lure Lubella in, so you were helping us get to the statues.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim and Lubella were on opposite sides at every possible aspect, but at this moment, they were united in their shock. They looked at Zich with wide eyes. Grotim’s shock seemed to have impacted the</span><span>&nbsp;undead</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;creatures and monsters because they also stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">igh. I have no time for your nonsense. If that is true, why did you bring Lubella to me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Obviously, it was to end you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich swung his swords around to make his point, and Grotim scoffed at his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And how would you do that? Do you seriously think you have any chance of victory in this situation?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Undead creatures and monsters surrounded them. Even though Zich was skilled, it seemed impossible for them to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It would be impossible with just the two of us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was annoying to admit, but it was true. If Zich was back in his Demon Lord days, he could have destroyed all the</span><span>&nbsp;undead</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;creatures and monsters in a split second, but it was impossible to do so in his current state. However, it was because he knew all this that Zich made this double-trap plan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you seriously think I went around drawing those darn magic circles cause I thought they would have some kind of effect on your po</span><span>wer</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim’s and Lubella’s hearts took another hit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…</span><span>Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ou went around drawing those magic circles even though you knew there was no effect?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For what purpose?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Until now, Grotim thought Zich and Lubella were all playing in the palm of his hand and looking down on them. However, if Zich were right, his feeling of superiority would have all been an illusion, and their situations would be completely flipped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While Zich continued to calmly explain his side of the story, Grotim’s frown began to grow deeper.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“First of all, the reason why we came here is simple. It’s to bring down a bastard like you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bring me down?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. I didn’t want you to escape and leave an uncomfortable feeling behind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, Zich didn’t want to waste the opportunity to crush Grotim’s spirit and hope. Grotim was silent, but after a few moments, he burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahahahahahah! To bring me down? Are you not able to remember what just came out of your mouth? You told me with your own mouth that it would be impossible for you two to defeat me! And now you just change your mind? Hahahhaha!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because of how hard he was laughing, Grotim clutched his stomach, and tears came out of his eyes. Then he wiped his tears and said</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As expected, you are not in your right mind. Fine, let’s say that everything is going according to your plan. Then what’s going to happen now? Are you going to say you lied about how it was impossible for just the two of you to beat me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, that wasn’t a lie. Just the two of us have no chance against you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich shrugged his shoulders, and the smile did not leave his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As I said, if it was just the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">two</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean? Are you telling me you have a backup or something? Sorry to inform you, but it’s too late for the Kingdom or the Karuwimans to come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But there is one. A backup.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You said I was mistaken in thinking that I could interrupt the ritual and went around bringing Lubella everywhere. But that was not it. I was trying to buy time all along.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grotim’s face, which had been smiling a moment ago, hardened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t warn you that I would be destroying those statues for no reason. I did it because I wanted you to think that we would&nbsp;</span><span>come</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;back to you. I was trying to make you push the date of the ritual.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s voice was lively, and his tone was cheerful. In contrast, Grotim’s face began to worsen slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I thought you would definitely push the date of the ritual since you would want Lubella—a ‘prized possession.’ You must have helped us so that we could meet you as soon as possible. Well, it was kind of funny how I tricked you into thinking that we were all in the palm of your hand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mr. Zich, then are you saying that what we did before and even this situation&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;all according to your plan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that is&nbsp;</span><span>what I am saying</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lubella’s face was not that different from Grotim</span><span>’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. No, her face seemed more shocked than&nbsp;</span><span>his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You also tricked me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s because I didn’t know how good you were at acting.
