 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…To tell you the truth, I came here to check if the earthquake made an impact on the mine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because of all the crazy events that happened so far, Sam forgot why he had come to the mine in the first place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was that earthquake also related to the magical beast?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yep. But to be more specific, it’s because a shitty bastard forcefully fused Snoc and the magical beast together.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…That shitty bastard was the one who made Snoc like this, right? What kind of bastard was he?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t know. I’m sure that he is part of some mysterious organization, but no matter what I did, he wouldn’t open his mouth so I killed him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich really had no idea what organization the robed man had been part of, even with the memories before his regression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But don’t worry.” Zich laughed, “Since they’ve already made me their enemy, I’m going to fuck over every single one of them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m so happy because I don’t have to feel guilty about beating up bad guys.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Sam was furious at the assassins and the mysterious organization that harmed Snoc, he could not readily support Zich’s words. Fortunately, the smile on Zich’s face did not last long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But couldn’t you have checked up on the mines during the day? Why would you come all the way here at such a dangerous time? It’s no wonder you got involved in such a dangerous situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich half-opened his eyes and rebuked Sam. But Sam felt more comfortable at the Zich who rebuked him rather than the Zich who smiled eerily at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, you are right.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam’s voice was full of regret. It sounded as if he also thought it had been a foolish decision. But Zich could understand why Sam wanted to go check up on the mine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s probably because of his father.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam’s father died from a collapsed mine shaft. Even though no one would be inside a mine after sunset, Sam was worried that someone could be trapped in the mines. There was a low possibility that this would happen, but Sam’s trauma made it difficult for him to dismiss them as low possibilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But thanks to Mr. Hans, I was safe.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh yeah, I was wondering about that. Why is he here with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans blinked his eyes as all the attention went towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When I told him that I was going down to the mines, he told me that he could take me there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir, while I was waiting for you, I saw Mr. Sam walk by our window. He told me he had to check up on the mine…it was late in the night and because he is your friend, I thought I should escort him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected of a former servant, Hans was very adept at quickly judging the situation. If Hans hadn’t been there, Sam would have met his end inside a dark mountain. Moreover, it would have been a tragic end for Sam as his brother would have killed him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You did well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich praised Hans for his efforts. It was Hans’ second compliment—all on the same day. Hans felt happy that he got some praise from Zich who usually yelled and insulted him all the time. Zich scratched his chin with his fingers and snickered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you are also really impressive. I didn’t think you would forgive him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam was traumatized by his father’s death to the point that when an explosion erupted, the first thing he did was go check up on the mines late into the night. Zich was still surprised about Sam’s decision to forgive Nowem who was deeply tied to his trauma.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so surprising? As Snoc said, it's not like the magical beast caused the mine to collapse on purpose.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From Zich’s experience, humans acted on emotions more than reason, especially on sensitive matters like a parent’s death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I would never be able to forgive that magical beast if he did it on purpose, but that’s not what happened. Snoc would also never side with a being like that. I also thought it was fate as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fate…" Zich repeated Sam’s unexpected mention of fate. “What do you mean by fate? When you were talking to Snoc about it, you mentioned fate when you were talking about a song, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You probably also know that song. It’s a song about a monster sealed inside the Iruce Mine. It’s famous everywhere around Suol.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, I know.” Zich nodded his head. “But wasn’t that song a warning to fear the Mining Monster? I don’t think there was anything about fate in that song.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s actually another version to it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam opened up one of his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is a song passed down by Snoc’s family, and his parents used to sing this version. In this version, there are actually a few more verses at the end. Snoc and I liked this version of the song more than the one spread around in the city.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam used to sing that song whenever he felt like it, and Snoc sang that song whenever he was sad or hurt to comfort himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t know which one is the original version. But if the version passed down in Snoc’s family is the original version, and one of Snoc’s ancestors preserved this song and passed it along to their descendants, it would not be far-fetched to say that Snoc and Nowem are destined for each other.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is the song?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich became curious after hearing so much about it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Should I try singing it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam inhaled a deep breath and began singing. His voice echoed under the dark sky, in a messy and demolished mountainside wrecked by battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc opened his eyes. All he saw was desolate earth. It was a completely different view from the mountain top.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Wow, this really is possible.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc looked around in curiosity. From what Zich said, he was in Nowem’s mind. No matter how compatible someone was, going inside another being’s mind was extremely difficult. But Snoc and Nowem were forcefully fused. Their special circumstances greatly lowered this barrier to the extent that Snoc just had to follow Zich’s directions and want to go inside Nowem’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Where is Nowem?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected of a beast of the earth, only dirt and ground existed in Nowem’s mind. From his feet and to the ends of the horizon, Snoc only saw earth. There was not even a single weed, a trace of a stream, an insect, or anything. Snoc felt overwhelmed by the vastness of the earth. He didn’t even know where to start looking for Nowem.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, contrary to his feelings, Snoc’s footsteps were light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I think it’s here.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As his heart stirred, it seemed to tell him the directions of a place. His feet didn’t stop for a moment. He climbed on top of the nearest hill next to him and saw a cave inside a gentle slope. Snoc went inside. The cave was pitch-dark, but strangely, Snoc had no difficulty seeing the insides of the cave. Snoc tilted his head as he wandered inside the cave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Isn’t this our mine?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The structure and support systems were the same. The remains on the walls and traces of digging were also the same, and Snoc’s footsteps became a bit lighter. Snoc continued to go deeper inside the cave and stopped in front of a pit. He stared at the pit for some time. This was where his father died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After letting out a deep breath, Snoc entered the pit. After the roof-fall, the entrance was open and clean. Snoc passed over the area and continued walking. He did not have to walk far to reach the end of the pit; and in front of him, he found what he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nowem.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem was lying down on his stomach, and he opened his eyes. When he saw Snoc, he bared his teeth. Nowem’s reddened eyes indicated that he was still under the influence of the sealing stone. Although Zich had warned him that this could be the case, physically seeing Nowem in this state pained his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Nowem.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc tried calling his name again. Just a couple of hours ago, he had no trouble calling out Nowem’s name, but now, the name felt unfamiliar to his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kuuuurgh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem made a loud cry. Just a moment ago, it seemed as if Nowem had cried out in happiness to welcome Snoc. Nowem’s cry now was strange and filled with hostility, but Snoc remained calm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc barely managed to open his mouth; he felt as if he was forcefully trying to open a sealed door, or as if he was forcefully opening a blocked stream inside a mountain belt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His first words were an apology. It was the only way he could start talking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry for trying to push you away. I’m sorry for ignoring you too. I’m sorry for everything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After the first couple of words, everything else flowed out easily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I was resentful and angry at you. I was confused after hearing that you were the reason for our fathers’ deaths. And I also felt guilty. If I kept staying by your side, I thought I would be sinning against my father, Sam’s father, and Sam. I felt like this because Sam is a brother and a family member to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc met Nowem’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Like you are to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem’s eyes were still glaring at Snoc. It seemed like Snoc’s words weren’t reaching him, but Snoc didn’t linger on his disappointment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you know, I can’t seem to stay mad at you. As people say, is it because our mana properties are so compatible?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Honestly, Snoc was a bit disgruntled that the reason why he felt great attachment for Nowem wasn’t because of the time they spent together or the faith they had in each other, but for some innate reason. However, it wasn’t as if someone had forced or brainwashed them to feel these emotions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I still can’t accept you. Even if you didn’t do it on purpose, it doesn’t change the fact that the earthquake you caused was the reason for our fathers’ deaths. However, Sam said that he forgave you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc was able to find the courage to continue because of<span style="color: rgba(65, 65, 65, 1); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; float: none; display: inline !important">&nbsp;his brother’s precious apology.</span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Still, I can’t act the same as before when I didn’t know anything. So, Nowem, let’s think about what would be best for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>With firm resolution, Snoc reached out his hand that had been previously used to push away Nowem; with his movement, Nowem’s eyes moved towards his stretched-out hand. Would he react to Snoc’s&nbsp;</span><span>sincerity</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? Sweat collected on Snoc’s palms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kuuuurgh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Snoc’s expectations and&nbsp;</span><span>hopes were completely</span><span>&nbsp;shattered. Nowem continued to growl while baring his teeth, and it didn’t seem like he would regain his&nbsp;</span><span>senses any</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;time soon. Perhaps, it was because Snoc had turned away from Nowem’s tears when the robed man told him the truth. Snoc became overcome with grief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Snoc gritted his teeth and calmed his shaking heart. He still had a chance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Sam told me that my meeting with Nowem might be fate.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The song that his father and mother had taught him since his childhood was proof that they were fated to meet each other. His vocal cords rang, and a voice flowed out. It sang with rhythmic beats and changing tones. Snoc’s skills didn’t compare to professional singers, and he kept singing out of tune and going slightly offbeat. Yet, everything else was steady and clearly indicated how often Snoc sang this song.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“An ancient being filled with wrath comes down upon us like a tidal wave. It's a disaster that has never been seen before. People shiver in fear at his presence. His name is synonymous with fear.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a song that invoked fear towards the beast of the earth. Everyone in Suol, including Snoc, thought that the song had been spread to prevent children from entering the mine. After all, the lyrics were unpleasant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem’s eyes turned menacing. Snoc succeeded in pulling out a response from Nowem, but he wasn’t happy about it since the response was on the negative side. However, Snoc’s song didn’t end there.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But the ancient being seals himself for the sake of his friend’s happiness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>These were lines that were passed down only by Snoc’s family and showed another side&nbsp;</span><span>to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;mining monster, which had always been a subject of great fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With each passing night, the ancient being swallows his sadness and with a hopeful heart, falls into slumber.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc sang out the last line like he was breathing out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dreaming that the happy future his friend spoke of would soon arrive.”</span></p>
