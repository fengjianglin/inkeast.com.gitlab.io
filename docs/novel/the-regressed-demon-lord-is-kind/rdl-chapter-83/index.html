 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Brod! You have to take Sir Joachim and all the other soldiers to a safer location!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even knights with high resistance fell ill to Ms. Bargot’s blood. If ordinary soldiers merely made contact with Ms. Bargot’s fluids, they would die instantly. It would be especially fatal to Joachim who was frail in the first place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir,” Brod quickly carried Joachim on his back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have to save the knights who collapsed—!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir, it’s already too late!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Joachim saw the knights who were on the ground become completely still, he bit his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Ms…Bargot…!” A dying voice cried out to Ms. Bargot. Shalom, who was on the ground after getting attacked by Zich, also got some of Ms. Bargot’s blood on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite his half-transformed state, he also couldn’t fight off Ms. Bargot’s disease and had rashes all over his skin. He stared incessantly at Ms. Bargot. It was hard to tell if his eyes were filled with worry or grudge. No one could tell what was reflected in his eyes. However, before people could even guess what it could be, his head lost strength and dropped to the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After being consumed by guilt, Ms. Bargot had played Shalom. It was a pathetic end for someone who committed murder against countless innocent people. However, there was not a single person who cared about his death. Everyone around him had already forgotten him—even Ms. Bargot, whom he had called out to in his last moments.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get all the regular soldiers out of the castle immediately! The knights will fight off Ms. Bargot. Make sure to never touch her blood or any other fluids!” After Joachim loudly shouted this order, he escaped from the prayer room. The soldiers and knights who were gathered outside the door began moving.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He’s really an impressive guy.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim calmed himself down quickly and made the most rational decision for his subordinates. Even though he no longer had the strength as he did when he was the ‘Vampire’, he was still an impressive person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich called out to Hans who was next to him. “Hans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, Hans had been a step away from the other knights and had not been splattered by Ms. Bargot’s blood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Unless you are given a separate order, just step back and help out the knights a bit. If you try to fight Ms. Bargot with your current skill level, you will die pointlessly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand, sir!” At Zich’s order, Hans moved further away from Ms. Bargot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I see that Sir Joachim left. How about it? I also have no intention to stay any longer in the Dracul estate. Why don’t we head off to our own paths now?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A knight shouted, “Shut up! How can we let a witch like you go!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[But clingy men are not my style.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She moved her hand. As if to slap the knight, her palms swept past him with a terrifying sound. Just the sound of her palms moving inspired sweat to drip down people’s backs. However, the knights did not waver and moved closer to Ms. Bargot. Zich also put himself between them and wielded his sword. However, they had no choice but to halt the momentum of their attacks. If they wanted to knock her down, they had to stab her with a sword, but if they did, blood would spurt out. And her blood gave mysterious diseases to everyone who came into contact with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ms. Bargot fully utilized that to her advantage. If she got injured on her arm, she would wield her arms even more widely, and she would spit at them every few minutes. But most of all, she possessed enormous physical strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘This would be so much easier with a magician.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich clicked his tongue and stepped one step closer than the rest of the knights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Oh my! Would you also be taking care of me?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How can I not? Especially when we were in such a passionate relationship.” Zich aimed his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Fufufu! Thinking back on it, I think you were a good escort despite your cold personality. Then shall I turn up the heat?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ms. Bargot raised her hand. Her sharp nails shone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Rip! Riip!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It all happened in a matter of seconds. Ms. Bargot scratched herself, and a terrible wound appeared on her body. Blood flowed out like a fountain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it!” The knights quickly tried to move back. With Ms. Bargot’s movement, blood droplets flew across the air. It was as if blood was raining down on them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Man, she’s making things so complicated.’ Zich poured a large amount of mana into his sword. As if he was knocking on the air with his sword, he slightly hit the air above him a few times. In a matter of seconds, the mana from the end of his sword let out a burst of mana into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Explode!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if the air had been hit by a hammer, a shockwave exploded in the air. All the blood droplets in the air flew to a corner of the wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[…I thought of this when you survived a surprise attack in the village, but your fighting abilities really are impressive.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since the shockwave was not directed at her, Ms. Bargot did not even feel the slightest bit of pain. Zich’s technique had been aimed at the blood droplets and not at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m confident that there is no one above me in skills at least.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[How trustworthy. But all you did so far was push away a blood storm. I can make something like that as many times as I want.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">True to her words, blood flowed out of Ms. Bargot’s body and soaked the whole floor. Her wound was now almost completely healed, but the amount of blood she let out was already an overflowing amount.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really are a troublesome opponent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the truth, even Zich might get infected if he made contact with her blood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But it’s annoying to see you act like you’ve already won.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich infused more mana into his sword. But this time, he didn’t concentrate the mana into one part of his sword or strengthen his sword by infusing mana to the entire sword. Without any sort of precision, he forcefully injected mana inside the sword. However, the force of his sword was extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Zing!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sword rang. It sounded almost as if it was ferociously roaring to pay back all the times it was mocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hissss!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sword turned red, and the air around it slightly wavered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Thud!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Zich&nbsp;</span><span>pushed off from his feet</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and lunged towards Ms. Bargot. She reached out her hands at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich easily evaded her attack. Even though her physical prowess were extremely frightening, she had never received formal training and was full of openings. Her tough skin was now right in front of him. His eyes landed on one area of her body. It was the wound on her body that had not completely healed yet. The wound was now as small as a fingertip, but that was enough for Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Push!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich smoothly pushed his sword. Normally, blood would have spurt out of her wound and erupted all around her. But shockingly, no blood came out of her wound. Only the smell of burnt smoke spread all around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Urghhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Ms. Bargot screamed out loud. She squirmed like she couldn’t stand the pain, and&nbsp;</span><span>Zich pulled out his sword. However, the sword had already cut through her deeply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&lt;Ugh! Urgh!&gt;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How is it,&nbsp;</span><span>miss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich asked sweetly while watching Ms. Bargot clutch her wounded areas.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sure you feel like your wounds are burning.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a skill that heated the sword’s body by rubbing it roughly with mana and creating friction. Zich&nbsp;</span><span>had a simple name for the skill:</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;‘Scorching Sword.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Since it affects the sword’s durability, I didn’t really want to use it.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it had a definite effect. Blood didn’t spurt out of her wounds and&nbsp;</span><span>seemed to have</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;burned the disease&nbsp;</span><span>on the inside</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It also slowed down her regeneration.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the most effective attack to use on Ms. Bargot. Zich continued to attack. He avoided her hard skin and targeted the already open wounds with slow regeneration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Kuh!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ms.&nbsp;</span><span>B</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">argot tried to inflict wounds on her own body and spray her blood; but as soon as her fingernails reached her skin, Zich’s sword&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">lew her way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Kuahhhh!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Zich’s attacks sliced pieces of her body, she felt an immeasurable amount of pain. And whenever he stuck his sword into Ms. Bargot’s wounds, the sword’s heat traveled to her insides through mana. Ms. Bargot could&nbsp;</span><span>not harm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;herself as the wounds she had purposefully created turned into her weakness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knights who had been watching her from behind also began to help Zich. Since they couldn’t attack without splashing blood, they helped by blocking Ms. Bargot’s attacks or protecting Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Kuuuah!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Another deep wound formed in Ms. Bargot’s abdomen. The smell of gas and meat reeked out of the wound this time, and Ms. Bargot realized that she could really die this time. She felt a great sense of danger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I-In a place like this…?]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She gritted her teeth.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Do you think that I would die in a place like this!]</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her characteristic, composed way of speaking disappeared. She stretched her mouth wide and bit into her own arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Chomp!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her powerful teeth easily crushed her hard skin. Blood</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">incomparable to the amount from&nbsp;</span><span>before, poured</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;out, but Ms. Bargot didn’t loosen her jaws and bit even harder into her arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Craaack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a terrifying din, Ms. Bargot’s arm was perfectly severed from her body. Then, she grabbed onto her severed arm and flung it around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A-Avoid it!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knights withdrew and shouted in horror. Blood poured out from her arm like a fountain and fell like rain. Even Zich had to increase his distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&lt;Kuah!&gt;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While shrieking, she threw her arm at Zich, and to avoid it, Zich made a large leap to the side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ms. Bargot turned her back. Then, she dashed forward and slammed her shoulder on a nearby wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The thick wall broke down powerlessly, and the downtown area came into view through the hole that formed from the impact. Ms. Bargot jumped down the hole.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Is she escaping?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich hurriedly followed her and shouted to the knights</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will hold her, so all of you tell Sir Joachim immediately that Ms. Bargot escaped! If she heads to the downtown area, there will be a lot more damage!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y-Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hans! You follow Sir Brod. Follow his orders!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knights scrambled to get out of the entrance; they also knew what would happen if Ms. Bargot—who could be called the breeding ground for epidemics— went outside of the castle. Hans also followed them and ran outside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Plop!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Zich jumped down from the hole. The place he landed on looked like the castle’s gardens.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘This is actually preferable.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was more comfortable to battle in a wide area than inside the castle where there were many barriers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Here, I can just strike any&nbsp;</span><span>skill</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;without a second thought.’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he thought of it like this, it was actually better that Ms. Bargot had escaped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Still, I can’t let her go outside of the castle.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Zich let her outside, the damages she would cause were unthinkable. Then, suddenly, Zich smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I can’t believe I’m trying to reduce people’s sufferings right now.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wondered what the Demon Lord, Zich Moore, from before the regression would think if he saw Zich’s current self. Perhaps he would mock him, click his tongue, or give off a&nbsp;</span><span>bloodthirst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. But it didn’t matter. Regardless of how he used to be, this was the present now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Even my past self can’t dictate how I will live!</span><span>’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After pouring an immense amount of mana to his legs, Zich quickly dashed towards Ms. Bargot. The&nbsp;</span><span>speed at which</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;she escaped was incredibly fast, but he caught up to her before she got away from the castle. It was fortunate that the castle’s premises stretched far and wide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Daaamn it!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Formalities were non-existent now. While letting out a string of aggressive curses, Ms. Bargot waved her remaining arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That way of speaking fits your current appearance! Truthfully, I thought it was disgusting how you kept maintaining elegant speech even after your appearance changed like a monster!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich also dropped his formalities and swung his sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After she lost her arm, Ms. Bargot had lost one of her means to attack and struggled to maintain balance. Thus, for Zich, Ms. Bargot’s attacks were very easy to evade.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Claaang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His sword and hands shot forth. A rough sound rang out. Zich didn’t engage in a battle of pure strength and only used attacks that could distort her momentum.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Wobble!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As her large body began to sway, Zich aimed the area where her arms had been severed. His sword was already exuding out steaming heat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Slice!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Ah!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ms. Bargot groaned in pain. She tried her hardest to finish off Zich, but the more she tried, she got tangled up in his movements even more. The difference between their fighting experiences was astronomical.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Kuu!]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps, she judged that she couldn’t succeed no matter what. She turned her back again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Is she planning to just make a run for it?’</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich clicked his tongue like he thought it was pathetic.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Does she think I will just watch her leave?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were already many cuts all over her body, and Zich no longer needed to go through the trouble of trying to pierce through her hard skin.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘She’s too dangerous—for me to keep her alive to get information. I should end it here.’</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich filled his sword with mana. Since there wasn’t anybody near him, he thought he would blow his opponent away with a huge attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Red pillars of light shot up. They contained a great amount of heat and scattered&nbsp;</span><span>their</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;brilliant light to its surroundings and&nbsp;</span><span>shot</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;forward toward Ms. Bargot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Bam!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t rough or loud—the sound of the blows calmly resonated and Ms. Bargot’s upper body disappeared entirely. As if the pillars of light weren’t satisfied with just that,&nbsp;</span><span>they</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;blew up all the ornaments in the garden and vanished into the faraway sky. The force was eye-opening, to say the least.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ms. Bargot’s lower&nbsp;</span><span>body, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had lost its&nbsp;</span><span>top, staggered</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a couple of steps and collapsed to the ground. Its wounded areas were charred completely black&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;not even blood dripped out of them. And that was the end of ‘Greta Bargot’—the one who used the Dracul estate as her personal experiment site and playground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s target, Ms. Bargot, was dead, but he didn’t let his guard down. Instead, he heightened his senses even more. The final blow which had killed Ms. Bargot wasn’t Zich’s work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who is it?”</span></p>
