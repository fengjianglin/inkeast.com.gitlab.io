 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam woke up. He felt as if he had just gotten out of a long tunnel, and he felt dizzy. But paradoxically, his body felt normal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He came back to his senses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He heard a familiar voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Zich?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. It’s your great friend Zich.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam got up. He was in his house. As if many people lived in it, his house was filled with multiple pieces of furniture and daily necessities, but somehow it didn’t look very hospitable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t remember?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You went to Drew to settle a complaint and got totally beaten up.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew. He remembered now. After hearing that Snoc got conned, he went to complain and got beaten up until he thought he was going to die.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Twitch!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Recalling the trauma, Sam’s body trembled. There were times when he got into a fight while doing rough mining work, but that attack had been on another level. A person who killed living creatures for a job had used violence against him without a care for his life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if he caught what Sam was thinking, Zich said, “I completely avenged you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Avenge?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Didn’t I say this to you before? If you die an unjust death, I will avenge you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t die though?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You were beaten up until you were a foot away from death’s door. I’ll count it as the same thing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this point, Zich seemed to do whatever he felt like doing. Sam let out a burst of laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How did you avenge me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I just returned everything back to him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Return?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The injuries you sustained. I inflicted the same, exact wounds he gave you- from fractures to small scratches.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam couldn’t close his mouth. Although he had fainted, he knew that his wounds had been severe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that person still alive?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not sure. After I beat him up, I stopped paying attention to him. It’s his problem if he dies there or not. But I don’t think he will die since the guy from the Monster Exterminator Building was watching. He probably got some aid. Well, but…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Even if he is still alive, he won’t be able to go for anybody again. Since I completely crushed</span><span>&nbsp;his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I-I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam didn’t know what Zich meant by ‘crushing a person’s mind,’ but he didn’t dare to ask. The conversation ended like that. Truthfully, Sam didn’t want to hear more about the man who beat him up. A part of him felt relieved, hearing that the guy became a mess like him, but another part of him felt chills imagining what Zich did to Drew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“How much&nbsp;</span><span>time has passed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;since then?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Two days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All those injuries healed in just two days? Actually, I think my body feels better than usual?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I used potions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam had heard about potions before, but he’d never seen one in real life. Although he made a good wage as a miner, it wasn’t enough to buy a potion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t that expensive?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“It is a bit&nbsp;</span><span>pricey</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but it’s not unaffordable. I can earn as much money as I want anytime anyways.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Adventurers are amazing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not adventurers who are amazing. I am just amazing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as if Zich’s face was painted in metal; if his face was really painted with gold, it would have been enough to buy a castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The price for the potion…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t need it. I don’t want to take money from a poor friend.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Then, I will buy you a drink later.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I won’t refuse that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the same as repaying gold with sand, but Sam accepted his friend’s consideration with gratitude and his heart stirred with emotions. Although Zich was cold to others, it seemed as if Zich really thought of him as a friend.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then Zich took out things from a box, which changed the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s fair compensation that I got from Drew: medical bills, rewards, nuisance expenses, and so on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam shouted in surprise, but while smirking, Zich opened the box like a gangster checking all the money he collected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, now that I think about it, you went to Drew to complain about the money he took from Snoc, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, Sam thought about complaining directly to Drew, but he gave up on that. After encountering him once, Sam knew that common logic didn’t work on Drew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let me see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich opened the box’s lid, and items poured out. Sam stared at the goods that piled up on the floor next to his bed. He couldn’t believe that gold coins were falling from the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let me see, how much did I take?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…What is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam asked about the box first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s an artifact. It lets you store goods regardless of their volume or weight. There’s a limit, but it’s a handy item.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich made a refreshing smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was from that guy. I took it as compensation for the many things he did.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, these gold coins…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re also his.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam couldn’t find the right words to say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, it’s yours now. That guy was pretty rich. With this, you can easily pay for the price of the potions, but of course, I have to share it with you and Snoc who suffered the damages.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich gripped one of the gold coins and put it in front of Sam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, how much do you want for compensation?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, no. I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Even though he had been one-sidedly beaten up by Drew, Sam refused the immense pile of wealth in front of him&nbsp;</span><span>instinctively</span><span>. The large sum of money made him feel&nbsp;</span><span>uncomfortable</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;rather than greedy, and Zich didn’t continue to press the matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really? Okay. I guess people will be surprised if so much money gets forced in front of them so suddenly. But if you change your mind, tell me anytime. The time limit is until I leave this city.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich placed the gold coins back into the box, and the mountain-pile of gold coins disappeared instantly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell me the amount Drew stole from Snoc so I can evenly distribute the sum. I can only decide how much to take after I know how much to leave you and Snoc.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did you also suffer any losses?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich told Sam that the money was a form of compensation. If Zich took some of the capital, it meant that he also suffered a loss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“On top of the stress he gave me for attacking my friend, he forced me to move and even insulted me. It won’t be enough even if I sell him as a slave and get more money. Considering how I ended the matter with so little, I am so generous.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It sounded like the calculations of some back-alleyway gangster. Sam studied Zich’s face, and he wondered if Zich felt any sense of guilt or embarrassment from his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It doesn’t seem like that at all.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s face was composed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>To not hurt Zich’s feelings, Sam asked carefully,,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Um, didn’t you say that you would live a kind life? Is it ok for you to do something like stealing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why do you say stealing? I keep telling you that all I did was receive fair compensation. It doesn’t affect my resolution to live a kind life, at all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In the end, Sam followed the path that Hans had taken a few days ago. He reaffirmed his beliefs that Zich’s train of thought was completely&nbsp;</span><span>out of common way of thinking</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and gave up on trying to understand Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew walked inside a mountain. He looked completely fine even though Zich had left him half-dead not so long ago. It was thanks to the priest, who Paul Chenu called. However, no matter how well the priest healed him, he wasn’t the same as before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">First of all, he didn’t have any money. Zich took all the money and items he had as ‘fair compensation.’ Thus, he didn’t even have the money to pay for his medical bills and had to borrow money by using his artifact. If Zich hadn’t thought that the goods inside his artifact were enough for his compensation, Drew wouldn’t even have had the money to cure himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For that reason, he had to go out to catch monsters as soon as his wounds were healed. But there was a more serious matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew swallowed his saliva back down. His heart ached. His wounds were already all healed, but he sometimes felt pain for no reason. The cause was probably psychological, and he knew when these side-effects first started.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That bastard…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Rage and hate flared up, but simultaneously, fear and despair filled his heart. Zich had inflicted the same wounds on Drew as Drew did to Sam without a trace of discomfort on his face. Even Drew was aware that he was a person without any sense of humanity, but he thought Zich far exceeded him in that area. Drew was sure Zich didn’t feel any guilt or joy when inflicting wounds on a person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It was just a job for him.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In short, Zich didn’t look at him as a human or even a living creature.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Damn it! Stop! Stop it!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His legs trembled out of control, and he slammed his fists on them. The only thing that came back to him was more pain and bruise marks. He couldn’t stop his legs from trembling. Drew knew what this side-effect was. It was what people who battled monsters or fought other countries’ wars suffered through. It was what Drew had mocked as, ‘Coward Reader.’ But now, he was facing the condition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew also knew the way to stop this side-effect: removing the cause of the trauma. But as soon as he thought this, his heart fell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Fighting…with that guy…again?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s face, his slimy smile, and his stern pupils—as soon as they popped into Drew’s head, all the strength in his legs left him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Drop!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He collapsed to the ground. Thankfully, he was in the mountains, and no one saw him. However, he didn’t feel relieved; more than embarrassment, fear overcame him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I-It’s impossible.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was just a small fry who was a bit strong. The thought of facing Zich again after overcoming his fears pained his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, dear! Your condition is worse than I expected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He suddenly heard a voice he disliked and turned his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When did he approach me? A figure covered from head to toe in a black robe stood in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It hasn’t been long enough for me to say… it’s been a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a kind and warm tone, but Drew didn’t feel an ounce of sincerity in the man’s words. It was the robed man who had struck a strange deal with him recently. The man met eyes with Drew and then crouched his knees on the ground to be on the same level with Drew. He made the motions as if he was a parent making a point to his children. However, the man’s face, which was covered by the robe’s darkness, gave Drew chills.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you come here for?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have another commission that I want you to take care of.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is it? I will take it if it’s decent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man gave Drew a fortune for merely helping Snoc activate his mana and making him walk through the mine until he met a mole. For Drew who seriously lacked money, the offer couldn’t have been more attractive. However, the robed figure glanced up and down at him like the man was assessing Drew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will you be able to do it? I heard you were badly beaten.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am fine enough to take a commission.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What if you have to clash with the man who made you like this again?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew’s face became dead-pale, and his hands shook.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s hopeless.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I had a hunch, but this is beyond my expectations. I didn’t think he would be broken down to this extent.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man thought Drew’s usefulness had gone down to zero.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man twitched his nose in dissatisfaction and straightened his knee. Drew saw that the man was going to take back his offer, so he shouted urgently, “I-I can handle it! I was going to get my revenge on that guy any—!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, thanks,” the man answered. Any trace of politeness disappeared from his speech, and his tone was dry. Drew froze at the man’s sudden change.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Push!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A blade pierced Drew’s throat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t need you.”</span></p>
