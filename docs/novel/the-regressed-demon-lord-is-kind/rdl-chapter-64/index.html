 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I was just taking a stroll in this bright night and found you awake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that Joachim mentioned it, Zich noticed that the moon was especially large and bright today. Even a person who didn’t normally stroll for a hobby would have felt a strong urge to go on a walk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What made him become a Demon Person?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Currently, there are too few clues. But it must have been something huge for someone who has hemophobia to start using an ability like Blood Domination.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir, how is the Count’s condition?” Zich asked to grasp Joachim's current situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You must have heard the rumors. To tell you the truth, his condition is not very good. It has been half a year since he fainted, but he is still unconscious. I am very worried about him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich could see that Joachim was clearly worried for his father. At the least, it didn’t seem like Joachim was the type of son who wanted his father to die to gain more power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s probably different for that bastard Biyom though.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I guess that’s why the first son of Count Dracul has full authority.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, he is the oldest. Of course, he should take it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Joachim’s voice had a hint of bitterness to it that indicated his negative feelings towards Biyom. From then on, Zich continued to ask about Joachim’s current situation. Of course, Zich was indirect in his questions since he didn’t want to raise Joachim’s suspicions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many conversations passed between them, but Zich wasn’t able to gain much information. However, it wasn’t all useless since he gained assurance that his guesses had been correct.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘The Count lost consciousness half a year ago, and he is still bedridden. Biyom Dracul took that chance to grasp power, and he is now pushing Joachim and his forces to the edge. It’s a common story.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he looked around the world, Zich would be able to find at least dozens of similar stories. Then Zich suddenly came up with a funny thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Should I play a trick and make Joachim Dracul succeed as the Count?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t a bad thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Then, I can fuck over Biyom at the same time.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The best way that Zich liked to play with people was to give them a false sense of hope and quickly take it away; but he also liked the method of taking away what his opponent wanted or valued the most.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I should stay next to Joachim and make him the Count. At the same time, I can beat up the assassins who’d probably come to make Joachim into a Demon Person and extract information from them.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a plan that perfectly suited Zich’s tastes. If he wanted to carry out this plan, Zich had to establish a greater sense of trust with Joachim. He couldn’t simply remain as the traveler who helped Joachim greatly; he had to become a confidant who Joachim trusted enough to confide in about the next course of action.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that in mind, Zich talked to Joachim all night. He lacked time, especially considering that Joachim would likely be confined in his room again when he returned to Ospurin. However, Zich’s worries about lacking time disappeared when Joachim’s task force received another order from the castle. It was a shitty order that told them to relocate immediately to another village hit by an epidemic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soldiers skillfully blocked the roads leading to the third village and separated the infected villagers from the uninfected villagers. Their bodies were now accustomed to the work. After they separated the villagers into different zones, they began to give out treatments. However, since they had failed to save the first and second village, no one was hopeful about their ability to save the third village. And they began their work with low spirits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, there were significant casualties among the task force. Although the soldiers and caretakers had taken extra precautions when dealing with the patients, some were infected. If most of Joachim’s task force couldn’t control mana and didn’t have a strong immunity towards diseases, they might all have died like the villagers. Naturally, people’s morale was at rock bottom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, they realized that the disease spreading in the third village was different. Its deterioration rate was slow, and symptoms weren’t as severe as before. It was a terrifying thing to discover a new disease with a high number of infectants, but everyone’s faces were bright. They hoped for survivors this time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But even that hope soon disappeared. Although the disease’s deterioration rate was different this time, in the end, its fatality rate was also 100 percent. Just like that, the third village disappeared. And something that happened three times was bound to happen another time; an epidemic spread in another village, and the task force forced themselves to move once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he moved the corpses again, Zich scowled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘This is definitely weird.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not only was it strange that there were so many outbreaks, the infection and fatality rates were way higher than normal. Furthermore, all the villages were at a considerable distance from each other. If the epidemic had spread across closeby villages, the trend was understandable, but that was not the case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It almost seems like someone has purposely staged it.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich analyzed the information he already knew, such as the assassins he met some days ago. However, there was no need for him to deeply think about this matter. The word epidemic immediately made him think of one person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Did that bastard already begin to move?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich didn’t know the person’s name, age, or gender. However, there was a figure who left clear marks in history and made the whole world tremble in fear just by their nickname. Their appearance started with the extinction of a kingdom’s capital due to diseases. Because the world was in chaos, the medical system, managed by multiple countries, couldn’t operate properly, and epidemics spread easily through armed conflicts. Thus, in the beginning, people simply thought that a severe epidemic was spreading.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the epidemic started to spread all over the world and began to kill more humans; and soon, people realized that there was a being artificially spreading diseases all over the world. They only found out about the being’s existence and didn’t find out anything about their identity. As a result, people began to call the person who could control diseases with the name: “Demon Person, Fest”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘The only thing well-known about Fest was that Glen Zenard killed them. Their identity was a mystery till the very end. But was that Demon person here at a time like this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was too early to be sure, but there was a possibility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If Fest is here, that means there are two people who could be Demon People here.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Two Demon People. Before the regression, any normal person would have flipped their eyes and thrown a commotion at hearing that there were not just one but two Demon People in their residence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Anyhow, I think I’ll only be able to find a solution after returning to Ospurin.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was nothing much he could do while he was stuck in the countryside. In the worst-case scenario, Zich planned to leave Joachim’s side for a moment to make some changes in Ospurin. Yet, since Fest might be involved in this case, Zich decided to wait and watch for a little longer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If Fest is involved, I will have to return to Ospurin anyways.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few days later, all of Zich’s predictions were proven exactly right. After they burned the fourth village down and finished all their work, everyone’s expectations were at the lowest of the low. They expected to go to another village soon. Yet, in contrast to their expectations, they received an order to return as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the capital of the Dracul estate, Opsurin, an epidemic was spreading.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were finally going back as they wanted, but there were shadows cast on people’s faces. The capital city was being swept by an epidemic, and they didn’t know how severe the situation was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact that Ospurin was hit by an epidemic seemed to indicate the severity of their situation—especially considering that the current diseases were worse than anything they had ever seen. The task force quickened its footsteps. A large portion of the party, especially knights and officers of high position, had families in Ospurin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they arrived at Ospurin, the situation wasn’t as hellish as they expected it to be. But the ominous black smoke that shot up into the clear sky made their hearts heavy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim led his forces to Ospurin and observed the civilians’ complexions as he headed for the castle. He could instantly tell that there were fewer people in the streets than usual; and the faces of people who were wandering around were filled with fear. But thankfully, the epidemic didn’t seem to have completely spread throughout the entire city.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Open the gates!” Joachim shouted when he arrived at the castle. Before, the gatekeepers turned away Zich and his companions under Biyom’s orders, but this time, they opened the path for them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I don’t know the exact situation, but it seems like the residents in the castle are taking this current situation very seriously.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For Zich, this was welcoming news. He had to get inside the castle to retrieve information so that he could stir something up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if everyone was allowed past the castle’s gates, not everyone could enter the castle. Joachim picked his closest subordinates and asked Zich to also accompany him. This was because Joachim thought he would need Zich’s broad knowledge and wisdom; besides, Zich’s efforts to earn Joachim’s trust was also paying off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Zich entered the castle, he could finally meet Biyom face-to-face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He looks like the opposite of Joachim.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In comparison to Joachim who was tall and skinny to the point that he looked gaunt, Biyom was short and obese.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘How can brothers be so different from each other?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only characteristic they shared was that they both looked like they were suffering from a chronic disease.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have arrived, brother.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim’s voice was filled with dissatisfaction. It was natural for Joachim to feel this after all he had gone through; he and his task force had moved from one disease-ridden village to the next without much rest. Considering all this, it was astonishing how little dissatisfaction he showed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Biyom’s response wasn’t all that great, and it was clear that he didn’t look favorably towards Joachim. However, his eyes, which looked smaller under the piles of fat, darted and made him look anxious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You heard about the situation, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That an epidemic was going around Ospurin?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, as I expected, it seems like you guys brought the diseases from the villages.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was absurd. The words he said to his younger brother after Joachim worked so hard in the infected villages were unbelievable. However, Joachim was used to this, and he didn’t get agitated. Zich thought it was ridiculous that Joachim was even used to a situation like this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s impossible. To prevent ourselves from spreading the diseases, we waited for a long time before we returned to the city. There was no one who developed symptoms in that waiting period.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There could have been someone who showed symptoms, and you might have hidden that fact!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim let out a sigh. “Then, what should we do now? Should we stay far away from Ospurin again? Should we stay there for several months this time?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Obviously you and your men should do that, but since I’m so generous, I will give you a chance to make up for the sins you might have committed. Stop the epidemic from spreading in Ospurin.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim wasn’t even surprised since he had expected this response. If it weren’t for this reason, their return would have been pushed back even further.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I guess he considers me experienced in this field.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim mocked himself. It was ridiculous to call himself experienced when he couldn’t save a village even once. But soon, Joachim made a firm resolve. This was the Dracul estate capital, Ospurin. If this city also reached the same fate as the villages, the number of deaths would be incomparable to the ones in the villages.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I really have to stop the epidemic this time.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will move immediately, so please give us some support.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will leave that up to Shalom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man beside Biyom nodded slightly. Was he serious? Biyom had continuously played tricks on their support supplies, so Joachim looked at him doubtfully; but in the end, he looked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He can’t play his usual tricks since Ospurin is involved.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim moved out to begin his work in stopping the epidemic, but as he was leaving, he heard Biyom’s voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, and don’t think about returning to the castle until the epidemic is over. The epidemic can’t spread inside the castle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I understand,” Joachim replied while gritting his teeth and tightly clutching his two fists.</span></p>
