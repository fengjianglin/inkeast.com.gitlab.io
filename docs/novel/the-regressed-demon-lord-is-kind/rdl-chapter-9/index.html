 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Following his father’s order</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Greig went inside the dueling ground. The sword&nbsp;</span><span>at</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his hip seemed to grow heavier, and his feet seemed to drag him down as he walked towards Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, fuck! It hurts! That’s enough!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then get treated first!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I told you—I’m going to fight without getting treated!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then shut your mouth for a moment! It’s going to be over soon!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The priest shouted at Zich as he began to wrap bandages on Zich’s injuries. Despite Zich’s annoyed expression and complaints, he moved his body to make it easier for the priest to bandage him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m all&nbsp;</span><span>done</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it finally over?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I only performed emergency care, so please remember that you are&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">this</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;close to suffering from extreme blood loss! Whether you win or lose, please quickly finish the duel and get proper treatment…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oooh, don’t I look like an undead? I look like a mummy right now. If someone meets me in a dungeon, they will think I will attack them…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please listen to me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich had to forcefully push away the priest who looked as if he was about to cry. Without saying anything, Greig watched the situation unfold and stared at Zich. As Zich said, his whole body was covered in bandages like a mummy. Since he had only gotten minimum emergency care, blood quickly seeped through his bandages.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘How the hell is he still moving?!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig thought he had good endurance, but seeing Zich’s current state, he realized that&nbsp;</span><span>he</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was nowhere near Zich’s level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich began to wave his sword around; it was to check if the bandages hampered his movements. As expected, his injuries widened again, and blood began to seep through the bandages at an even faster pace. However, Zich didn’t seem bothered by this and looked pleased that the bandages did not hinder his body’s movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich gave a signal that he was ready for battle, and Tiner, the host, cried</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Draw your swords!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no other rhetoric this time. In consideration of Zich’s injury, it seemed as if Tiner was trying to proceed with the duel as fast as possible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig pulled out his sword and Zich lifted his sword up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Start!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The second duel, which no one except Zich anticipated, began.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig looked a bit scared, but since he had been training for a long time, his stance was s</span><span>teady</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. In comparison, Zich held his sword around his shoulder in a sloppy manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s up with you? Are you not coming toward me? Are you seriously expecting your injured brother to make the first attack? I didn’t know you were such an awful bastard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich provoked Greig lightly, but Greig merely fixed his grip and did not rush to attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Calm down. The situation is advantageous for me right now.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wouldn’t have been strange if Zich fainted at this very moment. Compared to Zich, there wasn’t a single injury on Greig, and he was in a good condition. Of course, Zich’s skills were unexpected, but even considering that, the situation still favored Greig.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I know this! How can I not know this!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike Zich, Greig had gone through many different types of training and education. But why was he…why was the hand on his sword shaking?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you really not going to come at me? I guess you never had an ounce of cuteness in you. Okay, fine. Your dear brother will make the first move.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Swish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich swung his body forward. His entire body, from the very tip of his foot, shook a bit as he moved. Indeed, his injuries&nbsp;</span><span>impacted</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;him, but the way he moved towards Greig was sharp and clean.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig raised his sword to block Zich’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It has less force than I expected.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The numerous injuries on Zich’s body seemed to have affected his fighting power.&nbsp;</span><span>P</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">aralyzed with fear and nerves, Greig began to feel hopeful again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I can win!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it was when Greig recovered his confidence and raised his sword to attack—</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clashhh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig barely managed to block Zich. As if he was a leaf flying in the wind, Zich landed another swift attack on Greig.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig took a moment to steady himself. Right above him, Zich’s attacks poured down like a rainstorm. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘H-his attacks are different from before!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Each of his attacks was light, but they were all lightning fast. His current style was completely different from when he was fighting with Byner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His attacks are completely different from before!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trell could not help but express his shock. No matter what other people thought, he wanted the best person to succeed as the Count. Zich’s unexpected talent was a fortunate miscalculation for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, people like him were definitely in the minority.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While considering the Count and Countess’s feelings, Chris Nunn carefully answered Trell, “He probably changed his fighting style because of his injuries. Since his injuries would widen even by the force of their swords clashing, he is absorbing the force of the attack as much as he can.&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">t seems like he</span><span>’s also</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;reflecting some of the force back towards his opponent. Look at him right now. Can’t you see that he is using the rebounds against his opponent?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this an easy thing to do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course not.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even while replying, Chris Nunn felt troubled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Sir Zich is even more talented than I thought.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From what Zich had&nbsp;</span><span>shown</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;them so far, at least in regards to fighting prowess, his ability was close to being god</span><span>like</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Even after just awakening his mana, he was able to use high-level skills right away, turn a duel into a deathmatch, and drive Byner into a corner. And right after that, he challenged Greig and maintained an upper hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘And it’s not just his basic skills. He cleverly&nbsp;</span><span>exploited</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Byner’s lack of experience and sh</span><span>ook</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;him up psychologically to increase his chances of winning. He really understands the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">know-how to win.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And this “know-how to win” was an absolute necessity for the Steelwall family that always needed to protect themselves from intruders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I thought Sir Greig was good enough to be the next Count, but…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chris Nunn stole a furtive glance at the Count and Countess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Their expressions seem strained.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could understand their feelings. Once again, Chris Nunn looked back towards the duel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘With Sir Greig’s skills, he would become a good Count. However, if Sir Zich becomes a Count…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And if Zich’s other abilities were even half of his fighting abilities…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He would become an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">outstanding</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Count.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His skill, bravery, and guts</span><span>. F</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">or Chris Nunn</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">who was a military man to the core, he&nbsp;</span><span>couldn't</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;help but admire Zich’s many talents, especially his fighting prowess. Likewise, there were probably many who&nbsp;</span><span>shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Chris Nunn’s feelings right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chris Nunn start</span><span>ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to lean towards Zich’s side</span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;tried to harden his heart. And&nbsp;</span><span>as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the butler for this family, Trell had a deeper understanding of Zich’s abilities than Chris Nunn</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">who was purely a military man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘His ability to plan is astounding.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Trell&nbsp;</span><span>keenly watched Zich push Greig back&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">with a severely wounded body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘With Sir Zich’s skills, he will be able to slowly push back Sir Greig. However, this process will be very lengthy, and many unexpected situations can arise. I’m sure that the Count and Sir Greig will use many different tactics to prevent Sir Zich from succeeding. However, with this duel, Sir Zich&nbsp;</span><span>is</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;able to&nbsp;</span><span>display</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his skills to everyone in Steelwall, and I’m also sure that this will shake up many people.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chris Nunn, who was standing next to him, was a clear example of this. Even though he tried to stay low in fear of the Count and Countess, Chris Nunn couldn’t hide the sparkle in his eyes as he watched Zich’s fight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Sir Zich probably expected the Count to&nbsp;</span><span>blow up</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the situation like this.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he hadn’t known this, Zich would</span><span>n’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">t have been able to make the situation so advantageous for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘No, even if he hadn’t predicted this, it doesn’t matter. It just means that he is extremely adaptable, and he can make any circumstance advantageous to him right now.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Either way, Zich had the brains to perform such a feat, and it was even more outstanding that he was able to think all of this while being surrounded by enemies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Even if Sir Zich loses this battle, no one will think he actually lost. He was able to beat the genius knight Byner, and even with serious injuries, he&nbsp;</span><span>fought</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a second duel right after. Even though they are dueling for the succession, it is informal after all.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Zich and Greig’s reputations&nbsp;</span><span>were the same</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;as before, this informal promise would have made a tremendous impact on Zich’s name. However, this duel had completely changed Zich’s image.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Moreover, if Sir Zich manages to beat Sir Greig in his current condition, there will be an enormous ripple in Steelwall.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s ability to fight consecutively despite his severe injuries was especially significant in Steelwall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He was able to sharply reduce his risks and increase his returns at the same time. When I heard that he raised a sword against a servant to kill him in front of the Count, I thought he had finally exploded in anger after suppressing his feelings for long, but he exploded in a totally different way.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though there were still many things to consider for the future, Trell wanted to side with Zich at this moment. The knights and officials all had their own thoughts about this matter, but the Count was most taken back by Zich’s performance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>...</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His stubborn expression became even more strained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a shaky voice, the Countess looked at the Count with wavering eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our Greig won’t lose, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Count did not reply. He continued to watch the duel in silence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If Zich wins right now…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the head of Steelwall, he would have to welcome Zich’s change&nbsp;</span><span>with open arms</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but the Count didn’t feel this way at all. The Count’s head began to ache from thinking about the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-indent: 36pt; text-align: left"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clashhh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, Greig blocked Zich</span><span>’s attacks,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and Zich used the force of the rebound to land another attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Wow, it hurts like crazy!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Zich acted like he was alright, his whole body was a mess. Even&nbsp;</span><span>for a warrior who</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had gone&nbsp;</span><span>through</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;all sorts of challenges and trials, he could not help but let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s starting to get really serious.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pretty soon, Zich would be unable to move from dizziness caused by intense blood loss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Since Greig seems scared enough, should I begin my&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">deathmatch</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig flinched at Zich’s sly smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Strike!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>tried</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to restrict his force as much as he could</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">struck the ground with tremendous strength. Blood spurted out of his wounds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">urprised, Greig dropped his sword.&nbsp;</span><span>Greig</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;</span><span>shifted</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his weight&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his right foot and leaned back to avoid&nbsp;</span><span>Zich</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">’s attack.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;However, he couldn’t fully escape, and Zich’s attack scraped Greig’s arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Zich did not stop his movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Wait, this is!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig’s heart s</span><span>a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">nk to the bottom. It was easy to see what Zich was planning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘A deathmatch!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Greig expected, Zich began to swing at Greig without paying any attention to his injur</span><span>ies</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Slice!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig took a few steps back. A long, red cut appeared on his chest. It was not a deep cut; only his skin was slightly injured, but Greig’s heart began to beat fiercely against his chest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My dear brother! Why don’t we&nbsp;</span><span>begin</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;showing our brotherly camaraderie for real now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without a single consideration for Greig’s feelings, Zich continued to smile while wielding his sword around.&nbsp;</span><span>Psychologically driven into a corner, Greig&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">began to lose control of his sword. To Greig, the sight of Zich&nbsp;</span><span>swiveling</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;around his sword with blood dripping down on his smiling face was the perfect image of a demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Clash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As their swords collided, their faces came even closer. However, their complexions were completely different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother, my brother, my darling brother, why are you making a face like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wh</span><span>y</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;does my expression matter!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig managed to reply with some cheekiness. However,&nbsp;</span><span>s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ens</span><span>ing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Greig’s fear, it only felt&nbsp;</span><span>like</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a scared dog barking to Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you afraid? What are you afraid of? Does your great brother suddenly look scary to you? Or are you more afraid of wha</span><span>t’ll&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">happen after you lose?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“</span><span>...</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Greig did not reply</span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich did not care.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahahahah! You don’t have to worry! Do you really think your own brother would plan this show for the sake of destroying you? This is all for you. All the emotions that you are experiencing right now—anger, fear, jealousy—they all exist merely for the sake of&nbsp;</span><span>pushing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">you one step further!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surprisingly, Zich was not saying empty words to Greig. However, who was Zich if he did not have malicious intentions?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I guess if you are unable to pass this hurdle, you will just collapse from the stress of it all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s beast-like eyes&nbsp;</span><span>pierced into</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Greig’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Personally, I desperately wish that you will meet the latter with all my heart and soul!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s sharp words, which were even worse than the sharpness of Zich’s sword, severely cut Greig</span><span>’s heart</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The duel began to grow more and more dangerous and rough. The bandages on Zich’s body&nbsp;</span><span>fell</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;apart, and the number of injuries on Greig’s body began to increase.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Greig&nbsp;</span><span>had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;trained for a long time, he still lacked real experience in battle, and the pressure he felt from Zich suffocated him to the point that he had difficulty breathing. The bravery he was so determined to possess could not be found. Moreover, the brother he had always looked down on and mocked looked absolutely terrifying to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sur….!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At last, he gave in to the pressure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I surrender! I surrender this duel!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Halt!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s frantic sword movements stopped at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Thud!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The strength in Greig’s legs left him, and he collapsed onto the floor. In front him, Zich’s bloody sword swung in front of him. Zich withdrew his sword and then lifted his head to look at Tiner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At last, Tiner firmly lifted his hand and shouted</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Victory! Victory</span><span>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Honorable Sir Zich Steelwall!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tiner’s announcement was a gunshot that rang through the Steelwall family</span><span>&nbsp;that signaled&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">the beginning of an enormous change to come.</span></p>
