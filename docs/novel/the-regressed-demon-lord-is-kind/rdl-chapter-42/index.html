 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam was completely healed from the potions Hans brought. It was the result of using not just one but three potions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Sam did</span><span>n’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">t recover consciousness right away. Since he also received mental damage, it would take at least one</span><span>&nbsp;or more&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">days for him to&nbsp;</span><span>gain consciousness</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. After&nbsp;</span><span>send</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ing Sam safely back to his house, Zich leaned in front of the&nbsp;</span><span>M</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">onster&nbsp;</span><span>E</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">xterminator&nbsp;</span><span>B</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">uilding and waited. It was obvious who Zich was waiting for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Paul Chenu came out of the building a few times and&nbsp;</span><span>then</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;said, “Hey, honestly, we don’t want to be involved in this conflict.&nbsp;</span><span>Since</span><span>&nbsp;that Sam</span><span>&nbsp;guy has already been healed, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he security officials also won’t enforce severe punishment on Drew.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To the high officials, the victim was just a miner. Moreover, it was not a conflict that occurred inside the city, so there was no reason for security officials to actively resolve this conflict.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you cause a scene here and harm this building, it would be troublesome for us. This is an important national institution.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This building was more important than the life of one miner. This was not a surprising development since life was cheap in this world. Zich also knew this</span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he&nbsp;</span><span>didn’t feel the need to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">complain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry. I will resolve this conflict without causing harm to the surrounding area</span><span>s.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Also, it would be troublesome for us if you actually kill Drew. He was one of the adventurers we hired after all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course. You might not believe it, but I want to live a kind life. I’m not going to</span><span>&nbsp;easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;kill someone, so don’t worry too much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And as if to support his statements, Zich smiled brightly at Paul Chenu.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I don’t really feel reassured by that smile.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Paul Chenu flinched and took a step back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, just don’t create a situation where we have to be involved.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was the&nbsp;</span><span>main reason for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Paul Chenu’s pestering; he didn’t want to be involved in a dangerous and complicated affair. Zich also&nbsp;</span><span>didn’t blame or</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;insult Paul Chenu’s self-preserving attitude.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Although</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Paul Chenu said everything he wanted, he didn’t go back in and stared at Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich was about to ask Paul Chenu if he needed anything more from him when Paul Chenu&nbsp;</span><span>first said</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, “Are you confident that you can beat him?&nbsp;</span><span>Our team specially recruited him</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Even among the mercenary soldiers, he is very skilled. If you attack him with mediocre skills,&nbsp;</span><span>you’re the one who’s going to get beat up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich blinked his eyes. He stared at Paul Chenu as if he was seeing a strange, new species for the first time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W-why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Ah, I guess. Yes. Yeah, I guess you can think like that. You said something I didn’t expect at all, so I was a bit taken aback.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really, what’s up with you? Did&nbsp;</span><span>it not even cross your mind</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;that you could lose?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich nodded, and it was Paul Chenu’s turn to be surprised. Zich’s confidence was over the roof.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘No, thinking about it, Drew is also super cocky. Are all adventurers or travelers like these&nbsp;</span><span>guys</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Paul Chenu’s house and career seemed&nbsp;</span><span>very</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;precious to him then. No matter what happened, Paul Chenu firmly resolved to stick to his career and views for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was common to exterminate monsters multiple days in a row.&nbsp;</span><span>Thus</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Zich planned to wait at the exterminator building for several days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, to his good fortune,&nbsp;</span><span>Zich</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;did not have to wait long. Drew appeared the day after he assaulted Sam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On that day, Paul Chenu&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;surprised to see Zich still standing in front of the entrance and quickly went inside the building. Then in the afternoon, Hans provided a simple meal for Zich to eat. After Zich finished his meal,&nbsp;</span><span>he continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to stand in front of the building like a stone statue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was now almost sunset. The shadows were getting longer, and the blue sky was about to turn yellow. Zich, who had his eyes half-closed, fully opened his eyes. There was a spark in them. He felt a presence near him—a presence he had desperately wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He’s here.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich uncrossed his arms and stopped leaning</span><span>&nbsp;against</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the wall. After a few moments, he saw someone strolling towards the building.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was Drew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew’s footsteps were light; he showed no signs of even an inkling of guilt at his heinous actions. There was even an easygoing, giddy aura&nbsp;</span><span>exuding&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">from him, as if he felt refreshed after taking out an aching tooth. Even without looking at Zich, Drew tried to get into the exterminator building.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew crinkled his face. But when he saw who stopped him, he let out a mocking smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, who is this? Aren’t you the comrade of that weak ass who took his sweet time defeating a barely developed troll?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected, Drew was quick to insult him, and Zich’s expression did not change.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I told you he just started his training…well, whatever.&nbsp;</span><span>Actually</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, aren’t you really sick in the head? No wonder you don’t remember what I said to you recently. I’m sorry about that. I should have been more considerate of your stupidity.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a miraculous sight to see Zich&nbsp;</span><span>apologize</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. However, it was far from a proper apology.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be too hard on yourself. It’s not a sin to be sick. Even though it would be really hard to live like that, you have to stay positive. Do you understand what I’m saying? Cheer up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Zich continued, Drew’s expression worsened</span><span>. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hen Zich waved his fists to “cheer” him up, Drew’s face looked as if it was going to explode.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…I thought this last time, but I really have to crush you down properly. It would also be a good idea to pull out that smart tongue of yours.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Drew pulled out his sword, Zich also pulled out his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is such a dilemma! I don’t want to fight with a sick patient!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich continued&nbsp;</span><span>to talk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;while laughing. But&nbsp;</span><span>a second later</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, his face became serious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I just want to make sure. Did you beat the crap out of Sam?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sam?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You know, that guy who came to complain to you right after you threw away that Snoc kid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, that trash?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew did not deny it. Instead, he insulted Sam and laughed</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No wonder you were waiting for me. Have you come to avenge that trash?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For now. He’s my friend.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Friend?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew laughed out loud.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As expected of someone who hangs out with a weak ass! You make friends with losers. No, no—this is perfect. You guys are perfect for each other! Yeah! Like a loser, all of you should roll in mud together! Won’t&nbsp;</span><span>everything</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;be better with a friend? Don’t you think so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s up with you? Are you that type of person…</span><span>who&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">judges people’s skills based on their friends</span><span>’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;skill levels?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Birds of a feather flock together! I can tell how strong you are by the company you keep!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re flat out wrong. Well, I guess this is not something a person of your level would know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich clicked his tongue and continued, “Listen carefully. People with mediocre skills like you befriend people who are similar to them so that they can make useful connections. You guys make friends based on people’s social status or skill levels. But you know, people like me are different.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Normal societal standards did not&nbsp;</span><span>apply</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to Zich at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t care about my friend’s social status or skill level. Do you know why? It’s because I’m a super genius who doesn’t need help from anyone. I don’t need to care about stupid and foolish people who judge my skills based on the company I keep. Why should I care about standards or status? I only care about hanging out with people I have fun with.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich pointed his sword towards Drew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not that someone like you would know. You only know how to use your friends to lift yourself up.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are all talk.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Usually, people say something like that to me when they are unable to understand my profound words. But if you can’t even beat me in trash talk, what can you beat me in?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you are so confident in your skills, try showing&nbsp;</span><span>them</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Tap!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew began moving. He lowered his body and moved straight towards Zich. It was a simple movement, but Drew’s whole body was surrounded by mana, so it&nbsp;</span><span>had a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;tremendous amount o</span><span>f&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">force.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Bam!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew rapidly stopped in front of Zich. The dirt underneath him made a loud ‘crack’ sound at his sudden stop. His joints creaked at the immense force of his movements. Then he transferred the force of this movement into his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I’m not planning to kill him, but—’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I’m going to cut off one of his arms!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">How dare this punk mock him. If they were not in the middle of a bustling street, Drew would have cut off Zich’s neck a long time ago. That was the punishment for a person</span><span>&nbsp;who</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;mocked him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If he dies from blood loss, it’s not going to be my fault.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew was going to be merciful and cut off just one of Zich’s arms, so if Zich die</span><span>d</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, it would not be his fault at all. Drew honestly thought&nbsp;</span><span>he was being merciful</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;as he moved his sword towards Zich’s shoulder. Even though Drew was now very close to cutting one of Zich’s shoulders, Zich made no reaction at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He really was all talk. It’s too late to react now.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew put mana into his sword, and it&nbsp;</span><span>became</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;strong enough to cut a person’s arm like it was a slice of&nbsp;</span><span>meat</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Tang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The pathway of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew’s sword was disturbed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Did he just flick off my sword?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With just his thumb, Zich flicked off the side of Drew’s sword. Drew could not even see Zich’s movements, and it was even more disturbing that Zich was able to block his mana attack with just one finger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What is this…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew could not believe what was happening. His situation felt unreal, and he watched his body spin like he was an outsider to his own body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Punch!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew lifted his chin up; he was suddenly able to see the sky. Then, he felt a floating sensation. From start to finish, he was unable to grasp the reality of his situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What? What is happening?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Drew had experienced all sorts of things as an adventurer, he had never felt anything like this. But an inkling of suspicion began to enter his mind. He could not believe it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Am I getting beat up?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to believe, but right now, reality was pressing down hard upon him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Bam!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Arghh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew rolled many times on the floor. He had no time to even&nbsp;</span><span>cushion</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the force of his fall, so his whole body was completely sore. Moreover, his left cheek&nbsp;</span><span>burned</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Spit!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew spit out stuff from his mouth. Two white substances dropped onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were his teeth. He spit out more of his blood and put one hand on his cheek. In that short time period, his cheeks swelled up&nbsp;</span><span>to a</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;great&nbsp;</span><span>size</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W-wha is harpe—"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His pronunciation was off as the wind whistled through the missing holes in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How is it? Isn’t it exciting?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich laughed and shook the fist that he used to hit Drew.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get up, you little shit. I wouldn’t have even started if I was going to end this with one punch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew stood up quickly. If he had just stayed on the ground, he would have gotten attacked without being able to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wha kin of cheawt did yew use!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew shouted at Zich.&nbsp;His pronunciation made his words sound funny, but Drew was completely serious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A cheat? Are you actually sick in the head for real? Ah, no wonder. I understand&nbsp;</span><span>why</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;you don’t want to face reality right now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without even being able to properly resist, Drew got completely beaten up. Zich was leaps above Drew’s skill level. But Drew’s arrogant personality would not let him accept this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Have you never thought that you could lose because you only target guys weaker than you? I will change that mindset for you. In that sick head of yours, I will squeeze the</span><span>&nbsp;reality&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">that this world is filled with people way stronger than you. You don't need to pay me for this lesson. I will specially make it free for you!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike before, Zich was now the first to attack. His sword moved straight like a wild horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew tried to block Zich’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Smash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Argh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich did not use any special technique or movement, and he did not even move fast; he just used brute force. But this was enough to make Drew let out a cry of pain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Smash! Smash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s sword came down on Drew like thunder. Even though it seemed like Zich was wielding his sword without much thought, his sword precisely attack</span><span>ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;any gaps in Drew’s defense. Drew frantically backed away and tried to block Zich’s attacks. His hands felt like they would rip apart from blocking Zich’s constant attacks, but if Drew&nbsp;</span><span>lost</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;focus for even a&nbsp;</span><span>second</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, his sword would have dropped from his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have a gap here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kick!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich kicked Drew’s ankle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Falter!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>W</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">hen Drew was about to change his center of gravity,&nbsp;</span><span>Zich landed another attack</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Drew lost his sense of balance and faltered. Zich used this to his advantage by quickly landing another attack on Drew with his knees.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Slam!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s knees landed directly on Drew’s celiac plexus, which was located in the middle of his abdomen. It was a sensitive area, and Drew could not breathe. But that was not the only&nbsp;</span><span>hit that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Drew received.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Break!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An ominous sound rang through Drew’s heart, and an awful pain came flooding into his body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew didn’t roll on the ground like he did last time. He was smashed into the ground like a piece of trash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh! Aghh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew clutched his heart and cried out in pain. He could not even breathe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmmm, from my judgment, I think two of your ribs are broken.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich had a lot of experience breaking bones. In a way, he might have more experience breaking bones than eating a meal. By just looking, Zich could tell how severe Drew’s injuries were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew used his sword like a staff to get up. It was hard to stand from all the pain he was going through.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cat got your tongue? Don’t you have to keep insulting a weak ass like me? Why, you are an amazing adventurer who can even hunt down&nbsp;</span><span>a full-grown</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;troll.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zick mocked Drew, but Drew was in no condition to reply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s no fun now that you are quiet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich swung his sword and came&nbsp;</span><span>closer to</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Drew. His movement</span><span>s were&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">like a cat playing around with his catch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, your skills suck ass. I thought you might have some skills because you were so arrogant, but you&nbsp;</span><span>are</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>way</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;below my expectations. If my opponent is this weak, there’s no fun in crushing them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew still&nbsp;</span><span>didn’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;reply. He was barely able to breathe and stand while leaning his whole body onto his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, whatever. I also didn’t expect&nbsp;</span><span>this</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to be a serious competition.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich stopped right in front of Drew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just be destroyed like this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wonv giv up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew managed to lift his head. The concept of giving up was nonexistent in his&nbsp;</span><span>expression</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Murderous rage, stubbornness, and pain were all complicatedly intertwined in his&nbsp;</span><span>face</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Diew!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew reached out his hand while crying out. Mana was moving strangely around his hand, and&nbsp;</span><span>a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">sound&nbsp;</span><span>resembling</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a bird’s cry&nbsp;</span><span>rang out</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He fell into my trap!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was Drew’s secret weapon. As an adventurer who was exposed to all kinds of danger, it was common for adventurers to prepare some kind of hidden weapon to use when their life was in danger. His secret weapon was an artifact that he happened to find in a dungeon. It saved hi</span><span>s life</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;many times before and completely changed the situation around when he was about to lose. With this artifact, Drew thought he could get Zich on his knees as Zich did to him multiple times in this fight. He thought this until…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He saw that there was not a single scratch on Zich’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W-wha…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew mumbled while crying out in pain. Zich moved his thumb and middle finger. There was a small arrow between his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can predict what guys like you would do. Did you really think that a hidden attack will work against me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich lowered his guard to draw out Drew’s attack. It was a tactic he frequently used before he regressed, and he had also used it against Zenard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘But I was really about to die during that time, though.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anyways, pretending to die, pretending that an attack worked—all those attacks didn’t work against Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘But I’m sure this tactic worked very well for him many times.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just by seeing Drew’s shell-shocked face, Zich could tell that Drew didn’t understand why his plan failed. But Zich had no desire to teach him why he failed; he focused all his attention on the small arrow in his hand. The arrow was about 1/3 smaller than an ordinary arrow, but the speed and sharpness of the arrow made it very suitable for a hidden attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hickk!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew managed to come back to reality and pulled out his arm again. Zich lightly kicked away that arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Another arrow flew on top of Zich’s head. Zich kicked Drew on the chest and when Drew was down, Zich stepped on his arms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aghhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew screamed out in pain from falling down, and his body shook&nbsp;</span><span>as</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Zich press</span><span>ed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;down on his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it an artifact?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich flipped open Drew’s sleeve with his foot. Between Drew’s wrist and the middle of his arm, there was a thin bracelet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It looks like an artifact that stores small arrows and lets one out whenever you want.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich stared at the arrow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s even poison in this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the green tip of the arrow, there was a small amount of mana coming&nbsp;</span><span>off it</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Zich was knowledgeable about tools like this because many different types of people had tried to assassinate him in his past life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘W-what kind of dude is this…!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was then that Drew finally realized he had picked on the wrong person. He realized that the person in front of him was impossible to defeat with his current level of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you going to do now that your secret weapon has been found out? There are some super cautious guys who prepare two or three hidden weapons, but you don’t seem to be that type. Oh? Does that mean you are completely defenseless now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Agh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew wielded his sword by instinct, but he was not in the position to instill his strength into it. Moreover, the pain in his chest prevented him from making a proper attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Tap!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if his sword was like the arrow, Zich grabbed the sword with his bare hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew cried out, seeing that his last attempt was completely futile against Zich’s strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whish!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich took the sword from Drew and threw it to the side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you have more?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich urged Drew to keep on fighting</span><span>. C</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ompared to Zich’s relaxed and carefree posture, Drew’s eyes were&nbsp;</span><span>drowning in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I guess it’s all over.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich pulled out all the teeth and claws of his prey. The only thing left for him to do was to end its life and disassemble the body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich began to move.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“S-spare me…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew began to&nbsp;</span><span>beg for his</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;life</span><span>; n</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">o trace of his former arrogance could be found.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, don’t worry. I’m not going to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich laughed. To Drew’s shock, Zich’s face at that moment was akin to a&nbsp;</span><span>s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">aint reassuring his patient. It was so peaceful and soft that even Drew began to grow hopeful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But what Zich said soon after shattered his hope</span><span>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;“I’m going to return back to you exactly what you did to Sam. What do you mean&nbsp;</span><span>by</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span><span>‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">sparing your life</span><span>’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? I’m not going to do such a horrible thing&nbsp;</span><span>as</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;killing you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Thud!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich pressed his feet down on Drew’s chest and&nbsp;</span><span>exerted pressure</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;into it. Drew screamed out in pain, but Zich did</span><span>n’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">t move an inch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why don’t we start with four shattered ribs?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Drew’s screams&nbsp;</span><span>rang</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in front of the exterminator’s building for a very long time.</span></p>
