 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You…shameless bastard!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Brod shouted out to Shalom while protecting Joachim. Even though he personally thought Biyom was trash, he still respected Biyom as one of the Count’s family. He thought Biyom shouldn’t be discarded and treated like some kind of diseased animal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Hmmm, you call me shameless.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom smiled mockingly just like the older knights in front of the inner gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…Are you really responsible for spreading the diseases?” Joachim asked carefully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yeah. I spread it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“For what reason?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“For judgment!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Like a lord making a stern judgment, Shalom said this with gravity and assurance. And from this, Zich found the answer to one of his most pressing questions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Ah, that guy is not Fest.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Fest he was familiar with would not say something like that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Now, there’s only one suspect left.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">While Zich calmly made deductions about Fest’s identity, the conversation between Shalom and Joachim continued.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“What do you mean by judgment? Your words are absurd. If you are so great that you can make judgments, who are you judging in this situation? Is it my family?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yes. I have a lot of people in mind, but the first group that I have to judge the most harshly and cruelly is you and your family. It is my greatest regret that I left you to that robed man. I should have also judged you with my own hands.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Also?’ Joachim repeated Shalom’s words inside his mind. Since Shalom said ‘also,’ there must be other people who he wanted to pass judgments on; Biyom was obviously included in this group of people, but Joachim felt that Shalom meant something else. An awful thought emerged from his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Wait, was the reason why my father fell ill—!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom laughed out loud. His laugh was cruel and evil. “Yep. I did that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Joachim’s efforts to remain calm went up in smoke. His wrath erupted forth and it was so intense that it felt almost tangible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It was really difficult to turn your father into this state. Unlike weak asses like you and your brother, the Count was a really strong person. His natural resistance against diseases is unbelievable. But whatever, I was successful in turning him into this pitiful state.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Why! My father was the one who let you work as a butler when you couldn’t work as a knight anymore! How can you pay back his generosity with revenge! Bastards like you are—!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>“Shut up!” Shalom’s shout rang throughout the house. “Generosity?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;">You</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;say generosity? Your father forcefully held me captive as a butler! How can I feel thankful to this asshole!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“He held you captive?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yes! He held me captive! As his accomplice, he wanted to spy on me and keep me in check so that I wouldn’t spout out his secret!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">An accomplice. It was definitely not a positive word. Considering what Shalom previously said about making judgments, Joachim became more confused about the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…What the hell happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Heh! Are you curious? Fine. Since the situation has turned to shit, I will tell you what happened. Do you remember how infectious diseases spread around this estate ten years ago?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…Yeah, I remember.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Infectious diseases were not calamities that appeared once every hundred years. They were common occurrences and spread quickly among people. However, Joachim remembered that the infectious disease that spread ten years ago was particularly dreadful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom pointed his fingers at the unconscious Count.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“At that time, this guy employed all efforts to stop the spread of the disease. Many people died as a result, but his tactics showed some favorable results. However, the estate also suffered a heavy financial loss.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Since many of the populace died, the amount of available human labor and taxes greatly decreased. At the same time, the Count’s efforts to stop the spread of the disease caused a serious dent in the estate’s finances. As a result, the estate possessed a massive amount of debt. Even though they were able to stop the disease, there was an intense “side-effect.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I know that as well. However, my father did an excellent job in overcoming this dilemma.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Excellent? Overcome?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom’s face twisted like a demon. He looked as if he wanted to pull out Joachim’s tongue and stuff it back inside his mouth to stop him from talking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You spout nonsense because you don’t know anything! In order to save the estate’s finances, your father screwed over a whole lot of people!” His shout carried tremendous pain. “The disease that spread ten years ago was Horim!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Horim—out of the known diseases in the world, it was renowned for being deadly and ferocious. Out of all the diseases, it competed at the very top places with other dangerous diseases in fatalities and transmission rates. Horim was called a devil’s curse because it not only completely destroyed people but animals as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Because your father was pressured by his piling debts, he secretly collected the corpses of infected animals. And then he spread it around the places that he owed money to!” Unimaginable words came out of Shalom’s mouth. People’s faces became pale. A shiver ran down their backs, and their hearts thumped fiercely. But most of all, Joachim’s face was as white as a corpse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom continued, “Then, of course, Horim appeared a second time to plague the people around us! And the new cases concentrated in places that your father owed money to. Places that trusted your father and his estates to pay their money back to! And as expected, the great amount of debt your father owed disappeared, and the estate was able to escape its dangerous financial situation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Don’t lie! If places that my father owed debts to were the only ones to get plagued by the disease again, everyone would have definitely become suspicious of my father!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It was because your father secretly borrowed money while accepting the high interest! While borrowing the money, he made excuses like he did not want to discredit the estate anymore!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“The people who lent him money didn’t even leave a promissory note?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Don’t you know that places infected by Horim are burned completely to the ground! Everything has to be burned! Even the building with the promissory notes was burned to the ground!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Joachim could no longer talk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“And as you said, your father is not stupid. He also spread Horim to other areas besides the places he owed money to—in places that would not affect the estate if they completely disappeared. At this point, people just thought they were experiencing a second wave of Horim. No one thought that someone would purposely release it again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">According to Joachim’s memory, he recalled that Horim significantly disappeared at one point and then rose up again a second time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Of course, not everyone died. Some people were not infected by Horim, and there were also some places that still had their promissory notes. The Count was very good at repaying the few people who were left. However, the estate was stable because a lot of the debt was gone. And most of all, it was because the place that the Count owed the most debt to collapsed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At this point, Shalom’s bloodlust rose a level higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“The Bargot Business.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">People held their breath. They remembered Greta Bargot’s great efforts to contain the epidemic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Is he saying that the Bargot Trading House collapsed because of that old man lying on the bed?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zich stared at Count Dracul.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Do you know what’s funnier? The Bargots lent their money out of the kindness of their hearts, unlike places that did it for their personal gains or to obtain interest from the money they lent. The Bargots said that since they started their business at the Dracul estate, they wanted to get involved and help as much as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I can’t believe it!” Joachim denied Shalom’s claims.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He didn’t want to believe his father’s faults, which he had never even heard of before. Yet, Shalom relentlessly crushed Joachim’s hopes by continuing, “Who do you think carried out his orders? Do you really not understand why the Count forced me to become the butler of this household and why all the older knights took my side?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“…You guys are the people who executed my father’s plans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Only people with tight lips and high resistance to diseases could move the corpses of people and animals who died from the epidemic. At that time, I thought that his orders were what was best for the Count, the people, and this estate. And above all, I was still caught up in the delusion that a knight had to always be loyal to their lord at all times.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A delusion—that’s how Shalom described the loyalty that a knight should have for their lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I was young, foolish, and ignorant. I was so beyond help that I can’t describe myself with all the insults in the world. But insulting myself doesn’t erase my past actions, so I thought…I should atone for my sins by placing you all under my judgment!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“And with that mindset, you decided to spread infectious diseases to multiple villages and kill numerous people?” Zich spat out his words and mocked Shalom who was self-justifying his actions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“And what is the problem with that? They were foolish people who pledged loyalty to Count Dracul without knowing anything! They should also know the pain of those who died and suffered for the sake of their land!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Man, this guy is completely out of his mind.’ Zich had seen many different types of revenge, but not all of them were alike. There was revenge that was only aimed at the person who harmed them, and there was revenge that stretched its vengeance to the offenders’ family members and everyone who had a relationship with them. Likewise, there were also many different types of methods to complete an act of revenge. Some didn’t want to stoop to the level of their offender and tried to minimize the impact their revenge had on others as much as possible. On the other hand, there were some who thought nothing mattered as long as they completed their revenge and didn’t mind inflicting harm everywhere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In general, if the revenge-seeker didn’t care how their actions negatively impacted innocent bystanders and the more people they involved in their plotting, there was a higher chance that the individual was out of their mind. In that aspect, Shalom was someone who had completely lost his mind. Thus, Joachim, who was shocked at the things his father committed, burned with rage again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Even if you resent my father, that’s no excuse for killing so many innocent lives! Did you not even consider their pain?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“It’s hilarious how the son of Count Dracul is telling me this! Your father’s actions were the cause of everything!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Oh, his ability to blame others is first-class.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom’s firmness and senseless belief that he hadn’t done anything wrong impressed Zich. However, he was only impressed by this, and Zich didn’t take Shalom’s side. Moreover, Shalom had one-sidedly agitated Zich before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘He probably was worried that his plans were going to fall apart from the cure I spread.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">But whatever Shalom’s intentions were, the important part to Zich was that Shalom had tried to provoke him before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“So, you are saying that you caused this whole situation, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yeah.” Shalom responded simply to Zich’s question and glared at him. “If you hadn’t intervened, I would’ve gotten my revenge without any trouble! Even the robed guy was right about this—I should have killed you first!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘The one who tried to kill me with everything he had was the robed guy.’ But even after Zich learned of this fact, it didn’t change anything. “That’s too bad. But what can you do when your abilities don’t match up?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom gritted his teeth, but he couldn’t retort. Even though he had planned everything out with so much pain, time, and care, his plan had failed in the end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Was it also you who cured the knights and the soldiers in the castle?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Yep, that’s right. It wasn’t a serious disease, so even an amateur like me could fix it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zich’s comment seemed to jab at Shalom’s pride, and Shalom’s face reddened with rage. His huffing and puffing rang inside the whole room. However, he didn’t explode with wrath. “…I will admit it. I misjudged your skills. I shouldn’t have thought that as long as I captured Greta Bargot, you wouldn’t hinder me from spreading diseases any longer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“So, you took Ms. Bargot for that reason,” Joachim said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>“I thought it was better to have fewer obstacles while I tried to spread infectious diseases.&nbsp;</span><span>Even I</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>was surprised</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;by the amount of knowledge that Ms. Bargot had. I didn’t expect someone from the Bargot Business to be my biggest obstacle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Where is she?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Find her by yourself.” Shalom replied curtly and sighed, “It's a pity, such a pity. There are still so many people left who I have to pass my judgments onto. I can’t believe I have to be satisfied with bringing judgment to only the Count and his eldest son.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You bastard! Immediately release the Count and Biyom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The reality was separate from the truth, and Brod stepped forward and shouted to save the two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>“Take them as you wish. It’s too late to save them anyway. They will die in pain in their miserable states. No matter how superb Zich’s medical abilities may be, he can’t cure&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;">this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">disease.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom made a dark smile, and his viewers could see how refreshed and happy he felt. Shalom’s hatred for the Count was unmistakably real. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“I have devoted so much care and time to this disease. Regardless of how great a person may be, this disease—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“You talk a lot for someone who didn’t even create the disease.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom was going on and on as if he wanted to boast, but Zich cut him off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Why are you desperate to brag about a disease that you didn’t even make?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Shalom’s face crumpled. “What non—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Sir!” Before Shalom exploded in anger, a soldier burst into the room. “We found Ms. Bargot inside the prayer room!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone’s faces brightened. Since she had played a huge role in calming the situation with Igram, Joachim had placed the matter of protecting her as first priority. On top of that, people felt sympathy and guilt after hearing about what had happened to Bargot Trading House. Thus, people rejoiced as if they had found their own family member. However, Zich’s reaction was different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Block the prayer room, and nobody must approach her.” At Zich’s unexpected command, everyone’s eyes shot towards his direction. “The one who spread the infectious diseases isn’t the butler over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zich smiled at Shalom who was looking at him with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“She—Greta Bargot is probably the culprit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone in the room froze at once.</span></p>
