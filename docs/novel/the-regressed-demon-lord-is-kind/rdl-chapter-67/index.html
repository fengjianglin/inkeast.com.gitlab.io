 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His tone, expression, and every movement seemed to provoke Zich. Although Zich had continued to meet people who approached him with bloodthirst and a sword, Shalom was the first one to pick a fight with Zich since he left Steelwall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Ah, actually there was Drew.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I asked you if you were Zich!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shalom pressed on Zich who was a bit dazed from the ridiculousness of the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘…Whatever my plan is, should I decide after killing this guy?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a moment, the current, pure (?) Zich thought of acting like his past Demon Lord days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing, Shalom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, Joachim intervened and prevented Zich from acting out on his anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘…Yeah, I should bear it. Just for a bit. Joachim is here, and I don’t have the power to take full responsibility for the consequences.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Currently, he wasn’t at Zich Moore’s level and couldn’t pull out his sword at every small annoyance and wreak havoc to his surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Okay, calm down. I am pure. I have become clean.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich calmed his heart; it was like trying to pour icy water onto a beating heart, engulfed by a fierce fire. While Zich calmed himself down and tried to pass this test of patience and self-control, a small argument went back and forth between Joachim and Shalom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve told you many times! Mr. Zich has helped us tremendously, so you can’t treat him rudely! I’m not going to say much about the way you treat me since that’s our family’s matter, but Mr. Zich has nothing to do with our family! What is this attitude you are showing him?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I want to ask you, Sir Joachim. How can you trust this man so much? Like you said, he has nothing to do with our family or this estate—he’s a stranger.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Didn’t you hear that he found the cure for Igram?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That makes it even more suspicious. Isn’t he just a traveler? How did he know about the cure for Igram? More so, didn’t he appear at the perfect time when Ospurin was hit by an epidemic? Don’t you think it’s too much of a coincidence, sir?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, what? Are you saying that Mr. Zich was the one who spread the disease?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t go that far, but it’s true that he is very suspicious.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really are…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim bit his lips to repress his burning rage. However, Shalom didn’t care for Joachim and stared—no, glared back at Zich. It almost seemed like Shalom was trying to rip Zich apart with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you Zich?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think you already know. Why do you keep asking me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s gaze was haughty, and his tone was sarcastic. Shalom’s eyebrows twitched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am going to ask you one more time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shalom’s body exuded an immense pressure; it was strong enough to cause Joachim to unconsciously take a step back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I asked you if you were Zich!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t that Shalom didn’t know Zich’s name. This was a battle of nerves. Even if Shalom was aware of Zich’s name, he was trying to make Zich answer his question; it was so that he could psychologically assert his dominance. However, Shalom couldn’t have had a worse opponent than Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What the hell is this old fart doing?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shalom’s actions were childish and the pressure he was exuding was ridiculous. He seemed like someone who could have been a leading figure in his prime, but his pressure was nothing to Zich who could control his mana however he wanted. Thus, Zich changed his posture. He twisted one of his feet crookedly and supported his back with only one hand. Then he tilted his head and spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard you, the first time. As I said before, don’t you already know my name? Or are you losing your memories due to your old age? Did you forget my name in that short amount of time?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shalom’s eyes twitched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…You bastard, you have no manners.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It depends on who I’m talking to. I’m the type of person who believes that courtesy is reciprocal and not one-sided.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, since Shalom was rude to him, Zich also wouldn’t be polite. Shalom’s eyes grew menacing, and his cheeks shuddered like they were vibrating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Fine. I will acknowledge your spirit, courage, or whatever it is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing that Zich wasn’t about to back down, Shalom took a step back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you have to answer this question! Where did you get the cure to Igram?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I saw it in a book before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since Zich had expected this question to come up, he answered it easily. However, his answer was too simple and shabby, especially considering that he had prepared his answer beforehand. Naturally, Shalom didn’t believe it either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A book? A book that contains information about the cure for Igram? How can you expect me to believe that?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the first time this cure had ever been introduced to this world—meaning that no one knew of its existence before then. Thus, it was simply unbelievable that the cure’s formula had been inside a book all along. Even Joachim hadn’t asked about the cure’s origins in case it was a sensitive topic, and he looked at Zich with disbelief. If Joachim felt this way even though he had great faith in Zich, how much more would Shalom be unconvinced?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Shalom continued the conversation with a smirk on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine! Let’s say that your ridiculous joke is true! Then what kind of book is that?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let me think… I saw the book so long ago that I can’t remember it well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you kidding me?!” Shalom shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His voice was so loud that it probably hurt his throat, but Zich responded by tilting his chin a bit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aren’t you the one joking? What do you want to hear? That I invented the medicine? Or that somebody told me the method to make it? If I say that, will it change anything?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What matters is that I created a cure for Igram, and people suffering from the disease became better. You can’t accept that I found the formula of the cure through a book, so how would you be able to accept any other explanation? Moreover, is there a reason for me to convince you by explaining each step of my process in finding the cure?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">you</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t grit your teeth. All it’ll do is wear down your teeth. I can’t prove my statement, and even if I could, I have no intention of convincing you by showing you evidence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because it didn’t matter whether or not people believed his words, Zich hadn’t prepared more than a shabby answer. More specifically, Zich knew that people wouldn’t accept whatever explanation he gave them. The cure for Igram was the creation of a collaborative effort of priests, doctors, and apothecaries. Who would simply believe that a common traveler like Zich knew the cure’s formula?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anyone would be suspicious. In truth, even Joachim doubted Zich.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If I say that I created the formula, they will definitely doubt me since my knowledge in physiology or medicine doesn’t go beyond an amateur level. And if I tell them a mysterious figure told me the formula, they will also not believe me. I mean, who would keep their identity a secret when they can get all kinds of wealth and honor for finding the cure?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich didn’t even want to try convincing someone who wouldn’t be convinced no matter what.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Whatever anyone says, I saw it in a book.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Who cares if they don’t believe me or not. And it’s not like I’m lying.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich saw the formula from a book that Joachim was reading before his regression, so he wasn’t even lying. Shalom’s face turned purple in rage like he wanted to kill Zich. However, Shalom repressed his emotions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fine. Then, did that book have cures for other infectious diseases?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, all I saw in that book was the cure for Igram.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘And this is also not a lie.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich knew the cure for other infectious diseases, but he had seen their formulas in other books. The book which talked about Igram’s cure only contained information about Igram.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Are you telling the truth?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come on, have you been tricked all your life?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shalom closely inspected Zich’s face, but Zich didn’t feel pressured by him. Furthermore, it wasn’t like he was lying, so Zich was confident in his words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With those words, Shalom disappeared without a farewell. Shalom’s actions were also incredibly rude to Joachim, who Shalom was supposed to serve, but Joachim seemed to be used to it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I apologize, Mr. Zich. A person from our family has caused you discomfort.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead of feeling upset by Shalom’s attitude towards him, Joachim apologetically bowed his head at Zich.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It doesn’t matter to me. But who is that man? I think I’ve seen him next to your older brother before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His name is Bessnol Shalom. He is our family’s butler.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He seems to have a lot of spirit for a butler.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shalom used to be our family knight. He used to be a skillful captain of our family’s Order of Knights. However, he had to retire because of a leg injury, and my father took Shalom in as our butler for his service.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich remembered how Shalom lightly limped; that was probably the aftereffects of Shalom’s leg injury.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why is a person like that fussing over me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He probably thought that I’ll gain greater authority if I successfully cure Igram in Ospurin. So, he probably came to pressure us while trying to grasp the current situation. You see, he is completely on my brother’s side,” Joachim said bitterly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Igram wasn’t simply controlled but cured, people’s interests would naturally lean towards Joachim, and that would be an eyesore to the forces supporting Biyom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘But how could he show that kind of attitude to someone who stopped an epidemic that could’ve swept across the entire city of Ospurin?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how much Joachim tried to understand Shalom’s behavior, he couldn’t. Even Joachim didn’t trust Zich about everything; he was especially curious about the cure’s origins. However, Zich was Ospurin’s savior, so Joachim looked at Zich favorably and couldn’t understand Shalom’s rude attitude.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he also had a similar thought as Shalom about one matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you really not know the cures for other infectious diseases?” Joachim asked while knowing that his question might be offensive to Zich. He wasn’t just asking for himself. If Zich knew the cures for other diseases, many more people could be saved. However, Zich shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That book really only had the formula to Igram’s cure.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich lied with a clever twist of his words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If I tell him that I know the cure to other infectious diseases right now, it will become really bothersome.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, since giving cures to diseases was also a kind act, Zich didn’t intend to keep the information to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I will tell Lubella some later.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Karuwiman could spread cures and medicines to places more efficiently than any other organization. Furthermore, since they owed him a favor, they would cover up his identity thoroughly. Zich didn’t intend to refuse fame if it was given to him, but he wasn’t so hungry for fame that he wanted it through cures that he didn’t create. He knew that the fame that he didn’t get by his own efforts would bring all kinds of baggage and nuisances.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s a pity, but I’m probably also being too greedy. It’s already a miracle that a cure for Igram was found.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim respected Zich’s privacy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that all you wanted to ask?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, it’s because Shalom insisted on talking to you. I’m so sorry for bothering you when you are busy making the cure. Feel free to leave now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That person named Shalom. How skilled is he?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim answered Zich’s question without much thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His abilities as a knight were greatly affected by his injury, but I heard that he is still a skilled fighter. His ability as a butler is also top-class. Since he has a good head on his shoulders, he handles our family’s matters well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If his head is good, he must also be good at trickery.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps, Zich had a grudge to settle. Joachim repressed his desire to sigh and nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, that is true.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for answering. Then I will leave now. I still have a lot of medicine to make.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I apologize again for this incident. I know I am shameless for asking you this, but please do all you can for the sick.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Joachim sent Zich off while bowing his head deeply, and Zich began to head back to the path he came from. While walking, Zich thought of Shalom again. He was a rude, old man—yet, what was more important to Zich was not the old man’s image.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Could he be Fest?’</span></p>
