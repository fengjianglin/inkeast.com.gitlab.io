 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Doing kind acts.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich walked towards Snoc and grabbed his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“It makes you uncomfortable that Nowem is being forgiven without any&nbsp;</span><span>consequences</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Then you just have to make him pay. Make him pay for his wrongs until both of you are satisfied.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you saying that he should pay for his wrongdoings by doing kind acts?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course. What is the first thing that criminals do when they atone for their sins in religious institutions? It’s helping others. Doing kind acts is one of the best ways to forgive yourself. There’s really nothing like it to cover your past wrongdoings.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam didn’t agree with the way Zich framed ‘helping others’ as if it was a tool, but Zich was not wrong. Sam began pondering again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In order for this to work, it’s most important for you to believe in it. No matter what others say, you have to believe this will work for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then are you telling Snoc to help orphanages or give to struggling people—things like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam blinked his eyes at Zich’s strong denial.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nowem is the one who did wrong. He has to use Nowem’s power.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem’s power. Sam trembled a bit as he recalled Snoc’s appearance when he went berserk. To him, the magical beast of the earth’s power was enormous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Then what should I do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc had been looking at Zich straight in the eyes since Zich mentioned ‘doing kind acts.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You told me you hated being a miner, right? You told me you wanted to go on an adventure.” Zich smirked. “Then do what you want.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you telling me to go on an adventure?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc and Sam were shocked by Zich’s unexpected answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But it’s too dangerous for Snoc! Didn’t you also say so in the past?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, but that was then. Now, he has Nowem.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Koo?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem’s face moved here and there as he heard his name being mentioned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If Snoc learns how to use Nowem’s powers properly, monsters in the mountainside or bandits in the streets would no longer pose a threat to him. Follow me. I can make it so that you can freely use your skills.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s ‘What you gonna do?’ attitude made Snoc also fall into deep thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not a bad offer. If he used Nowem’s strength to do kind acts, he felt that he could fully accept and forgive Nowem. Moreover, he’d be able to become the adventurer he had always dreamed about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc asked Nowem, “What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Koo!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem gave an affirmative answer. Even to people who could not understand him, they could see that he was fully supportive of Zich’s idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[After we fix this problem, let’s travel all around the world. Let’s do a lot of good deeds and change the song for the better.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem felt as if he could still hear his friend’s voice. Even though a long time had passed and she was no longer alive, Nowem could keep his promise with her if he traveled around. There was not a single reason for Nowem to refuse this offer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It’s been decided.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After he saw that Nowem was also supportive of his plan, Zich nodded his head. Even though Sam looked unsatisfied, he would agree with them in the end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Okay, I can end this matter for now. Let’s see, next…’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s gaze became sharp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I have to see how the assassin organization reacts.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The organization probably had an impressive information network. They knew about Snoc’s special mana properties and Nowem’s release from his seal. They were also able to use Drew to make Snoc and Nowem meet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘And that’s not only it.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how compatible Snoc and Nowem were, it was very rare for someone to know how to forcefully transfuse a human and a magical beast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It would be good if they try to retaliate from the corpses I spread around. It would also be good if the high officials in Suol find out anything from the assassin’s corpses.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But contrary to Zich’s hopes, the organization showed no signs of movement at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m going!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc waved his hands. Nowem, who was also in Snoc’s arms, also cutely squealed out ‘Koo!’ They stood on a street that was next to the city walls. Zich and Hans were finally able to leave Suol, and Sam came out to say goodbye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich stared at Snoc—his new traveling companion. Snoc looked as if he was overjoyed from being able to finally fulfill his dream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Now, he’s not going to become a Tyrant of the Earth anymore. With my intervention, history has changed.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich was satisfied despite not being able to fulfill his original mission of defeating the Tyrant of the Earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘The timing of when the Tyrant of the Earth comes out has passed. Since I stopped the Tyrant of the Earth from appearing and stopped Suol from being devastated, I definitely did a kind act.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And even in the rare chance that Snoc really did change into the Tyrant of the Earth later on, Zich could kill him at any moment—that was one of the reasons why Zich wanted to bring Snoc along.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘And I also got another baggage carrier.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Listen well to Zich and don’t cause trouble because you are too excited, okay?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam held onto Snoc and warned him about many different things. His expression seemed a bit sad. Zich thought Sam must be lonely now that his younger brother was going off into the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Zich didn’t intervene; this was something for Sam to solve by himself. It wasn’t Zich’s place to say anything when they were about to leave. For a while, Sam continued nagging and made sure that Snoc didn’t forget anything again and again. Even though Snoc tried to be patient since they wouldn’t be able to see each other for a while, he reached his limits. It was only after Snoc finally showed he was fed up that Sam stopped his endless nagging.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s get going now.” Zich said his farewell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for a lot of things. I’m fortunate to have a friend like you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’m a hard fortune to come across. You should be careful from now on. You might have used up all your luck to meet me, so now only misfortune might come to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will make sure to be careful.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam would even miss Zich’s playful boasts. Sam grabbed Zich’s hand and smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m leaving now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With these words, Zich left the city with Hans and Snoc. For a long time, Sam watched their backs move further away. Snoc turned back and met Sam’s eyes, and Hans also looked back once. But Zich did not turn back even once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam saw Hans say something to Zich. Was Hans telling Zich that he was still watching them? But then he saw Zich hit the back of Hans’ head. Even from a distance, it looked like a hard swing. Snoc flinched and Hans grabbed the back of his head and struggled to compose himself. But after that punch, Hans no longer looked back. Snoc also did not look back even once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘That cold-hearted punk.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Was that how travelers said their goodbyes? Sam put his hand on his hips and let out a sigh; then he smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I should get going.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam burned the image of Snoc clumsily walking away in his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Do you admire Zich?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam recalled a conversation he recently had with Snoc.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Yep. He’s a person I thought was only real in my dreams.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich was strong and free-spirited. Even though he said he was not an adventurer, the actions he showed to Sam and Snoc were enough to make Snoc’s heart quicken in excitement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[As we go through this journey, I’m planning to make him my role model.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I think that will be very hard.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Yeah, I also think so.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how many experiences he gained, it would be very hard for Snoc to become like Zich. But Snoc was not disheartened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[I finally have a way to make my dreams a reality. If I combine my strengths with Nowem’s, I think we can definitely fulfill my dreams of becoming an adventurer.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nowem made a loud cry and supported Snoc’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[If you think that, I have nothing more to say. I will cheer you on.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam no longer had anything to say against Snoc’s dreams. But he wanted to say at least this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[But try not to learn his attitude.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[…I don’t think I can learn his attitude even if I wanted to.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sam burst into laughter as he recalled Snoc’s silly expression. As if all the tumultuous events that happened recently were all lies, the vast sky above Suol was blue and perfectly clear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich’s group slowly walked down the street. Hans stared at their new companion. Snoc was looking around with sparkling eyes. Anyone could see that he was full of anticipation about their journey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘So pitiful.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Hans felt pity for him as he knew that Snoc’s excitement would be crushed in the near future. As Hans continued to look&nbsp;</span><span>at Snoc</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with pity, he also saw Nowem on Snoc’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I can’t believe that’s the magical beast of the earth.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The magical beast was the basis of Snoc’s strength when he went berserk. Hans gulped, thinking back on how he had to deal with Snoc during that time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It was really incredible.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though Hans had been burdened with Sam, Snoc was able to push Hans to the extremes. On the other hand, Zich easily defeated Snoc in his berserk mode. Recalling this memory, Hans was amazed at Zich. Then, he also remembered how Zich beat the crap out of Snoc without any hesitation and shivered at Zich’s awful personality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans had unconsciously started to stare at Zich. When Zich frowned, Hans jumped back in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><br>“I-I just…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he didn’t reply, he would be in bigger trouble. Hans decided to utilize recent incidents to make his excuse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it not a pity? Mr. Zich, other people won’t know the kind acts you did.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nice! Hans thought he made up a good excuse; he even used Zich’s obsession with doing kind acts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I mean… wasn’t what you did this time the same as protecting an entire city? If people found out about what you did, you would be praised by everyone in Suol.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They would praise Zich like the time Zich helped defeat the Bellid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘But I guess it can’t be helped.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans was the one who asked this question, but he knew what the answer would be. Snoc was related to this incident. In order to protect him, they had to make sure this incident didn’t come out and that was the type of answer Hans expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the answer that came out of Zich was completely different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t care about receiving praises.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><br>Hans blinked his eyes a few times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not doing this because I want to be praised. It doesn't matter to me whether or not people praise, envy, despise, or even hate me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T-then why are you doing kind acts?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zich started doing kind acts because of Glen Zenard’s last words to him. However, Glen’s words had only been a trigger. There was only one reason why Zich did kind acts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s because I want to.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no other reason than this. Hans was quiet. Zich’s commitment was like that of a righteous hero who helped others without wanting people’s praises or profit. Because of his playful attitude, Hans thought that Zich was just using his outrageous strength to ‘play hero’ like a child playing games. But maybe he had been wrong about Zich after all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then sir, you weren’t doing this with a light heart?” Hans asked carefully while gulping his saliva. As soon as he said these words out loud, he closed his eyes. It felt as if Zich was going to punch him at any moment. But Hans was much too curious about this question. Fortunately, a fist didn’t come flying towards him. Instead, Zich replied without much thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am doing this with a light heart.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘As expected.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Hans expected, Zich was just playing hero. He didn’t know why, but he was a bit disappointed at Zich. He pouted his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir, I’m envious of you. Because you are so strong, you are able to get into dangerous situations with a light heart.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he said this, Hans flinched. Because Zich wasn’t as harsh with him before and because of his disappointment, he spoke way more than he should have. Hans thought he would definitely get punched this time—no, it probably wouldn’t end with a punch. Hans filled with anxiety.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But what came back towards him wasn’t violence but a conversation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m not doing kind acts because I’m strong.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans stared at Zich.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve been getting involved with a lot of things, but I don’t think I’m the strongest yet. The guy who forcefully transfused Nowem and Snoc was honestly stronger than me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he was in his Demon Lord days, he would have said he was the strongest without a single moment of hesitation, but he was very “weak” right now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not because I’m strong. It’s because I want to do kind acts. Even if I meet my end doing this, I don’t care.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doing what he wanted… Even before he regressed, it was the one force that moved him. Zich didn’t speak with gravity or extravagance. Instead, his words were plain and simple. However, it was because he spoke so plainly that they sounded more honest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“…Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hans felt his heart quicken. It was the same feeling he got when his mom gave him the book about a hero’s journey. It was the same excitement he felt when he first read that book.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Snoc, who had been quietly listening, also looked excited, and his eyes sparkled again. He felt as if he had definitely picked the right person. Snoc also felt his heart beating faster and squeezed Nowem in his arms tightly.</span></p>
