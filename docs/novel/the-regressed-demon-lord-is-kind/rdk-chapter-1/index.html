 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, damn it.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In a children’s storybook that Zich read when he was little, there was a passage&nbsp;</span><span>that described</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;a great hero's fall.&nbsp;According to the passage, even the&nbsp;</span><span>h</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eavens filled with grief at the sight of the&nbsp;</span><span>dying hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and rain began to pour down from the sky.&nbsp;He didn’t know exactly why, but even a</span><span>fter</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;many years passed, this passage remained stuck inside his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As expected, the&nbsp;</span><span>h</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eavens don’t seem to love me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the bright sun without a cloud in sight, Zich was sure that the&nbsp;</span><span>h</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eavens must have despised him instead, let alone love a person like him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, it’s pretty understandable why.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich couldn’t even count the number of people who cried because of him or remember how many people he had killed. People called him the Demon Lord, who had brought chaos and despair into this world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn’t particularly like to dine on blood or flesh, but he also didn’t refuse it when they were offered; and he had lived a kind of life where he used whatever means to achieve a goal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If the&nbsp;</span><span>h</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eavens really loved him, they would’ve slapped Zich across the&nbsp;</span><span>face</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and told him to change his ways.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it over?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich heard a voice. It was such a heroic and noble voice that it was irritating.&nbsp;He lowered his gaze from the sky and looked forward.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A man wearing shiny armor looked down at Zich with a haughty look on his face. He was the man called ‘Hero&nbsp;</span><span>Among</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Heroes’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">With a cringy, almost disgusting, title called ‘The&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sun Warrior</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’, he was the human named&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Glen&nbsp;</span><span>Zenard</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So handsome.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich wished he could spit on a face like that at least once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Should I give it a try?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich considered the angle, his left-over stamina, the guy’s evasion speed, and so on—even in his dazed state, he was able to calculate these kinds of things fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, I shouldn’t.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was his end. Zich didn’t want to lose his cool at the last moment&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;something like this. He still had some pride,&nbsp;</span><span>since the people in this world</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;called him the Demon Lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, but wait. When did I have pride in something like that?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich was moving his mouth to&nbsp;</span><span>fire&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a spit right at the tip of Glen’s perfectly</span><span>-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">shaped, sculpted nose when Glen suddenly exclaimed—</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your evil deeds will come to an end now, Demon Lord Zich Moore!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What a cheesy line to say.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was uncreative. Really uncreative. As if he was really a hero from a storybook, Glen reiterated lines that only characters from a moldy, third-rate hero novel would say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shouldn’t he have stopped reading children’s storybooks by now?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Zich didn’t even have the strength to respond to him. He could only blink at the glorious hero before him and stare.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quickly finish him! Our opponent is the ‘Demon Lord of Strength’. We don’t know when he will regain his powers!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! That’s right!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, I don’t have any powers left. My body hurts, and I don’t want to move.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich wanted to explain this to the hero’s companions, who were telling the hero to finish him off.&nbsp;But it was tiring to even open his mouth. Furthermore, he wondered if there was any purpose in explaining this to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They can be on their guard if they wish.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He thought it was a bit funny&nbsp;</span><span>to see them</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;fuss over his dying body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, it also made him feel a bit pleased. Didn’t their words mean that he&nbsp;</span><span>posed a huge threat</span><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, he no longer has the power to harm us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich’s enjoyment suddenly evaporated with Glen’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This guy is really not fun.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I should</span><span>’ve tried to destroy him first instead of spending my time doing useless things</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich wasn’t thinking along the lines of, ‘</span><span>I</span><span style="font-weight: 400">f only I had gotten ridden of this guy, I…!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He just purely wanted to&nbsp;</span><span>tear</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;this annoying guy’s face apart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Slam!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero lifted his sword and pushed it up against Zich.&nbsp;The holy sword’s edges looked sharp enough to rip even a soul in half.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen, Zich Moore! Before you die, I will recite every evil deed you have committed!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What kind of bullshit is this?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero began to spout nonsense, and Zich looked at the companions around him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘To think that they hung around a guy like him. Indeed, they are very impressive guys.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Compared to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the giant fireballs that they shot at him, the shields that blocked his attacks, the arrows aimed at his vulnerable spots, or the miracles that had maxed out their companions’ skill stats or instantly healed their companies’ injuries, staying around a guy like this seemed more impressive to Zich than anything else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, it can’t be helped. I guess I have to listen to this.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if his opponents had formed a party to fight him, Zich couldn’t deny that he, who was called the ‘Demon Lord of Strength’, was defeated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What can a loser do but let the winner do as he pleases</span><span>?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich strained&nbsp;</span><span>to pry his</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;eyes open and stared at the hero. As if he was completely immersed in his role, Glen spat out words without even looking at Zich.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did he come here prepared</span><span>&nbsp;w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ith everything memorized?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If that was the case, Zich thought he should applaud Glen for his efforts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, wait. If I think about it, isn’t this something that should hurt my pride? He must have only thought of beating me.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, emotions began to erupt in Zich, but he repressed them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Forget it. It’s true that I lost.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If he won, it would’ve been different, but to get angry about something like this after losing would only make him seem like a sore loser.&nbsp;It was only appropriate that he should act like a loser if he lost. Thus, he la</span><span>y</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;down lifelessly and listened to his ‘</span><span>e</span><span style="font-weight: 400">vil&nbsp;</span><span>d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eeds’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, that’s right, something like that happened. Oh yeah, that too. This is&nbsp;</span><span>making me reminisce</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. He must have done a lot of research.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Like an old man&nbsp;</span><span>trapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;his past memories, Zich listened to all of the things he had done. They described a bloody path</span><span>&nbsp;which befitted</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;his nickname, ‘Demon Lord’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“…</span><span>W</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ith all of these sins in mind, I lay down my judgment of justice to the Demon Lord, Zich Moore!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What? It's already over?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich woke up from his pool of memories and nostalgia that the hero’s speech reinvigorated.&nbsp;He licked his lips in pity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I received quite a good gift on my way out.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This was really his end. Zich carefully scanned the figures around him again. The young magician was glaring at him with contempt</span><span>, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he swordsman was on guard to protect the hero if an emergency arose</span><span>, and t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he archer was also still on high alert with a cold-hearted face.&nbsp;The female saint was crying and praying for even a complete stranger like Zich. And finally, the hero was confidently holding his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero’s sword slowly rose above Zich, and he would die the moment it fell.&nbsp;Zich knew that he couldn’t escape his end. He didn’t even think about struggling to survive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He began to gather up the last remaining amount of power he had.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Since I am called the Demon Lord, I can’t just die.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the&nbsp;</span><span>other demon lords in</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;storybooks, he</span><span>&nbsp;cast a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;curse&nbsp;</span><span>on</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the hero.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the magic tools that he had collected while traveling&nbsp;</span><span>the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, there was an item that&nbsp;</span><span>had a similar effect to that of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;curse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They definitely said it was called ‘The Key that Distorts Destiny’.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the name of the small blade that he had inserted inside his index finger. It had been very troublesome for him to stick the thing inside his finger while not&nbsp;</span><span>experiencin</span><span style="font-weight: 400">g discomfort in his daily life.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But thanks to that, he now had the opportunity to give the last blow to his annoying opponent—making the trouble worth it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It wo</span><span>n’t be enough</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;to kill him.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">This item wasn’t for something like that, but for someone like Zich, who loved to fuck his opponents over, it really fitted him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s a small blade that can change the future of someone whose destiny&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ha</span><span>s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;changed. I don’t know how his future will change though.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">But it didn’t matter.&nbsp;All the other demon lords were already dead. It wasn’t hard to imagine that Glen Zen</span><span>ard</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, who had finally killed the last Demon Lord, Zich, would be guaranteed a heroic future.&nbsp;Even if Glen’s future changed for the better, it just meant that his already heroic future would shine a bit brighter.&nbsp;But if his future changed for the worse…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let’s take a test, hero. If you continue to walk a heroic path even if you get hit by this, it’s your win. But if the destiny you are about to&nbsp;</span><span>fac</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e is full of darkness, it will be more miserable than anyone else</span><span>’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich really hoped for Glen to meet the latter.&nbsp;The only regrettable thing&nbsp;</span><span>was that there was no way for him to see this happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you are born again, I hope that you will be someone who does good!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Like a judge giving his final judgement, Glen yelled while swinging his sword down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich, who had been lying down lifelessly suddenly got up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I get the chance, I will!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“But not now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Push!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Glen’s sword sliced across Zich’s body from his left shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even as his body was getting sliced, Zich focused all of his attention onto his index finger. Then, a sharp, gold piece steadily popped out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Glen looked surprised, and his companions moved in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But I’m faster!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Push!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a critical hit. Zich</span><span>&nbsp;was in bad condition</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, and Glen’s magic barrier was too strong for him to land a critical hit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">But due to Glen’s carelessness, the tiny blade that he had poured all of his power into was able to slide through the barrier and&nbsp;</span><span>leave</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;a small scratch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bastaaaaaard!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Glen’s&nbsp;</span><span>stone</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-like face crumpled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hahahahaha!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to Glen, Zich wanted to burst into laughter. But like a marionette&nbsp;</span><span>that</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;had lost all of&nbsp;</span><span>its</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;strings, he couldn’t move his body and face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Swing!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Glen’s body moved once again and sliced Zich’s neck off.&nbsp;Zich’s vision became dark.&nbsp;But before he completely lost&nbsp;</span><span>consciousness</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, he thought he saw something shining.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What! This…is…not pos…finally. Here…this time…perfect…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Glen was murmuring some things in terror, but Zich’s&nbsp;consciousness faded into darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was noisy outside. Zich scowled and turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, damn it! I can’t sleep with this noise…!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">After murmuring in annoyance, he stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He quickly got up. While surveying his surroundings with a stupid look on his face, the fearsome ‘Demon Lord of Strength’ was nowhere to be found. He actually looked like a blockhead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He began to touch his body all over. The wound that had been severe enough to cut him into two was entirely gone.&nbsp;There was not even a scratch; his skin that&nbsp;</span><span>was rough</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;from battle now felt soft and smooth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he touched his neck. It had been completely severed;</span><span>&nbsp;no one</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;could’ve reversed it unless they were a god. But unbelievably, his head was s</span><span>till attached to</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;his body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What in the world!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he had experienced the world to its fullest and went through all kinds of experiences to the point that he earned the title of the Demon Lord; he had never gone through anything like this.&nbsp;He wondered for a moment if his stats disappeared and tried to calm himself to figure out the situation for now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘At least I am alive.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He couldn’t believe it yet, but that was the important part. The future that had been closed&nbsp;</span><span>off for him had</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;opened again.&nbsp;Although he had reluctantly accepted his death, it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t be happy to be alive again. Zich felt better after he rechecked himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Flap!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He took off the thing covering him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s a blanket.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a soft,&nbsp;</span><span>throw</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;blanket of high quality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he looked around his surroundings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span>H</span><span style="font-weight: 400">e was lying on top of a bed in some kind of room.&nbsp;There were many luxurious and high-quality furniture in the wide room. It didn’t seem like a typical family room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It somehow feels pretty familiar.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich got off his bed and began to explore the room.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He passed</span><span>&nbsp;by a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;mirror that was hanging on a wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Zich marched towards the mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It was definitely Zich’s face, but also not at the same time.&nbsp;He rubbed his cheeks and scratched a pimple&nbsp;</span><span>that had claimed a visible spot&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I became younger?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As Zich screamed, the face&nbsp;</span><span>i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n the mirror,&nbsp;</span><span>which copied</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;the shape of his mouth, was that of his younger self.</span></p>
