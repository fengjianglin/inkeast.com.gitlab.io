 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pure and bright young woman that wore a green dress, had jet black hair, and crystalline eyes, and she was like a hill that turned green after the rain and emanated a refreshing and beautiful aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her cherry lips were red and rosy, her skin fair and supple, and the graceful bearing she revealed as she moved over nimbly instantly drew the attention of many students in the surroundings. All of them felt their breath being taken away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Chen Xi instantly started smiling when he saw this young woman, and a wisp of the warmth of reunion surged into his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young woman was naturally A’xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her full name was Xuanyuan Xiu, and she was a direct descendant of one of the seven great ancient clans, the Xuanyuan Clan. Moreover, she was the most dazzling genius in the younger generation of the Xuanyuan Clan besides Xuanyuan Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason was that she’d inherited the might of a primeval divine weapon, the Xuanyuan Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, we meet again.” A’xiu smiled brilliantly and revealed a mouthful of snow white teeth that seemed like pearls. She was dazzlingly beautiful, and the smile she revealed at that instant caused the entire heavens and the earth to dim in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hey…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard this familiar form of address, besides laughing bitterly, Chen Xi noticed to his relief that A’xiu really was like before, and she hadn’t changed much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Gu Yueming, Liang Ren, Mu Yuchong, and the others opened their eyes wide. Never had they imagined that Chen Xi really knew the little princess of the Xuanyuan Clan, and it seemed like they had a rather good relationship…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did your clan’s little princess get to know Chen Xi?” Mu Yuchong couldn’t refrain from sending a voice transmission to Xuanyuan Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would also like to ask you how your clan’s Eldest Young Miss Linglong got to know Chen Xi?” Xuanyuan Yun was stunned, and then he replied with a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, both of them glanced at each other and felt speechless because they noticed that both Xuanyuan Xiu and Mu Linglong seemed to have good relationships with Chen Xi, but it just so happened that both of them didn’t know how Chen Xi got to know the Eldest Young Misses of their two clans…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s Ling Bai? Where’s Bai Kui? Where’s Mu Kui? What about Mortis and A’Man? Why aren’t all of them with you? Oh, right, their strengths are insufficient, so they were naturally unable to ascend to the Immortal Dimension.” A’xiu was obviously very happy when she saw Chen Xi, and she jabbered on without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi knew that A’xiu had a lot to say because she hadn’t seen him for a very long time, and she didn’t really need him to answer her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this entire process, Chen Xi found out that A’xiu had actually become the personal disciple of Wang Daolu, and she was cultivating at Wang Daolu’s side now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In name, A’xiu was already considered to be a student of the inner court.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh with emotion because of this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I took great pains and exerted extraordinary effort to pass the three rounds of &nbsp;the test and enter the academy to become a student of the outer court, but A’xiu didn’t even participate in any tests yet had directly become a student of the inner court and the personal disciple of the inner court’s Head Instructor Wang Daolu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, it wasn’t just A’xiu who was like this. For example, the Zuoqiu Clan’s Zuoqiu Ke and the Mu Clan’s Mu Linglong had both entered the academy through special methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Later on, Chen Xi found out that when dealing with top powers like the seven great ancient clans, Dao Emperor Academy would give each clan a special slot to enter the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This slot wasn’t given out casually, and there were many requisites to obtain it. If it wasn’t one who possessed the best natural talent and natural endowment, then even if they obtained this quota, the student would be refused by the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the reality in Dao Emperor Academy. They provided the quota, yet not just anyone was qualified to obtain it. If one wanted to enter the academy, that person had to obtain the acknowledgement of the academy first!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, A’xiu didn’t just obtain this quota, she even became the personal disciple of the Half-step Immortal King, Wang Daolu, because of her extraordinary natural talent. As for Mu Linglong and Zuoqiu Ke, they were presumably the same as A’xiu, and they entered Dao Emperor Academy through this special quota.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After catching up with Chen Xi, A’xiu asked abruptly. “I heard that someone came looking for trouble with you earlier?” As she spoke, her beautiful brows knit together, and she revealed a wisp of anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi said with a smile, “It has already been dealt with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t want to involve A’xiu because in that way, it would make him, Chen Xi, seem too useless. It was better to resolve some things on his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, A’xiu wasn’t satisfied with this answer. She raised her hand to call Xuanyuan Yun over and said, “13</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Cousin Brother, tell me what happened earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Yun didn’t conceal anything and spoke about it in detail. He didn’t exaggerate at all and only spoke about the situation earlier in a concise manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Zuoqiu Clan, huh?” A’xiu puckered her lips and said with a murderous air, “13</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Cousin Brother, go notify the experts of out Xuanyuan Clan in the inner court. Tell them the Zuoqiu Clan bullied me and ask them to come over at once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words were spoken too ferociously, and it caused Liang Ren and Gu Yueming to be extremely astounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My god! This little princess of the Xuanyuan Clan looks to be pure and bright, yet her nature is really overbearing indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Yun was stunned. “Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu said with displeasure, “Do I look like I’m joking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw A’xiu seemed to be on the verge of flaring up, Xuanyuan Yun said hastily, “I’ll go right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait!” Chen Xi stopped Xuanyuan Yun. “Blowing up this matter isn’t beneficial to anyone. I think we should just forget it, and I’ll deal with it myself when I have the chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was calm, yet revealed an indisputable tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it, we’ll spare those bastards that don’t know what’s good for them this time.” A’xiu puckered her lips and could only drop it. She was very well aware of Chen Xi’s character, and she knew that once he made a decision, then it was impossible to change it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commotion caused by A’xiu wasn’t just heard clearly by Chen Xi and the others, even some of the nearby students that were leaving had heard it clearly, and all of them were extremely shocked in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had expected that this little princess of the Xuanyuan Clan would be so protective of Chen Xi. Coupled with Mu Yuchong and Ji Xuanbing standing up for Chen Xi earlier, it meant that at least three of the seven great ancient clans rather cared for Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the union of the Zuoqiu Clan, Dragon Dimension, and Jiang Clan was a force that couldn’t be underestimated as well. In the future, if a conflict erupted between them and Chen Xi once more, then the scene would probably be extremely magnificent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also from this moment onward that many people started to take Chen Xi seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was already the first amongst the new students this year, and he received the attention of numerous great figures in the academy. Now that he’d formed friendly relations with ancient clans like the Xuanyuan Clan, Mu Clan, and Ji Clan, he seemed like a star that was rising slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he really steadied himself within the academy, then probably no one would dare willfully provoke him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you intend to do next?” A’xiu asked about Chen Xi’s plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the inner court exam was in two years of time while Chen Xi was only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. If he was unable to advance into the Golden Immortal Realm during this period of time and be ranked in the top fifty of the Allheaven Golden Rankings, then he wouldn’t have the chance to participate in the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Earn Starpoints.” Chen Xi answered without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he possessed the Manor, Chen Xi wasn’t worried about being unable to advance into the Golden Immortal Realm within two years, and the truly troublesome thing to him and earning Starpoints instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was determined to obtain the River Diagram fragment and Chaos Quintessence Fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I understand now.” A’xiu’s eyes spun as she chuckled and said, “You’re worried that you wouldn’t have sufficient Starpoints when you bash up those disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was astounded. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re fighting, so Starpoints will naturally be deducted from you. Bashing a single person is ten thousand Starpoints. There are so many disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan in the academy, so you naturally have to prepare even more Starpoints so that it’s convenient for you to bash them up every time you see them in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu chuckled and said, “My Master once asked me what’s the greatest in the academy? It isn’t principles, nor rules, and it’s Starpoints! Before Starpoints, all laws, rules, principles… Everything is like a cloud that can be utterly disregarded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned. Never had he imagined that as one of the head instructors in the inner court, Wang Daolu would actually speak such ‘truths’ to A’xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when he thought about it, it was indeed like this. Even a precious treasure of the three dimensions like the River Diagram fragment could be obtained in exchange for Starpoints, and this obviously showed what extraordinary meaning Starpoints carried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you intend to earn Starpoints, then I have a good idea that’s able to allow you to earn Starpoints every single day.” A’xiu gazed at Chen Xi and seemed to be lost in thought as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s spirits were refreshed. He was worried about this matter, yet he never expected that A’xiu’s assistance would be so timely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What method is it?” At this moment, even Liang Ren, Gu Yueming, Xuanyuan Yun, and Mu Yuchong who were listening from the side had become interested. They’d just stepped into the academy for a single day and weren’t familiar with everything in it. So, it was naturally extremely good if they were able to obtain the guidance of a ‘senior’ like A’xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu said, “Since it’s like this, then let’s all go together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, A’xiu turned around and flashed towards the distance while everyone else hurriedly followed behind her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao Emperor Academy established within a space that was created by the Dao Emperor. Mountains covered it densely while ancient buildings could be seen everywhere, and its boundaries seemed to be without end, causing it to be extremely vast and grand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In short, Dao Emperor Academy was divided into five areas, &nbsp;the inner court, outer court, Scripture Reserve, Pill Reserve, and Dao Development Reserve. Every single area was like a small world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was even to the extent that for the sake of the convenience of the academy’s students while moving about between these areas, the great figures of the academy had established teleportation formations between these five areas, and this obviously showed exactly how enormous the academy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu led Chen Xi and the others into a teleportation formation, and in the next moment, they were teleported before an extremely lofty mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountain was covered in row upon row of ancient halls that started from the foot of the mountain and stretched until the peak. When looked at from afar, it just happened to seem like a kingdom built on a mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the mountain was extremely bustling as numerous figures moved about on it in streaks that tore through the sky, and it was extremely gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This seems to be…” Mu Yuchong was uncertain and seemed to have recognized something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly, this is where the assignments of the academy are issued and received. Its name is very simple, it’s called Assignment Mountain. Every single hall distributed on the mountain will have various different assignments issued from it every single day.” As she spoke, A’xiu had led Chen Xi and the others up the mountain. “The assignments here are boundless like an ocean. I’ll take all of you to verify your identities first. In the future, all of you can rely on your Violet Ribbon Starcrest to look through all the new assignments issued every single day on Assignment Mountain without leaving your abodes…”</span></p>
