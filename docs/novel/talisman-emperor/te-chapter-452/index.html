 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi and the others were flying in midair. Since they charged through the line of defense of the Savage Hummingbirds, they’d encountered numerous formidable demon beasts all along the way, and there were even existences on par with Violent Waterflame Apes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, Ironhide Ghostfishes, Three-headed Jade Turtles, Devilflame Horned Sharks, and so on and so forth. But their numbers weren’t great, whereas Chen Xi and the others didn’t get locked in battle for too long, and they charged and killed all along the way to forcefully slaughter out a bloodied path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even then, Chen Xi still obtained a great amount of benefit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The skin, fur, bones, and Origin Pearls within the bodies of these sea demons were extremely valuable and precious materials. Some could be refined into spirit pills, some could be used for equipment refinement, and they possessed numerous usages. Amongst them, Chen Xi had gathered numerous materials that were capable of improving the quality of the Talisman Armament, so it could be considered to be a good harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when the Talisman Armament’s quality was improved once more, its might would be comparable to a top-grade heaven-rank magic treasure or even a Quasi Immortal Artifact, and because of this, it had extremely harsh requirements towards the various materials that were needed. Not only was the number of materials needed enormous, even the requirement of quality was extremely high. After gathering all along the way, Chen Xi had only gathered one tenth of the various materials that were needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Chen Xi could be considered to have truly experienced the dangers of the Primitive Sea. Countless sea demons of all sorts formed large groups that covered a large expanse that was like a dense mass of darkness, and they numbered in the thousands, ten thousands, or even hundred thousands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the deeper they ventured into the Primitive Sea, the strengths of the sea demons that appeared grew stronger, and Chen Xi had even noticed many terrifying overlord level sea demons that possessed auras that were like bottomless chasms and were simply comparable to Earthly Immortal Realm experts in terms of strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they noticed these extremely dangerous existences, Chen Xi and the others avoided them as soon as possible and went around them. Fortunately, these overlord level sea demons seemed to be cultivating in seclusion and couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to little fish like them, so they were only shocked, yet didn’t suffer any danger nor lethal attacks all along the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they went deeper into the Primitive Sea, a strange treasure had appeared in the hands of the Darjin Dynasty’s Crown Prince, Pei Yu. It was palm sized and seemed like the shell of a turtle, and its surface had numerous strange talisman markings inscribed on it, causing it to seem like a compass. Pei Yu had relied on this treasure to lead everyone in the boundless sea to find the Isle of Fallen Treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve finally arrived at the Isle of Fallen Treasure!” Suddenly, Pei Yu stopped moving and raised his head to look into the distance, and his voice revealed a race trace of excitement and happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirits of the others were refreshed when they heard this, and then they raised their eyes to look into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bum! Brrum! Bruuuuuummm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had just spread out his Divine Sense when he sensed countless desolate sounds that were like war horns and a piercingly cold iron blooded aura of battle coming out from the distant surface of the sea. It seemed as if the gods of ancient times were at battle, and it shook his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">We’ve finally arrived at the Isle of Fallen Treasures!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their group had travelled in the Primitive Sea for around a few days and nights, and they’d experienced countless dangers before arriving at this mysterious Isle of Fallen Treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Isle of Fallen Treasures was enveloped in a layer of dense mist that drifted in the surroundings while staying extremely condensed and showing no signs of dissipating, and it caused them to be unable to clearly see if the isle really existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was said to be an isle, yet it was no different than a continent that floated on the surface of the sea as one couldn’t see the end of the isle with a single glance, and it at least covered an area of a few hundreds of thousands of kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gales and violent waves whistled past, causing the mist above the Isle of Fallen Treasures to drift indeterminately, yet it didn’t dissipate from the beginning until the end, and it seemed as if the isle would forever stay extremely mysterious and be enveloped within the mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of desolate war horns, the furious shouts of the gods that shook the heavens, and miserable howls that caused one’s scalp to go numb could be faintly heard, and it put a terrifying veil on the Isle of Fallen Treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to rumor, not only are there numerous treasures and the shattered pieces of things left behind by the fallen gods, there are numerous extremely formidable demons concealed on the Isle of the Fallen Treasures. There are even ancient souls of the dead drifting within the isle, causing it to be extremely dangerous and terrifying. Once we enter the isle, everyone must be sure to be careful.” Pei Yu’s expression had become completely serious as an extremely sharp and pure golden ray of sword light floated out into appearance and guarded in his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of the others became apprehensive when they heard this, and more than half of the excitement and delight on their faces vanished as they became completely on guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. The experts of other Dynasties have probably entered the isle long ago. Once we enter the isle, we’ll be unable to avoid some competition from occurring. So everyone must be united and not give others an opportunity to take advantage of.” Pei Yu glanced at everyone and especially took a second glance at Chen Xi before turning around and charging towards the distant isle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi thought for a moment and decided to temporarily stay in Pei Yu’s group. After all, this fellow seemed to be rather knowledgeable about the Isle of Fallen Treasure, so it wouldn’t be late for them to leave after they entered with him and familiarized themselves with the situation in the isle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, they’d passed through the roiling and dense mist to arrive on the Isle of Fallen Treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This isle had no plants and lacked vitality, the ground was crimson red as if it had once been tainted with fresh blood, and everywhere the eye could see was like ruins after a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this place wasn’t silent. Within the coiling mist was the flickering light of treasures and overflowing divine lights, and it seemed to contain countless treasures, causing the isle to seem like a forgotten place that was filled with treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a door that was formed from two majestic and large mountains. The area within it was cast and covered with layers of mist that enveloped most of the ruins, causing one to be unable to see exactly what was within. But there were numerous dazzling glows of treasures that whistled in the air and charged out frequently from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, those dazzling glows of treasures seemed to be from the treasures left behind by the ancient gods during their expedition in the legend, and the glows of treasures seemed like rain droplets that covered the sky and seemed to possess intelligence as they tempted the hearts of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were many people gathered outside the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, these people were extremely numerous. All of them were extremely young in appearance, and they were in groups of two to five and scattered all around the mountain door. Obviously, all of them were genius experts from the various Dynasties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi and the others arrived, they saw this extremely magnificent scene. Dense mist enveloped the area within the mountain door as the glow of treasures frequently flashed by, whereas outside the mountain door was numerous young geniuses that walked about and seemed to be unable to decide whether to enter or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Snowray Dynasty, the Eagle Dynasty, the Century Pool Dynasty, the Darqin Dynasty… There are so many genius experts!” When they arrived here, Young Master Zhou felt his eyes were insufficient to take in everything here, and at the same time, he wasn’t so arrogant anymore and didn’t go beyond his bounds. Because there were numerous geniuses here, and all of them were extremely formidable and emitted auras that caused his heart to palpitate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi marveled at it as well. The scene of so many genius experts gathered together was rather magnificent indeed, and it gave one an extremely strong visual impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, quickly! That group of fellows are actually demon cultivators with pure bloodlines and formidable auras. Could it be that they’re the descendants of ferocious beasts of the primordial era?” Young Master Zhou spoke out with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi raised his eyes to look over. Sure enough, he saw a few young men in the distance that were covered in surging demonic qi. Their demonic qi coiled in midair and faintly formed the appearance of various formidable creatures. One was a golden and enormous bird, one was a white colored liger, one was a bronze colored divine ant, and so on and so forth. All of them were the appearances of rare ferocious beasts of the primordial era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These demon cultivators ought to be the genius experts from the Century Pool Dynasty, as it’s a Dynasty of demon cultivators. There are numerous rivers and lakes within the Century Pool Dynasty, allowing infinite amounts of beasts to reside there. But since these demon cultivators were able to enter the Primeval Battlefield, they obviously possess extremely noble ferocious beast bloodlines, and their strength can’t be underestimated.” Chen Xi was extremely shocked in his heart.</span></p>
