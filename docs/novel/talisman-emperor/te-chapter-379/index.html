 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest Senior Brother, it’s that kid.” Cui Tie looked at Chen Xi’s figure with an expression of hatred, and he gnashed his teeth and said, “At that time, if it wasn’t for him interfering suddenly, I and Junior Brother Cheng Yun would have annihilated that she-devil!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Eldest Senior Brother. The set of flying swords Master passed down to me were completely destroyed at the hands of that kid. You must take revenge for me.” Cheng Yun chimed in from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the side of them was a young man in multicolored clothes that had a feminine appearance, and he swept the two of them with his gaze and grunted coldly when he heard this. “Who can you blame for possessing inferior skill?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cui Tie and Cheng Yun’s expression became extremely unsightly. But they knew that even though the words of their Eldest Senior Brother, Qiu Xiaofeng, were blunt, he would absolutely not disregard the matters of his junior brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention that she-devil was the common enemy of their Jadepool Dao Sect, so how could Qiu Xiaofeng not lift a finger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, just as both of them thought, Qiu Xiaofeng pondered briefly before he said coldly, “Presently, both of them have already charged into the waterfall, and they’ll probably be blasted out and eliminated before they seized the tokens. Of course, for the sake of avoiding anything unexpected from happening, I’ll wait for an opportunity to make a move, and I’ll absolutely not watch idly by as they smoothly get through the test!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With Eldest Senior Brother making a move, wouldn’t it be as easy as taking candy from a baby?” Cui Tie and Cheng Yun were greatly delighted. In their hearts, their Eldest Senior brother, Qiu Xiaofeng, was a top expert that was completely capable of comparing with Qing Xiuyi and the others, and the reason he was waiting here and hadn’t made a move to seize a Martial Dao Token for such a long time was because he couldn’t bear to leave first, as he wanted to look after his junior brothers. Otherwise, with his cultivation, he’d probably have passed this test long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Xiaofeng smiled lightly and didn’t say anything as his eyes looked towards the waterfall and locked tightly onto Chen Xi’s figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The waterfall formed from the energies of countless Dao Insights surged down like an explosive mountain torrent, and it emitted thunderous rumbling as it moved with shocking impetus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one was amidst the waterfall, so long as one was struck by a single water column, then it would likely affect one’s speed before causing one to be enveloped by the countless nearby water columns, and in the end, one would be blasted flying from there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dense and endless water columns struck down extremely swiftly, and they were exceedingly terrifying. They seemed as if they’d interweaved to form a large net, and if one wanted to obtain a Martial Dao Token from it, the chances were extremely tiny to the point of causing one to feel despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, there were patterns to follow as well. For example, after dense attacks continued in a certain area for a period of time, then it would slow down in the next moment and become scarce, leaving behind a fleeting safe area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many participants before this had relied on this pattern to grab the fleeting opportunity and safely obtained a token to pass through the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But to participants with slightly inferior discerning ability, speed, and mental accomplishments, it was greatly difficult. Some people had clearly found the pattern, yet because of various problems that arose from themselves, they made mistakes and were eliminated in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, within the surging and roaring waterfall, Chen Xi’s figure was like a dreamlike illusion as he moved through it. Even if he was carrying Fan Yunlan, his movement speed was still agile like a sparrow and swift like a bolt of lightning. Every single time everyone thought he would be struck by the water column, they would notice that the water column had merely struck the afterimage left behind by his extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, even if he was under the water column attacks that covered the heavens and the earth, Chen Xi still maintained an absolutely swift speed. Under this matchlessly strong visual impact, the nearby cultivators had the misconception that the water columns’ speed of striking had slowed down greatly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AH!” A cultivator had just entered the waterfall before being blasted flying, and he was precisely one of the people that thought the speed of the water columns had slowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone instantly became vigilant when they saw this scene.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It isn’t the water columns’ speed that has slowed down. It’s obviously Chen Xi that’s too swift and caused such a visual misconception to arise, and this is why the speed of the water columns seemed to have slowed down greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is carrying a person yet is still able to achieve this. Perhaps he’ll really be able to smoothly pass through this test…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present looked at each other, and their thoughts of wanting to see Chen Xi make a fool of himself weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had a concentrated expression as he moved endlessly through the waterfall. Even though a Martial Dao Token frequently flashed in the waterfall, due to the distance and the denseness of the water columns being too great, it wasn’t such an easy thing to smoothly seize a token.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, Chen Xi still had to help Fan Yunlan seize a token. In other words, he had to obtain two Martial Dao Tokens at the exact same time! So the difficulty had undoubtedly increased greatly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, for safety’s sake, even though he was ceaselessly moving through the waterfall, he still hadn’t made a move, and it was because he was waiting for a superb opportunity to seize two tokens at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, Chen Xi finally found this opportunity. In his field of vision, two Martial Dao Tokens were like two fishes that were swimming side by side as they flashed out from the depths of the waterfall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi who’d been accumulating strength while waiting to make a move since long ago had moved out valiantly. The Starsky Wings were exerted to the limit, causing a pair of faintly visible divine wings that were covered in stars to appear indistinctly behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at the instant he made a move, a wave of terrifying air waves came fiercely from behind him, and he was even able to hear an extremely sharp sound from space being torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone is making a move against me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes squinted as a trace of ghastly killing intent flashed past within it. He’d found this opportunity with great difficulty yet was disturbed by another, and a strand of fury couldn’t help but gush out from his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most vexing to him was that this attack didn’t strike just for the sake of stopping him from seizing the tokens; most importantly, the target of this ruthless and atrocious attack was actually Fan Yunlan who was on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was just him, he would naturally be unafraid of an attack like this, but because of Fan Yunlan, he had no choice but to temporarily give up seizing the tokens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being disturbed at the critical moment caused Chen Xi to arouse killing intent in his heart, and practically at the instant he noticed the attack that assaulted him from behind, he’d made a decision as he lightly flashed to the side like an agile serpent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when he’d just dodged away, an enormous True Essence palm print tore through the sky and fiercely blasted onto the waterfall, shattering over a thousand water columns and causing balls of water that were like snowy foam to explode out in the sky, and its impetus was shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi practically instantly determined that the strength contained within this strike was extremely strong, and if it struck onto Fan Yunlan, then she’d be heavily injured even if she escaped death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This estimation caused the flames of rage in his heart to become even more exuberant.</span></p>

He wore multicolored clothes and had a feminine appearance, and he was precisely the Jadepool Dao Sect’s Qiu Xiaofeng.</span></p>

This clearly revealed his extremely terrifying strength.</span></p>

The timing Eldest Senior Brother chose can be said to be extremely experienced, and only one with his level of strength would be capable of doing this flawlessly.”</span></p>

I made a move earlier only for the sake of apprehending that she-devil, and I have no intention of becoming enemies with Fellow Daoist. I presume you’ve discerned that my strike from before had no intention of harming you. I hope that Fellow Daoist can put that she-devil down and don’t implicate your own life because of this.” Qiu Xiaofeng spoke with confidence and composure in a clear voice, and he seemed to be rather extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yunlan’s gorgeous eyes went cold as she spoke first with a cold voice. “Chen Xi, put me down. I’ll deal with this despicable dog! He took advantage of the moment we were off guard to launch a surprise attack, yet still boasts shamelessly. He truly deserves death!”</span></p>

Dealing with him is only a matter of seconds. There’s utterly no need to go to such trouble.”</span></p>

I’ll give you one last chance. Put down the she-devil and I’ll let bygones be bygones. Otherwise, I’ll eliminate devils and send both of you on your way today!”</span></p>

He used his actions to proclaim battle!</span></p>

It seemed as if so long as Chen Xi was present, then it wouldn’t be terrifying even if the sky collapsed.</span></p>

Taking advantage of another’s perilous state to launch a surprise attack. Why are all the cultivators of the current younger generation more despicable and shameless than the other? Could it be that they don’t have the slightest integrity and poise?”&nbsp;</span></p>
