 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was terrified because this strike was too terrifying, and ordinary Earthly Immortal Realm experts would be whipped by this strike to the point their flesh and skin split apart before they were obliterated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The apertures on his entire body opened up like hedgehog that was revealing its spines, and his entire body erupted with numerous fierce sword qi that deduced creation and developed a myriad of profundities. It directly minced this whipping strike into pieces while numerous strands of sword qi amongst them shot at Bei Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Huang’s face went grim, and he didn’t dare take it head on, so he retreated hastily and avoided it. The consequences Huai Ming faced earlier were still vivid in his mind, so how could he possibly dare resist this terrifying sword qi head on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was shocked when they saw this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a heaven defying young man. He has fallen deeply into a hopeless situation yet is still capable of launching an overbearing counterattack. Exactly how formidable is his strength!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! What a desperate struggle! Let me see how long you can struggle for!” Priest Zi Yun’s eyes were filled with a cold expression as he urged the Prime Blood God Flags to transform into a bloody screen that covered the sky, and then they pressed down in unison from the positions of the five elements towards Chen Xi who was in the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This expanse of the heavens and the earth were completely blood red. Chilly winds billowed, vengeful spirits wailed, boundless blood surged, and the glow of sin flowed about, causing it to seem to have transformed into a hell of blood. The world was confined, and the pressure emanated onto the world multiplied explosively!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others didn’t feel anything, but this pressure affected Chen Xi like a large mountain pressing down onto an ant, and it was terrifying to the extreme, causing his blood, skin, and bones to seem to be on the verge of exploding apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged as the strange expression on his face grew deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Priest Zi Yun smiled lightly and felt victory was within his grasp. He waved the snow white horsetail brush in his hand, causing a blood red thunderbolt to be struck out and tear through the sky as it struck at Chen Xi with the intention of crippling Chen Xi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Yong, can you break through these Prime Flame God Flags? Otherwise, Chen Xi will be in danger!” Baili Yan spoke with a low voice while she revealed an expression of extreme anxiousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s difficult to achieve unless we utilize an Immortal Artifact like the Eternal Bell of Kings because even though these Prime Flame God Flags are copies, their combined might is no different from a Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact. But Princess, we didn’t bring along such a divine weapon when we come out this time.” The nearby old servant shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Brother, you’re still too young and haven’t matured, yet you dared boast about enforcing justice on behalf of the heavens? Even I can’t bear the sight of it, so I can only destroy your cultivation and give you a lesson that’s impossible to forget for your entire life.” Priest Zi Yun grinned as he spoke with a kind and benevolent expression, yet his movements weren’t slow in the slightest, and he caused the blood red thunderbolt to slash down while boundless lightning enveloped Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s entire body rumbled. “Old goat, do you think you’re really all-powerful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Accompanying his voice was a lofty aura of light that surged out abruptly from his body, and unlike normal light, this light had a deep, solemn, and vast aura!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, numerous vortexes revolved and rumbled on the surface of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone noticed to their shock that the blood, sin, and even vengeful spirits surging out from the Prime Blood God Flags were devoured by the vortexes and before merging into Chen Xi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous Rocs seemed to be whistling about within those vortexes, and they charged into the nine heavens and wandered the universe. Moreover, an ancient book that was glowing faintly appeared briefly even deeper within the vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the miraculous scene caused by the combination of the Netherworld Register and Stellar Lightningform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Register was an extremely mysterious book that came from the Netherworld. It was inherited from the third Netherworld Emperor from the Primordial Era, and it was the supreme divine book of the Netherworld. At the same time, it was a precious treasure that surpassed the might of nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A very long time ago, Ji Yu had once said that the third Netherworld Emperor was absolutely a great figure that roamed freely through the ages and shocked the three dimensions. Moreover, he controlled the six paths of reincarnation and had once discussed the Dao for 10 years without losing against the master of the Mansion, Fuxi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had lofty aspirations and intended to bury the gods, annihilate the devils, and reconstruct the order of the laws in the three dimensions, so he could give the myriad of worlds a flourishing age of peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was precisely because of this that he’d enraged the gods and devils of the three dimensions, causing him to be jointly annihilated by them, and he died with hatred in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Netherworld Register was just like the Condemn Evil Brush, both of them were treasures utilized by the Netherworld Emperor when he roamed the world, and they were peerlessly sharp weapons to slaughter evil and devils. The Netherworld Register formed a world of its own within it. It formed the path illuminated by fire with Paramita Flowers, used the muddy sea of bitterness to link up the other side, whereas the other side were the six paths of reincarnation of the Netherworld.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the Netherworld Register and Condemn Evil Brush complimented each other. The Condemn Evil Brush managed life and death, whereas the Netherworld Register managed leading souls to the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any dead soul that was killed by the Condemn Evil Brush would have its sins purified by the Netherworld Register before its crimes would be determined by the order in the Netherworld Register. After that, it would be lead to the six paths of reincarnation to be reborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, when Chen Xi suffered the suppression of the Prime Blood God Flags, the Netherworld Register had suddenly emitted fluctuations that caused him to instantly realize that the Netherworld Register was an existence that innately countered this evil treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Chen Xi took the opportunity to circulate the Stellar Lightningform and devoured the energy within the Prime Blood God Flags. Sure enough, the pressure that surrounded his body started to reduce greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he was able to notice clearly that expanse after expanse of Goldlight of Virtue was surging into appearance within his Blackhole World, and it was like golden flowers were descending from the sky, causing his energy of virtue to increase swiftly while the cultivation of his Dao Heart rose along with this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that he was able to clear sense the existence of the ‘mysterious energy from his Dao Heart’!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely an unexpected gain. The reason was very simple, the Prime Blood God Flags had been refined by Priest Zi Yun for a few thousands of years, and the sin, vengeful spirits, and blood contained within it were practically monstrous and like an ocean. After it was absorbed by the Netherworld Register, the energy of sin was dissolved while the vengeful souls were led to reincarnation, causing this energy of virtue to naturally be given to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, I underestimated you,” said Priest Zi Yun. That blood colored thunderbolt he struck out had been completely absorbed and merged into Chen Xi’s body, causing Chen Xi’s imposing aura to rise swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit, dammit! This little brat is actually devouring the energy of my Prime Blood God Flags!” After that, Priest Zi Yun noticed something was off, and his expression instantly turned extremely gloomy while he was furious to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even everyone within the estate was able to clearly sense that Chen Xi’s body was like a bottomless abyss that was madly absorbing the energy of the Prime Blood God Flags, and it was exceedingly astounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them didn’t dare believe how this energy that was mixed with sin, vengeful spirits, evil spirits, and blood could possibly be absorbed! Not to mention having seen such a scene in their lives, they hadn’t even imagined it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Yong, is that the profundity of Reparation from the Dhyana Forest Temple?” Baili Yan was surprised and asked while staring blankly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s probably not. The Reparation Dao Insight carries the sympathetic aura of ‘putting down one’s weapon to repent,’ and it’s completely different from the imposing aura he’s revealing at this moment. It seems like…that’s the aura of the Netherworld. But it’s extremely obscure, and I can’t be sure as well.” The old servant frowned and shook his head as he spoke.</span></p>

He urged the Prime Blood God Flags to transform into five terrifying rivers of blood that crushed down on Chen Xi.</span></p>

Even if countless lightning vortexes were revolving madly outside his body, they would be unable to devour it completely.</span></p>

Chen Xi held the Talisman Armament and seemed like a god that had leaped out of the cage of the world and wasn’t within the scope of the five elements. He swung the Talisman Armament, causing boundless fluctuations to erupt from it, and it forcefully blocked all the attacks against him.</span></p>

How could this kid by so heaven defying?! He’s actually not affected by the confinement!” Priest Zi Yun was shocked. Never had he imagined that someone could break free from the divine might of his Prime Blood God Flags, and it was simply unbelievable.</span></p>
