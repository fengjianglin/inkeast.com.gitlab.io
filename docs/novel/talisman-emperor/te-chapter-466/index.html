 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the next moment, Chen Xi had already caught up to it, and then thunderstorm vortexes gushed out from his palm to cover his fist that blasted out and smashed onto the back of the enormous Silver Wyrmpanther.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected of the descendant of an ancient ferocious beast, its bloodline is actually so pure and formidable.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi exclaimed endlessly with admiration in his heart as he felt the changes in the Shaman Energy within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his actions didn’t slow down in the slightest, and he instantly fanned the Flaming Peacock Fan when he saw the Silver Wyrmpanther emitting a shrill cry and fleeing, causing boundless flames to surge forward and envelope the area ahead before instantly charring the jet black fur of the Silver Wyrmpanther.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, it escaped calamity and transformed into its human form before stumbling to the ground. Everyone glanced over and were instantly dumbstruck. A few bloody holes had appeared on the human form body of the Silver Wyrmpanther, and those holes were blasted open by Chen Xi, causing it to almost lose its life. But even then, it had already completely lost its ability to battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trash! So many people holed up like turtles! Could it be that this is the strength possessed by first-rate Dynasties?” Chen Xi swept the surroundings with his gaze and spoke indifferently, yet he became even more vigilant in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until now, besides this Silver Wyrmpanther, the members of the three great groups hadn’t made a move, and they encircled him, yet didn’t attack. On the other hand, practically all the people that made a move earlier were genius experts of the Snowray Dynasty, Skywolf Dynasty, and the other Dynasties that had enmity with the Darchu Dynasty. Obviously, those three groups wanted to rely on numbers to completely exhaust him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Chen Xi had provoked them like this was for the sake of arouse the rage of everyone and cause the situation to be thrown into disorder, because the more disordered the situation was, the safer he would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, when they heard the word ‘trash’ within Chen Xi’s words, it instantly caused all the members of those three groups to reveal ferocious gazes, and their expressions were as unsightly as could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially because Chen Xi was only a single person, yet he dared provoke the genius experts of numerous Dynasties, how shameful was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re anxious to die, then we’ll fulfil your wishes. Everyone, make a move! Kill!” A group of genius experts from the three forces shouted out and didn’t hold back any longer as they struck out with their entire might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, they ceased their actions of encircling him without attacking, and they took the initiative to attack. If they were suppressed by a single person, then even if they won in the end, it would cause them to lose face and be ridiculed when news of the incident spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the burden of reputation. They were proud geniuses of the various Dynasties, and not only did they want to win, they wanted to win brilliantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Chen Xi took the initiative to strike out. He took a deep breath as the Starsky Wings unfolded, and he started charging forward into the group of people. The Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, Flaming Peacock Fan, Steller Lightningform, Grand Obliteration Fist, Deity Transformation, Eye of Divine Truth… Various martial techniques and Divine Abilities were skillfully and freely executed to blast out towards his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he similarly didn’t hold back in the slightest.</span></p>

The strength, flaws, and concealed attacks of his enemies were seen clearly by him, allowing him to avoid numerous fatal assaults.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was slightly difficult to turn the situation around. After all, all of his enemies were top experts in the younger generation. At this moment, when they joined forces to besiege him alone, the level of danger was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

For a time, battle cries shook the heavens as martial techniques and magic treasures flew about in the sky while the ground collapsed and caused rocks and dirt to shoot into the sky, and this battle enveloped the entire heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all the spectators in the distance held their breaths in deep concentration while they stared at the battle without blinking because they were deeply afraid of missing the slightest detail, and all of them waited silently for the final outcome,&nbsp;b</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ecause this battle had enormous implications.</span></p>

They were the proud geniuses of the various Dynasties, and they naturally wouldn’t go head on with Chen Xi at this moment.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because they felt their own status was more than a thousand times higher than Chen Xi, and they were far from having a need to risk their lives against Chen Xi and be injured in the fight along with him.</span></p>

All of this caused them to treasure their lives to the extreme, so how could they possible risk their lives and go against Chen Xi, who was about to die?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this that they’d endured and waited with the intention of giving Chen Xi the final fatal strike when he was unable to persist and annihilate him in one go!</span></p>

They knew how to analyze advantage and disadvantage, and they knew how to decide according to the situation. In other words, Chen Xi was far from being strong to the point of forcing them to make a move, and the reason they were enduring and waiting was only because they were worried that Chen Xi would take them down with him at the moment before his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, he who’s unafraid of being cut to piece dares to unhorse the Emperor.</span></p>

Numerous heaven-rank magic treasures fluttered about in the air and tore through the sky while numerous martial techniques and Divine Abilities poured down and crushed everything in the surroundings. Divine lights glowed brilliantly and illuminated everything for 5,000km as the cries of battle shot into the sky and shook the nine heavens.</span></p>

Now, a horrifying battle had occurred here once more, and the only difference was that it was a battle of one person against many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But its impetus was similarly shocking, and similarly shook the heavens and the earth, causing the ground in the nearby 5,000km to transform into a charred and cracked expanse. Mountains and rock turned to ash, explosions rumbled, and waves of air swept out. The scene was shocking and horrifying.</span></p>

His entire body was covered in injuries and mottled traces of blood. Even though his body refinement cultivation was formidable, he was unable to recover in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, Chen Xi was sufficiently formidable, and coupled with the combination of the Eye of Divine Truth and the Starsky Wings, it was extremely difficult for these people to kill him. But the exhaustion of his strength was slightly high, causing him to almost be unable to bear it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these weren’t important, what caused Chen Xi to be worried was that along with the unfolding of the battle, the golden core within his body had actually trembled slightly, and his soul shook with fear as well, as it seemed to have noticed that some sort of calamity was about to descend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Tribulation!</span></p>

It just had to come now. If the Rebirth Tribulation arrives at this moment, then these fellows probably don’t even have to continue attacking and I would lose my life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Tribulation was a dual tribulation of the Heaven Dao and the body and mind, and it was unfathomable. Once it descended, then not only did one have to resist the tribulation flames that emerged in one’s body and mind, one had to face the strikes of tribulation lightning that the Heaven Dao sent down. The slightest carelessness could cause one to perish and be transformed into nothingness by the tribulation.</span></p>

And one’s cultivation would rise to an entirely new height, whereas if one was unable to overcome it, then there was only a single path: eternal death.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the next moment, when Chen Xi swept the surroundings with his gaze and saw the savage and bloodthirsty expressions everyone possessed, when he saw the coldness and disdain that suffused the faces of Pei Yu and the other two, a feeling of annoyance gushed out abruptly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them think I’ll die for sure?</span></p>

Chen Xi clearly knew that the sudden arrival of the tribulation had affected his mentality, yet he wasn’t willing to restrain it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t willing to perish like this, he wanted to resist until the end!</span></p>

Everything in this world achieves rebirth in different ways. Since I, Chen Xi, have drawn the Rebirth Tribulation while carrying out a slaughter, then I’ll achieve rebirth while slaughtering!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he shouted over and over again in his heart, Chen Xi’s mind became more and more calm as his gaze once again became firm like a rock and without the slightest ripple any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were 3,000 Grand Daos, so there were naturally a myriad of methods to overcoming the tribulation. Since the heavens made him experience the tribulation while in battle, then he would bravely resist it until the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wasn’t this a type of rebirth as well?</span></p>

I treated you with respect all along the way, yet you didn’t appreciate it and went against me in every aspect. You’re arrogant and unruly, and you’ve caused me to lose the chance to enter a secret realm. Today, you must atone for your sins with death!” In the distance, Pei Yu seemed to have noticed a slight problem had occurred in Chen Xi’s state, causing his spirits to be refreshed, and then he shouted out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, his right arm shook, causing a wisp of a dazzling light to fly out from his hand and charge into the sky.</span></p>

Along with Pei Yu making a move, they felt the laws in this area of the heavens and the earth seemed to have undergone a change, and it was as if a god was about to emerge in the world.</span></p>
