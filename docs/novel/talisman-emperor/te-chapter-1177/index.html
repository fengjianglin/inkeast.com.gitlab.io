 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they left Assignment Mountain, Xuanyuan Yun, Mu Yuchong, Liang Ren, and Gu Yueming left successively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only two years left before the inner court exam, and Xuanyuan Yun and Mu Yuchong were determined to participate in it. So the important matter at hand was for them to make the best use of their time and charge into the Golden Immortal Realm before striving to charge into the top fifty of the Allheaven Golden Rankings as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Liang Ren and Gu Yueming deeply sensed extreme pressure because of the problem of earning Starpoints, so they didn’t have the heart to continue strolling about the academy. They directly returned to their respective abodes to study the various assignments that rewarded Starpoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only A’xiu didn’t leave so quickly because she still had things to tell Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi, your enemy is the Zuoqiu Clan, and it’s absolutely impossible for you to head over to the Zuoqiu Clan and take revenge by yourself. You must seize this opportunity and pay attention to improving your reputation. If someone invited you to join a group, then you absolutely must not agree because in that way, you’d only be able to become the vassal of another and not possess a force of your own.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned and said, “Are there many powers in the academy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu nodded. “Numerous. These powers were all established amongst students. Every single student who was able to enter Dao Emperor Academy is a top genius in the Immortal Dimension. Perhaps they aren’t so striking in the academy, but in the outside world, they could be considered as geniuses that were rare to see in a thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On the other hand, Dao Emperor Academy could be called a place where the geniuses of the Immortal Dimension gathered. The eight thousand students of the outer court and three thousand students of the inner court seem to be small in number, but don’t forget that all of them are top disciples in the younger generation. Moreover, most of them have the support of clans and powers behind them, so they possessed extremely great potential and background.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a potential force that no power in the three dimensions dares to overlook, and it’s even to the extent that it can decide the situation and movement of the Immortal Dimension in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s expression gradually became serious a she listened to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to what A’xiu had said, when the disciples of top powers like the seven great ancient clans, Dragon Dimension, and Buddha Dimension entered the academy, they would shoulder an imperceptible responsibility to try their best and rope in the other students of the academy for their own use!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only in this way would they had a large group of help by their sides when they left the academy and started to reveal their brilliance in the Immortal Dimension!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This group of help wasn’t simply a group of subordinates because various powers similarly stood behind them, and it was even to the extent that there was no lack of inheritors of a power amongst them. If all of them and the powers behind them could be consolidated together, then it would obviously be an enormous force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she spoke up to here, A’xiu intentionally gave him an example. “For example, my Xuanyuan Clan established a Xuanyuan Society within the academy a very long time ago. The last president was my older brother, Xuanyuan Qingfeng, and the current president is my cousin brother Xuanyuan Xiao. Presently, my cousin brother has already drawn in over a hundred students in the academy to his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amongst these hundred students are disciples from the great powers of the various continents in the Immortal Dimension, the heirs of ancient clans, and warriors that possessed astounding natural talent and strength. When the day comes that my cousin brother leaves the academy, these hundred plus students and the powers behind them will become a great assistance to my cousin brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In this way, this force can be considered to be a force that belongs to my Xuanyuan Clan. After all, my cousin brother is their leader, but most importantly, he’s a disciple of my Xuanyuan Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she spoke up to here, A’xiu smiled as she looked at Chen Xi and said, “Now, you ought to understand, right? When you become the vassal of another, it’s equivalent to joining sides with a power. It can’t be said to be a loss of freedom, but not everyone will help you when you intend to take revenge from the Zuoqiu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished listening to all of this, Chen Xi did indeed have a feeling of sudden enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The existence of student powers like the Xuanyuan Society could absolutely be considered to be planned carefully and farsighted. On the surface, it was only roping in a group of dazzling geniuses in the academy, but in truth, it was indirectly drawing over the powers that stood behind these students!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The great figures in the academy…” Chen Xi suddenly realized something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could finish speaking, A’xiu chuckled as she interrupted him. “They wouldn’t bother about it. This is the academy, and many of the instructors here come varying great powers. So how could they interfere? It’s even to the extent that they eagerly look forward to their clan being able to draw over some outstanding students.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi pondered for a long time before he laughed bitterly in the end and said, “But I have nothing now, so what will I draw people over with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This matter sounded simple, yet it was extremely troublesome. The main reason a power like the Xuanyuan Society was able to draw over many students was that one of the seven great ancient clans, the Xuanyuan Clan, was standing behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu’s eyes glistened as she stared at Chen Xi and said, “You’re the first amongst the new students. Merely this title will receive the respect of many students. Most importantly, you have boundless potential to the point that even all the old seniors of the academy treated you differently. Would anyone dare say you have nothing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She paused for a moment and continued. “In short, you shouldn’t worry so much about it. So long as you decide to establish a power of your own, then I’ll help you with it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like a normal thing to say, but when it entered into Chen Xi’s ears, it caused him to be extremely moved instead. He stared blankly at A’xiu’s clear and pure face, and he was actually at a loss for what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu wasn’t embarrassed at all from being stared at by Chen Xi, and she blinked her eyes and chuckled instead. “Aren’t you really touched?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded. “Of course.” He answered without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu smiled to the point her eyes curved into two crescents, and she said, “Since it’s like this, then promise me one thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi said, “Forget one thing, I’d even agree to ten or a hundred.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu restrained her smile and placed her hands behind her back while she raised her clear little face to stare at Chen Xi, and then she said word by word, “It’s very simple, and it’s…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She suddenly fell into silence when she spoke up to here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi waited for a long time, and then he couldn’t help but ask. “What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu suddenly smiled slyly and blinked her eyes. “I’ll tell you in the future. I’m leaving first, otherwise, Master will definitely scold me if he notices that I snuck out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as she finished speaking, A’xiu chuckled as she turned around and left swiftly while her clear and resounding laughter that sounded like a wind chime still drifted endlessly through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned. In the end, he shrugged helplessly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu is still so mischievous…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vastcloud Mountain, within the Emperor Grade Abode on Lucky Rain Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Xi returned, he saw the tiny cauldron was still absorbing Primeval Chaotic Qi, so he didn’t disturb the tiny cauldron and directly sat down cross-legged before falling into deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, even though I’m not worried about suffering a lethal blow from the Zuoqiu Clan while in the academy, I have to take precautions against Zuoqiu Yin and the others carrying out operations against me in secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s also the Dragon Dimension’s Ao Wuming, the Jiang Clan’s Jiang Canghai, and the other students related to the Zuoqiu Clan. I have to take some precautions against all of them as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all of these are small matters. The most important matter is still my cultivation. I have to strive to advance into the Golden Immortal Realm and be ranked within the top fifty of the Allheaven Golden Rankings within two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides this, I have to make the best use of my time to earn Starpoints so as to avoid allowing the River Diagram fragment and Chaos Quintessence Fragment being take away by another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for establishing my own power, I can put it off for now. I’ll definitely come into contact with other students during my cultivation in the future, and I’ll act according to the situation when the time comes…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi silently pondered about a lot of things before he finally ordered all his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without wasting any more time, Chen Xi directly entered the world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His clone had always been meditating here and tempering itself. Its strength had already advanced to the advanced-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm, and it was only a trace away from attaining the perfection-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason it advanced so swiftly was firstly because the Temporal Laws in the world of stars was different, but most importantly, it was because of the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form it cultivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This supreme body refinement technique inherited from a primeval Fiendgod was extremely difficult to cultivate. Up until now, Chen Xi’s clone hadn’t even broken through to the first stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the strange thing was that during the process of cultivating the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form, his body refinement cultivation experienced an extremely obvious improvement, and it could be considered to be a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist, I can only stop your cultivation for now…” Chen Xi’s main body walked forward and spoke apologetically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His clone opened its eyes and stood up before cupping its fists. “It’s my duty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, both of them smiled at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, it was only Chen Xi alone here, and he was only playing two roles by himself. It was no different from talking to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he made a small joke with himself, Chen Xi handed the Violet Ribbon Starcrest to his clone while he sat down cross-legged within the world of stars instead, and he started to cultivate in meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Emperor Grade Abode was filled with thick Primeval Chaotic Qi, yet it wasn’t of great use to Chen Xi for now. It was precisely as Instructor Wang Hen had said, the Primeval Chaotic Qi would only display its true magical effect when he charged into the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, Chen Xi was only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, so he naturally had no use for the Primeval Chaotic Qi. Coupled with his body possessed the assistance of the Dark Parasol Sapling, he didn’t have to worry about lacking replenishment of Immortal Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fundamental reason Chen Xi had chosen to enter into closed door cultivation within the world of stars was because of the different Temporal Laws in the world of stars, and it allowed him to charge into an even higher realm of cultivation as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, his clone that wore an apricot yellow Daoist robe walked out from the world of stars. He stretched himself nicely before sitting down cross-legged and started glancing through the assignments within the Violet Ribbon Starcrest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Chen Xi’s plan. His main body would work hard on cultivating in order to improve his cultivation while the earning of Starpoints would be left to his clone. In this way, he would be able to save a great deal of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Planting type assignments. No, it wastes too much of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Assignments that require leaving the academy. This won’t do as well because it’s inadvisable for me to leave the academy for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taming related assignments…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pill refinement assignments…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s immortal sense had entered the Violet Ribbon Starcrest, and then numerous screens of light instantly floated into appearance within his mind. On the screens of light were various different assignments that were classified by type.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, most of these assignments weren’t suitable to be completed in a short period of time. Moreover, the Starpoint rewards they offered were too few, and this sight caused Chen Xi’s brows to knit together tightly.</span></p>
