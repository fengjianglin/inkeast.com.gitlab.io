 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially since she felt that the sect had gone too far in this matter this time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thoughts bloomed in An Ke’s mind, yet she swiftly explained. “Chen Xi, these disciples that are guarding the entrance have only just entered the sect not too long ago, so they aren’t aware of the internal matters of the sect. Actually, it’s a misunderstanding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained gloomy as he said, “A misunderstanding? I’ve even handed over my command token. Could it be that it’s insufficient to prove my identity? Moreover, they’ve clearly recognized me, yet still took me to be an enemy. Can this be called a misunderstanding?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Ke was questioned to the point her face froze, and she was slightly as a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t bear putting her in a difficult situation when he saw this because all those years ago when he’d just entered the sect, An Ke had helped him on numerous occasions, so even if he had a bellyful of rage, he would absolutely not vent it on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he paused for a moment, and then he sighed. “An Ke, tell me frankly. Exactly what is going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Ke bit her lips, yet she didn’t know from where to begin, causing her expression to be indeterminate, and she said after quite a long pause, “Chen Xi, why don’t you come with me to see the Sect Master, and you’ll understand everything once you ask him. I…really don’t know how to explain it to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw her struggling and being indeterminate like this, Chen Xi’s heart sank, and he had a deeper feeling that it wasn’t anything good, so he shook his head and said, “I’ll naturally go pay a visit to the Sect Master later. But I’m returning to the West Radiance Peak first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, An Ke seemed to have thought of something, and words escaped her mouth. “No!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, when she saw Chen Xi’s expression hat had suddenly turned cold, she cried out in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shit!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She swiftly said, “Chen Xi, take it as me begging you, go pay a visit to the Sect Master first. I swear that the West Radiance Peak is completely unharmed, and it didn’t suffer any damage during the period that you weren’t present in the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the more she acted in this way, the more unsightly Chen Xi’s expression was, and he was even able to guess that even if the West Radiance Peak didn’t suffer any damage, it had probably undergone some sort of huge unexpected event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An Ke, for the sake of our relationship, please move aside!” Chen Xi had a murderous expression while his voice revealed an indisputable tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he’d already leaped out with a large stride, and he avoided An Ke before charging towards the West Radiance Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, there’s no one left on the West Radiance Peak!” An Ke couldn’t help but shout out from behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stopped abruptly while his expressions instantly became icy cold to the extreme. People that knew him well knew that his expression would seem extremely calm and indifferent when he was furious to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even an outside like Liang Bing had discerned something was unusual, and she couldn’t help but frown. “Young Miss, if you have something to say, then speak frankly. Hesitating to speak will only cause you to be misunderstood. Could it be that you think there are some things that Chen Xi can’t deal with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice carried a trace of immortal profundity because every single move an expert at the Mysterious Immortal Realm made carried the profundity of causing ‘technique to appear alone with their words.’ So when these words entered into An Ke’s ears, they were like a resounding bell that carried an enlightening feeling, and it instantly caused her to recover from her panic and become much calmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi had already vanished when she wanted to speak again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing shook her head when she saw this, and then her figure flashed and transformed into a flowing ray of light as she vanished while carrying An Ke along with her. Only those disciples that guarded the entrance were left kneeling on the ground, and they glanced at each other with gazes that carried shock and extreme fear.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">West Radiance Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like An Ke had said, every single blade of grass, piece of wood, mountain, or rock in the area of the West Radiance Peak was just as before, and it didn’t suffer any damage. Moreover, there were numerous precious beasts patrolling and lurking within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, besides this, the entire West Radiance Peak was silent. Not only were Huo Mo Lei and the others not there, even Ling Bai, Mu Kui, Bai Kui, A’xiu, Xueyan, and the clansmen of the Ninth Hell Tribe weren’t on the West Radiance Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this way, it seemed to be even stranger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the current West Radiance Peak couldn’t be compared to before now. It was a place that everyone in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect clearly knew couldn’t be offended, and it was even to the extent that the West Radiance Peak was rather renowned in the entire Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, in his own territory, his friends and seniors had all vanished! How could Chen Xi accept this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant he laid eyes on this scene, he felt the flames of rage in his heart being on the verge of erupting like a volcano, and every single inch of pores in his body started to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where are all of them!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi recalled the attitude of taking him as an enemy that those disciples had when he just entered the sect, and he recalled An Ke’s hesitant expression. So, how could his heart possibly calm down?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, even though they aren’t in the sect now, there is no danger to their lives.” Meanwhile, An Ke had rushed over while being carried by Liang Bing, and she spoke with both anxiety and worry when she saw Chen Xi’s eyes to clearly revealed monstrous flames of rage. “You…you must control your rage! You must not be impulsive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi turned around. Gis voice seemed as if it whistled out from the depths of an icy pit, and it was icy cold like a blade as he asked. “Tell me, who exactly did this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Ke was stunned, and she didn’t know how to tell him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, come with me. The sect will give you an explanation.” Meanwhile, a tall and mighty figure suddenly flashed over from the distance, and it carried a dignified and firm bearing. It was exactly Elder Lie Peng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi raised his eyes and stared at Lie Peng for a long time before he nodded and said, “Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lie Peng controlled the matters of punishment in the sect and had always treated him well. It could be said that besides Madman Liu, it was Lie Peng, the Sect Master, and the old man that lived in seclusion and stood on guard before the Book Reserve that treated him the best in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So Chen Xi was unable to refuse his request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is?” Lie Peng’s expression instantly eased up greatly when he saw Chen Xi reply, and he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart before he glanced to the side. His eyes couldn’t help but focus when he saw Liang Bing.</span></p>

Even though, it was only a single word…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused his heart that was in his throat to finally calm down slightly. He was indeed worried that because of some sort of unexpected event, the Sect Master and Lie Peng had set up a trap and would suddenly make a move against him. This was something that he was absolutely unable to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because in his heart, they were both seniors that were extremely respected by him, and they were extremely nice to him. If such a match really occurred, then he would surely be unable to endure the blow it struck on him.</span></p>

You know as well, Xueyan is a pure blooded Nine-Tailed Fox that’s innately charming and rare. Thus, her race is very popular amongst the great figures of the Immortal Dimension.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to what he said, it was precisely for the sake of protecting Xueyan from being forcefully seized that he as the Sect Master of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect still had no choice but to temporarily place everyone from the West Radiance Peak outside the sect so as to avoid the displeasure of those people from the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, doing this was for the sake of calming the flames of rage of those people from the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Wen Huating had never expected that that person would somehow find out that Xueyan belonged to Chen Xi, so he hated Chen Xi as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to Chen Xi being away from the sect, that figure from the Immortal Dimension could only forcefully order the entire Nine Radiance Sword Sect to take Chen Xi as an enemy, and he was waiting for Chen Xi to return before making Chen Xi suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It sounded very laughable and even absurd. But Chen Xi knew that this was the style of the descendants of great figures from the Immortal Dimension. They were arrogant, overbearing, and considered everyone in the world to be beneath them. Once they descended to the Mortal Dimension, they were even fearless and lawless. So transferring his rage onto Chen Xi because he was unable to obtain Xue Yang seemed to be very normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Chen Xi finally understood everything, and when he thought of how all of this was caused by a descendant of a great figure from the Immortal Dimension, he truly wished for nothing more than to kill that bastard right now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was before, he would surely be extremely fearful when he heard the words Immortal Dimension, and he might even have no choice but to endure this. But it was different now. Not only had he seen these so-called young masters and young misses from the Immortal Dimension in the Talisman Dimension, he’d even killed many of them, so how could he possibly care now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, Chen Xi, you don’t know that for the sake of protecting everyone on your West Radiance Peak, the Sect Master has endured countless humiliation. So you should show understanding for the difficulty of the sect because this is already the best outcome that the Sect Master was capable of striving for you.” Lie Peng frowned as he sighed. His ferocious face carried a strand of rage and grievance as well, and he seemed to have no place to vent and could only forcefully endure it in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and worked hard to restrain the seething killing intent in his heart as he asked. “Sect Master, Martial Uncle Lie Peng, why are the people that have come from the Immortal Dimension running wild like this? Could it be that the seniors in the sect don’t care?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was speaking about those seniors that lived in seclusion within Divine Radiance Peak because there was no lack of terrifying existences there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason is very simple, these people are from the forces of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in the Immortal Dimension, and this power was formed by the great figures from our Nine Radiance Sword Sect that ascended into the Immortal Dimension during the countless years of the past. Even though only a mere few great figures descended to the Mortal Dimension this time, but not to mention me and the Sect Master, even those seniors with extremely high seniority in the sect had to be respectful.” Lie Peng let out a long sigh while his voice carried a trace of deep helplessness. Obviously, he was rather displeased by the actions of these people from the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s brows knit together even more tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s really troublesome if it’s like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
