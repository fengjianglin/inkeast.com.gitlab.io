 <p>Chapter 152 – Visitors at the Peak</p>
 <p>After spending the time for an entire incense stick to burn, Chen Xi finally finished sorting through all the storage Magic Treasures. As he looked at the various treasures that were twined with the glow of treasures, he couldn’t help but gasp.</p>
 <p>Two million kgs of spirit liquid!</p>
 <p>230 yellow-rank Magic Treasures of low-grade, 77 of intermediate-grade, 21 of high-grade, and nine top-grade!</p>
 <p>Amongst the treasures were various cultivation jade slips that numbered 62, 89 bottles of various medicinal pills, and some other spirit materials, ores, and rare treasures… They were numerous in number and densely packed.</p>
 <p><i>Wealth fell down from the sky! Sure enough, a man is poor without a windfall, just like horses are thin without eating grass all night. Those two million kgs of spirit liquid are sufficient for me to cultivate until the Golden Hall Realm!</i> Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh with emotion to himself, and then he shot his gaze towards these yellow-rank Magic Treasures he’d plundered. With a quick glance over, he couldn’t help but frown, because of these yellow-rank Magic Treasures, most of them were bells, hammers, sabers, axes, and other uncommon Magic Treasures. There were only six high-grade flying swords and a single top-grade flying sword amongst them!</p>
 <p><i>Looks like I’ve rejoiced too soon this time! </i>Chen Xi sighed.</p>
 <p>His eight Netherezim Flying Swords and 56 high-grade yellow-rank flying swords had all been obliterated during the battle with the Bloodinfant Immortal Slaughtering Formation the captain of the Devilspirit Guards controlled. In terms of value, they were even more valuable than all these yellow-rank Magic Treasures he’d plundered!</p>
 <p>Especially those eight Netherezim Flying Swords that were a set of top-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasures he’d obtained in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain; they were extremely precious. Now that they’d been obliterated into nothingness, it naturally caused his heart to ache extremely. He was originally hoping to obtain a few pleasant surprises from these Magic Treasures he’d plundered, yet how could he have imagined that there were only six high-grade yellow-rank flying swords and a single top-grade yellow rank flying sword amongst these Magic Treasures?</p>
 <p>Presently, besides the Grand Astral Palm, Chen Xi’s strongest trump card was the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation, yet if he wanted to exert the full might of the sword formation, he instead needed 64 flying swords. Moreover, the quality of these flying swords couldn’t be lower than the high-grade. In this way, he had no choice but to consider purchasing some flying swords once again to replenish them.</p>
 <p>Of course, he’d bought two sets of top-grade yellow-rank flying swords in Misty Sea City, and the first set of 56 flying swords were already gone now, whereas, the other set of 64 flying sword was something he bought for Chen Hao, so it was impossible for him to use them.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the total value of the Magic Treasures on the ground was extremely considerable, and when exchanged into spirit liquids, it would be more than enough even if he were to buy 64 top-grade yellow-rank flying swords.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>With a flick of his sleeve, Chen Xi put away all the treasures on the ground into the Buddha’s Pagoda, and then he didn’t hesitate any longer to start circulating his cultivation and cultivating.</p>
 <p>The Hidden Dragon Rankings this time allowed him to obtain great gains, and it also allowed him to fully recognize his own strength. Perhaps he was able to easily annihilate ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators, defeat Golden Hall Realm cultivators, and perhaps he was able to flee from the hands of Golden Core Realm cultivators. But once he went up against a Rebirth Realm cultivator, then he would completely have no ability to hold his own.</p>
 <p>When he recalled the scene of himself being jointly attacked by Su Zhentian and the other three Rebirth Realm cultivators earlier, that feeling of despair, helplessness, and uneasiness was something that Chen Xi truly didn’t want to experience a second time.</p>
 <p>Moreover, his current residence within the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect was completely reliant on Bei Heng’s power and influence. Once he lost this layer of protection, his situation in Dragon Lake City would instantly become precarious.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t only because of his four great enemies, the Su Clan, Cang Clan, Starnet Palace, and Myriadcloud Institution. Most importantly, it was because in his possession was an Immortal Artifact that countless people coveted!</p>
 <p>A man’s wealth was his own ruin by causing greed in others. Chen Xi’s recognition of these words could be said to be exceedingly deep. He even suspected that if Bei Heng had the intention of obtaining this Immortal Artifact, then he would be utterly unable to resist. It was either hand it over or die!</p>
 <p>So, no matter if it was to protect his life or to protect this Immortal Artifact in his possession, working hard to improve his own strength was the most pressing matter at the moment!</p>
 <p>Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, and with a command in his heart, the spirit liquid within the jade bottle directly flew into his mouth. Under the lead of the Ice Crane Technique, the spirit liquids swiftly circulated all around his body.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>Within the space in Chen Xi’s violet palace, the enormous lake of True Essence violently roiled, and the icy True Essence that was like ice crystals started to rise and expand explosively with an extremely swift speed. This caused the lake in his violet palace to instantly become more and more large, more and more deep, and the six glittering and translucent stars that hung above the large lake became even more dazzling and resplendent as they echoed with each other at a distance and effused out boundless amounts of chilly brilliance.</p>
 <p>Expanding!</p>
 <p>Madly expanding!</p>
 <p>Presently, Chen Xi had three million kgs of spirit liquid in his possession, and he could be said to have an extremely deep amount of resources. He entirely didn’t have to worry about the poverty-stricken scene of possessing nothing.</p>
 <p>Just like this, 5,000 kgs of spirit liquids, 25,000 kgs of spirit liquids… All of the spirit liquids transformed into thick and vast True Essence that poured into the great lake in Chen Xi’s violet palace, and they ceaselessly refined, flushed, and expanded the large lake, causing Chen Xi’s strength to rise steadily bit by bit at a visible speed.</p>
 <p>Long ago, when he was in the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Ranger, Chen Xi had once sighed with emotion. If it wasn’t for the insufficient spirit liquids, he would have even been able to break through to the Golden Hall Realm in one go. The reason was extremely simple: the strength of his soul, Dao Heart, and his comprehension of the Heaven’s Dao had already surpassed the scope of his cultivation. Amongst them, his soul’s strength was already comparable to a Golden Core Realm cultivator! Perhaps it was extremely difficult for other cultivators to breakthrough to the next realm, but to Chen Xi, so long as he could accumulate sufficient True Essence, his cultivation would rise vigorously all the way.</p>
 <p>After all was said and done, breaking through to the next realm required strengthening of the soul, comprehension of the Dao, and tempering of the Dao Heart. When these three aspects were accumulated to a sufficient extent, it was exceedingly easy for one to advance after absorbing spirit liquids to cultivate.</p>
 <p>25,000 kgs of spirit liquid!</p>
 <p>50,000 kgs of spirit liquid!</p>
 <p>100,000 kgs of spirit liquid!</p>
 <p>Crash!</p>
 <p>Enormous rolling waves abruptly arose within the great lake in his violet palace, whereas, in the sky above the lake, another dazzling True Essence star had shockingly appeared, the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm!</p>
 <p>If this scene were to be seen by other cultivators, their jaws would surely be shocked wide open. Because 100,000 kgs of spirit liquids was already sufficient for ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators to advance three levels, yet Chen Xi had merely advanced a single level…</p>
 <p>This was the miraculous effect of cultivating the Ice Crane Technique. This rare and valuable qi refinement cultivation technique caused the violet palace lake that Chen Xi cultivated to be much wider and deeper than ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators, and the True Essence accumulated within it was pure and vast to the extreme. So, the spirit liquids consumed by it was naturally countless times more than ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators. It was precisely because of this that Chen Xi’s Dao Foundation had already been tempered to become extraordinarily dense now, and his future path of cultivation would become an extremely level path.</p>
 <p>After all, the development of the violet palace was the establishment of the Dao Foundation. The more solid the Dao Formation was, the greater the accomplishments achieved in the future and the energy controlled by one would rise along with it to become tremendous.</p>
 <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>
 <p>After he advanced to the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm, Chen Xi still didn’t stop in the slightest, and he continued to cultivate. He forgot the time, forgot everything around him, and his entire mind was immersed in the profound state of growth. His heart was completely vacant, forgetting both himself and everything else.</p>
 <p>After an unknown amount of time, Chen Xi suddenly awoke from his cultivating, and at the instant he opened his eyes, there was a wisp of an extremely brilliant light that silently flashed by.</p>
 <p>Hu!</p>
 <p>Chen Xi lightly breathed out, and a stream of airflow shot out like an arrow before piercing a hole through the wall that was 30m away with a bang!</p>
 <p>Breathing out air like an arrow, the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm!</p>
 <p>Chen Xi stood up, his entire bearing more wispy and extraordinary than before, and it was as if he would transform into a feather and soar into the heavens with a gust of wind. His entire body seemed translucent, and he possessed the air of an immortal.</p>
 <p><i>Advancing to the 7</i><i>th</i><i> star of the Violet Palace Realm consumed 100,000 kgs of spirit liquids, the 8</i><i>th</i><i> level of the Violet Palace Realm consumed almost 200,000 kgs of spirit liquids, and the 9</i><i>th</i><i> star of the Violet Palace Realm consumed an entire 500,000 kgs of spirit liquids… If I were to activate the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation again with my current strength, it wouldn’t be a problem to activate it ten times. Even if I don’t utilize the Grand Astral Palm, I would still be able to easily break open the Triwater Go Prison formation that Su Jiao set up! </i>As Chen Xi felt the boundless energy that gushed out from his violet palace, he nodded in satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“Supreme Ancestor, Grand Ancestor Wen Xuan and the Patriarchs of the Duanmu, Du, and Son clans have come to pay a visit.” It was at this moment that a pleasing female's voice that carried a respectful tone sounded out from outside.Chen Xi was stunned, then he pushed open the door and exited the room. He saw Wang Wan, who wore a light yellow dress, standing there beautifully with an experienced and elegant manner, and her disposition was extraordinary.</p>
 <p>“Oh, how long have I been in closed door cultivation?” asked Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“Supreme Ancestor, an entire month has already passed.” Wang Wan spoke with a lowered head. As she spoke, her heart abruptly started to thump because she acutely noticed that compared to one month ago, the cultivation of this brother of the Supreme Ancestor seemed to have skyrocketed by a large amount, and the aura emitted from his body actually caused her to have the vast feeling of facing a boundless large sea.</p>
 <p><i>One month? </i>Chen Xi was stunned. He never imagined that he’d just started cultivating and a month had actually passed. As the saying goes, there’s no sense of time in the mountains, causing one to not know when it is after the winter finally passed.</p>
 <p>“Okay, how long have they been waiting?” Chen Xi restrained his thoughts and he walked towards the main hall as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“They already came once when you were in closed door cultivation, and this time is already the third time they’ve come to visit.” Wang Wan hurriedly jogged over and swiftly replied.</p>
 <p>As she spoke, the two of them had arrived at the main hall.</p>
 <p>At this moment, within the main hall of True Heart Peak was not only Daoist Wen Xuan, but the Du Clan’s Patriarch Du Wuyuan, the Song Clan’s Patriarch Song Wenchong, and the Duanmu Clan’s Patriarch Duanmu Yunkong seated within. There was also Chen Hao, Du Qingxi, Song Lin, and Duanmu Ze.</p>
 <p>There were naturally female Inner Court disciples at the side that were serving tea and water or serving fine wine and divine fruits. The entire main hall didn’t seem to be cold and quiet, and it instead revealed a strand of a lively air.</p>
