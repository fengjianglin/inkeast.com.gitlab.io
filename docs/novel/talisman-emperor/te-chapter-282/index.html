 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s sudden appearance caused everyone to be stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior!” A trace of pleasant surprise arose in Qin Yuwei’s eyes that were about to shed tears, and she seemed as if she’d found a pillar she could lean on, causing her to completely lose her sorrowful and despaired appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Tong greets Senior.” The tall and robust Luo Tong puckered his lips as he spoke slowly, and he felt pleasantly surprised in his heart, but more than that, he felt heartfelt gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Qin Clan had already declined now and had long since lost its former glory and period of prosper. Just like the attendant had said, a phoenix without feathers was inferior to a chicken. No one would care about who he, Luo Tong, was, and no one would pity Qin Yu Wei who was the Eldest Young Miss of the Qin Clan. Conversely, there were many that seized this opportunity to add insult to injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the attendant before them that ridiculed them indifferently, Sikong Hua that seized the opportunity to extort and coerce them, and the surrounding people that looked on and did nothing, all of this had vividly portrayed Luo Tong and Qin Yuwei’s current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi was a young man they’d met by chance and had already saved their lives previously, yet he stood out once more at this moment. So how could it not cause Luo Tong to feel grateful?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sikong Hua’s expression became extremely gloomy instead as he sized up Chen Xi from top to bottom, and then he laughed coldly. “Brother, you look extremely unfamiliar, you’re probably not someone from Maple Leaf City, right? I advise you not to interfere in this matter, as it wouldn’t be good if you bring calamity onto yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah customer, you look so young so you probably don’t know the reputation of the Sikong Clan, right? Besides the Earthly Heaven Sect, the Sikong Clan is the most powerful in our Maple Leaf City, and Young Master Sikong Hua is the second young master of the Sikong Clan and possesses a status that you can only look up to. It’s best if you don’t bring trouble to yourself.” The nearby attendant spoke out as well. He noticed that Chen Xi’s attire didn’t seem like that of an ordinary person, so his tone had become much milder, yet all his words still took Sikong Hua’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged as he nodded to Qin Yuwei and Luo Tong, and then looked indifferently at the attendant and said, “How is that piece of 10,000 year old soul nurturing spirit wood?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attendant was stunned but still answered. “It’s not the slightest bit less. It’s rare that it’s preserved extremely well, and its quality is one of the best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head and sighed. “Then what’re you standing here for? Could it be that you didn’t hear what I said earlier? Do the attendants of your Treasure Heaven Pavilion treat customers like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attendant’s expression instantly became indeterminate. As an attendant of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion, his status was naturally different when compared to servants. It couldn’t be said that he possessed high status, but he was at least capable of relying on the reputation of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion to masquerade about. Never had he imagined that Chen Xi wouldn’t give him the slightest face and even used the identity of being a customer to pressure him, and he was instantly angered to the point of almost exploding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was unable to dispute Chen Xi’s words, as after all was said and done, he was only an attendant of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion, and he was no different than a lowly servant in the eyes of some great figures and was even inferior to an ant. So he could only bully some ordinary people that possessed neither background nor strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Taking my goodwill as ill intent? You’re truly courting death…” In the end, the attendant glared resentfully at Chen Xi before turning around to exchange for the Ambergis, yet he still muttered unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, do you want me to kill this bastard? A lowly attendant that actually dares to insult you like this truly deserves death!” Mu Kui’s shiny jade eyes stared fixedly at the attendant, and his gaze became ruthless and icy cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need.” Chen Xi shook his head, it was too senseless to fuss about it with an attendant that looked down upon others. Coupled with the fact that he was at the Treasure Heaven Pavilion and had obtained a great deal of benefit from Ya Qing earlier, out of consideration for Ya Qing, he couldn’t be bothered to make a fuss about it with the attendant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kid, you really want to interfere in the business of my Sikong Clan?” Sikong Hua’s expression became extremely ominous as killing intent gushed within his heart. From the beginning until the end, Chen Xi hadn’t taken a glance at him and had simply disregarded his existence. As the second young master of the Sikong Clan, when had he suffered such treatment? It was simply going too far!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Want to fight? A tiny Golden Hall Realm cultivator like you dares to flaunt your strength before your Grandpa Mu Kui?” Mu Kui couldn’t contain his anger since long ago, and he glared at Sikong Hua with murderous gaze and didn’t conceal his killing intent and rage in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You dare insult me?” Sikong Hua cried out with a sharp voice. But the formidable aura emitted by Mu Kui caused him to be extremely fearful, so even though he was furious in his heart, he didn’t dare make a move here, and he took a deep breath right away before laughing coldly and ominously. “Good, good, good! I’ll remember both of you. So long as the both of you can leave Maple Leaf City, then I, Sikong Hua, will change my surname to yours!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow was rather intelligent and knew that it wasn’t suitable to make a move in the Treasure Heaven pavilion, so he turned around and left as soon as he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to follow my surname? Ptooey! Is there even such a shameless person in this world? What the hell!?” Mu Kui spoke with an expression of disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sikong Hua had just walked out of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion when Mu Kui’s words entered clearly into his ears, causing him to be angered to the point his entire body shivered, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood as he shouted madly in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just you wait! I’ll fucking tear both of you apart and make you die a horrifying death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, you wouldn’t blame me for being impetuous, right?” Mu Kui turned around, and his expression had become naïve as he scratched his head and revealed a silly smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi smiled. “You didn’t kill him, so it can’t be considered to be impetuous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, I’ve caused trouble for you. Because of me, you’ve offended the Sikong Clan, you… You should leave Maple Leaf City quickly, as you’ll still be in time if you leave now.” Qin Yuwei spoke with a worried expression as she knew how terrifying the Sikong Clan was. The clan’s senior generation were all Rebirth Realm experts, and it even possessed a Nether Transformation Realm expert holding down the fort, causing its power to be monstrous and merely inferior to the Earthly Heaven Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As far as she was concerned, even though Chen Xi offending Sikong Hua wouldn’t draw out the senior generation of the Sikong Clan to make a move against him, yet an expert the Sikong Clan casually sent out would already be someone that Chen Xi couldn’t deal with, so she couldn’t help but be worried for him in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, my Young Miss isn’t wrong. You should leave quickly or it’ll be too late.” Luo Tong advised Chen Xi to leave as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi smiled yet neither approved nor disapproved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the attendant sent over the Ambergis as well. The Ambergis was a liquid that seemed like a pearl of water and was crystalline like amber. It was refined from Inkjade Bloodlotus, a piece of soul nurturing spirit wood, and another few more herbs, and it possessed the shocking effect of awakening one’s memories and repairing the soul. A single drop of Ambergis could be sold for 10,000 Nascent Condensation Pill on the market, but it was something that possessed a value yet had no stock, and it couldn’t be bought most of the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the Treasure Heaven Pavilion’s Ambergis was utterly not for sale, and it could only be exchanged for with Inkjade Bloodlotus or a piece of soul nurturing spirit wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, please wait. I have something to give you.” After he passed the Ambergis to Qin Yuwei, Chen Xi brought Mu Kui along to leave. However, he was stopped by Qin Yuwei before he could walk out of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young woman in a jade dress that possessed a delicate and beautiful appearance seemed to have made an extremely great resolution as she held out something that seemed like white jade and looked like a piece of a flat snow white bone with a cautious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a treasure passed down from the Ancestors of my Qin Clan, yet no one was capable of seeing through its secrets until now. Presently, my Qin Clan has declined and only this thing possesses slight worth in the remaining possessions of my Qin Clan. Senior, please accept it.” Qin Yuwei spoke with a resolute expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it’s something that’s passed down from generation to generation in your clan, you should keep it. I didn’t help you for the sake of your clan’s treasures.” Chen Xi shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, if you don’t accept it, then I’ll probably be unable to repay your life saving grace in the future. Could it be that you want me to live with an uneasy feeling for my entire life?” Qin Yuwei spoke as she shoved the thing in Chen Xi’s hand before leaving swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, time is of the essence. I and the Young Miss have to return and help the Patriarch first. If I have the chance, Luo Tong will repay your favor in the future.” Luo Tong cupped his hands with a solemn expression before chasing up to Qin Yuwei and leaving.</span></p>

They were dense like the starry sky and seemed as if they were talisman marking structures inscribed by Talisman Formation Masters, and they faintly seemed to emit a desolate and ancient voice that was chanting something that shook one’s soul.</span></p>

The third move, Infinite Obliteration, was in a blurred state, and he would be unable to pry into its profundities before his strength attained a certain level.</span></p>

He was already capable of utilizing the Dao Insights of Fire and Water in the move, Earthly Obliteration, but he still lacked some attainment, and he’d only grasped around 70% of its essence.</span></p>

Originally, he intended to utilize the Dao Insights of Yin and Yang in the second move of the Grand Obliteration Fist, yet no matter how he deduced it, he was unable to get the gist of it, causing him to be forced to temporarily lay it aside and place his entire mind on the first move, Earthly Obliteration.</span></p>

Under Chen Xi’s control, they revolved to form a flame vortex and water vortex, and a strand suction force was emitted from the two vortexes of elements of two extremes.</span></p>

When it arrived at a certain limit, the connection and equilibrium within this force field would be destroyed, causing water and fire to collide, and the collision of two extremes would produce an extremely terrifying explosive force!</span></p>
