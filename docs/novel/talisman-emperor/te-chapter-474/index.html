Brilliant glows of treasures would occasionally charge into the sky and draw the pursuit of group after group of genius experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These glows of treasures were treasures left behind by the gods, they were treasures left behind when the ancient gods went out on an expedition, and so long as one subdued a single one, it would sufficient to be boundlessly useful to any cultivator.</span></p>

He’d executed the Starsky Wings with his entire strength while flying at extreme speed in the boundless heavens and earth, and he was like a bolt of lightning or a strand of a translucent flowing light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His entire body was covered in blood and completely covered in cracks. His entire body was filled with a boundless and sharp burning pain, yet his expression was stiff and cold to the extreme, and it was as if he was a wooden puppet that didn’t know pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Piercingly cold gales blew onto his face and felt painful as if blades were slicing him, and it blew to the point his hair and bloodied clothes fluttered with the wind, yet it was incapable of blowing away the stubbornness and unyielding expression in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tribulation clouds in the sky enveloped his surroundings and accompanied him as he flashed in the sky, and the crimson red and dazzling bolts of lightning had transformed into a tiny world that emitted a destructive aura that intended to crush the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the might of the heavens, a punishment, and it was immeasurable and unfathomable. At this moment, it hung above the sky and hadn’t descended for a long time, causing it to seem like a blade that was pressed against one’s neck, a sharp sword that hung above one’s head, and it caused despair and uneasiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The secrets of the heavens, the Heaven Dao, the will of the heavens, the punishment of the heavens… Haha.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling tribulation lightning in the sky was reflected in Chen Xi’s eyes as the corners of his mouth were suffused with a trace of ridicule, and he seemed to be ridiculing the Heaven Dao yet also seemed as if he was ridiculing himself. But in next to no time, this wisp of ridiculing transformed into a wisp of resoluteness and ruthlessness</span></p>

The might of the Heavenly Tribulation lingered in the sky above him while formidable enemies pursued him beneath the skies. An unprecedentedly great pursuit had begun, and the entire Isle of Fallen Treasures was seething with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The news spread out in all directions and throughout the entire Primeval Battlefield, and it instantly gave rise to a mighty uproar as everyone was shocked.</span></p>

How shocking was this news? Yet the person who did this was only a young man, a lone young man that fought numerous enemies by himself and carried out a slaughter with unstoppable might.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he’d even obliterated Pei Yu’s Heavenly Immortal’s Decree, and such a ferocious and heaven defying ability even caused them to be flabbergasted and feel disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This matter gave rise to much discussion in the Primeval Battlefield and everyone was discussing it, causing the genius experts of the Darjin Dynasty who hadn’t entered the Isle of Fallen Treasures to be unable hold their heads up high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, Chen Xi had actually drawn the dual Rebirth Tribulations while being besieged by numerous experts and intended to advance to the Rebirth Realm in battle, and he’d even almost succeeded. Even though he failed on the verge of success in the end, this was even more shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, all the genius experts of the various Dynasties within the entire Primeval Battlefield had heard of this matter, and all of them were discussing it clamorously.</span></p>

After all, the genius experts that had perished at Chen Xi’s hand were merely a portion of all the genius experts from these Dynasties. At this moment, when they heard their companions had encountered difficulties, they naturally couldn’t stand idly by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great chaos quickly arose on the Isle of Fallen Treasures.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They’d sworn to not rest until they killed Chen Xi as they would be unable to eat and sleep in peace otherwise.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi hadn’t slept nor rested for a few days straight, as he’d always been fleeing. However, no matter where he went, his enemies would be able to catch up to him extremely quickly because the tribulation clouds had always enveloped the sky above his head, and it followed like an extremely conspicuous shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past few days, he’d encountered countless blockades and fought ceaseless battles, causing his entire body to be covered in blood. During the most severe encounters, he’d encountered Qin Xiao and Bi Lingyun, and the successive battles had caused his injuries to become even more severe and terrible, causing the vital energy within his body to be on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most terrifying of it all was the exit of the Isle of Fallen Treasures had been locked down and was guarded by numerous experts, so he was utterly incapable of retreating from the Isle of Fallen Treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This situation continued for half a month. During this period, Chen Xi’s Shaman Energy was on the verge of exhaustion, and he already lacked the strength to recover the injuries that covered his body. So at this moment, his body was tattered and covered in countless injuries, he could perish at any moment, and he was relying on his last breath to support himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, he’d escaped another pursuit and hid himself within a cavern in a mountain range before silently healing his injuries. His time was limited, and he had to make the best use of his time or his enemies would chase up once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He appeared to be like an injured lone wolf that was licking its wounds, wild, unyielding, and would never give up the hope of survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This mountain range was enveloped in mist, its sky had thunderstorms raging about it all year long, so hiding within it would allow him to conceal the expanse of tribulation clouds that he’d drawn out to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past few days, he’d always been pondering why the tribulation lightning hadn’t descended all this time. He’d seriously inferred and considered yet was never able to wrap his head around it, and it was even to the extent he started to suspect the tribulation was intentionally going against it. Otherwise, why hadn’t it descended until now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was anyone else, the person would have probably started to accept the test and transformation of the tribulation lightning on the exact same day it arrived, right? This sort of situation was too peculiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and started to inspect his injuries. The injuries his body had suffered were severe to the extreme and were almost irreparable. His body was tattered and coupled with the countless life and death battles he’d encountered during this half a month of time, the vital energy in his body had already weakened to the point of almost drying up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m really not resigned to this fate.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi muttered to himself. Even if it was at this moment, he didn’t believe he would be killed nor did he give up, and he was still healing his injuries while deducing the Rebirth Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another battle broke out two hours later, as his enemies had caught up, and Chen Xi fought desperately while bathed in blood to escape once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he escaped this time, he’d arrived at a swamp that was filled with poisonous bugs in the end. His entire body was torn apart like cotton fibers, and it seemed as if a gust of wind would be able to blow him apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fresh blood gurgled out and was absorbed by the foul smelling swamp beneath him, and his entire body seemed to be on the verge of being buried within the swamp.</span></p>

The sound of lightning that shook the surroundings seemed like the ridicule and mocking of the Heaven Dao, it was saw jarring and so infuriating.</span></p>

Impossible!” Chen Xi suddenly seemed like a trapped beast that was on the verge of death as he emitted an extremely hoarse roar from his throat, and he hysterically expended the last strand of strength within his entire body to struggle up and begin the final charge!</span></p>

The golden liquid within his Dantian was dark, mottled, and without the slightest vitality, and the Shaman Energy within his body was completely dried up and shriveled.</span></p>

He’d exhausted his last bit of strength and was completely exhausted of all energy, causing the vital energy in his entire body to dim down and be devoid of the slightest shred of strength.</span></p>

If one doesn’t lose his strength, one is unable to experience the tribulation, and the general idea of rebirth is probably like this.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Chen Xi muttered to himself as the Rebirth Wheel within his Dantian emanated a myriad of crimson brilliance that surged like wheels of flame, and it nurtured the vital energy in his entire body.</span></p>

He would have undoubtedly died under ordinary circumstances, and it was utterly impossible for him to survive. But at the instant he was on the brink of death, vitality had re-emerged and the situation had taken a turn, allowing him to complete the process of rebirth and experience a transformation of life itself that allowed his survival.</span></p>
