The air in her surroundings seemed to be fluctuating, and it seemed as if a special force was being developed there.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The arena beneath her feet shook as cracks appeared inch by inch out of nowhere. After that, the space Chen Xi was in instantly constricted and collapsed to form a cage formed from dazzling light, and it confined Chen Xi within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the vast and sacred seal that could prop up the heavens smashed down fiercely!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Instantly, the air shook violently as a terrifying collision force blasted out towards the surroundings, and it was as if a ripple that was filled with destructive force stretched out towards the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How tough were the light barrier in the surroundings of the arena, yet at this moment, it was unable to endure the combined destructive force of the two of them, and it exploded with a bang. Only now was the destructive airflow able to vent itself, and it was like a roaring and surging wave that charged into the other areas of the Devilbane Arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked at from afar, the entire Devilbane Arena was suffused with dust and dirt while rays of light fluttered in the sky, and it seemed as a scene of the end of the world.</span></p>

Since the Allstar Meeting started until now, it was the first time to the defensive barrier on the arena was blasted apart! The numerous battles before this were only barely capable of causing the light barrier to tremble intensely. This obviously displayed how terrifying the destructive force contained in Chen Xi and Qing Xiuyi’s attacks was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

The collision from before more or less had the intention of probing each other, and it wasn’t their strongest attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Light Dao Insight is really extraordinary.” Chen Xi felt enormous pressure for the first time, but the victor was unknown until he fought until the end.</span></p>

But unfortunately, you seem to have not attained that level. The strike from before was only a probing strike. I’ll allow you to understand what is called invincible next.”&nbsp;</span></p>

As for the final outcome, how can it be predicted until the end of the battle?” Chen Xi replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only a probing attack?”</span></p>

Yet when they heard them speak of it now, it was merely a probing attack, and it instantly caused everyone to be speechless.</span></p>

Her hands fluttered about to instantly overlap countless dense palm prints that instantly caused the sky to be covered with surging lights that transformed into strands of dazzling sword qi, and they were like spirit serpents that twisted, wriggled, and intertwined together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These strands of light energy contained an extremely terrifying blazing purification energy of light, and it shot out explosively to instantly cover Chen Xi’s body and wanted to bore into every single aperture on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Chen Xi resign himself to death? He grunted coldly as raging storm instantly arose around his body, and then the Talisman Armament revolved like a top, causing all the strands of light to be shaken to the point they shattered into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what Chen Xi never imagined was that this energy of light that was shattered didn’t dissipate, and they instead instantly transformed into a translucent palm print that fiercely slapped onto his Talisman Armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

It shook Chen Xi to the point he couldn’t stand stably and was actually blasted flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when his vital energy and blood was roiling, and he hadn’t recovered, Qing Xiuyi arrived as if she’d passed through space before slapping her palm down like a cattail leaf fan towards his head. Her fingers were crystalline and translucent, and they emitted extremely dazzling light energy that guaranteed her palm would be capable of smashing Chen Xi’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s body went cold as he executed the Starsky Wings with his full strength, and then he turned and flew like an unreal wisp of smoke to instantly dodge this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi pounced over once more when her attack missed, light flowed around her as her clothed fluttered with the wind, and she was like a Queen of Light that wanted to purify the world as she struck out with a killing move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi had relied on the extremely profound Starsky Wings to dodge it. Moreover, he’d seized this opportunity to recover to his peak state once more, and then his gaze flashed as he ferociously launched a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually have the audacity to launch a counterattack?” Qing Xiuyi’s eyes squinted as the aura on her entire body grew stronger. She was unable to tolerate that Chen Xi had resolved his situation of passively receiving attacks like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“World Illumination!” She cried out loudly and clearly as surging flames of light lit ablaze on her delicate hands, and it was dazzling and resplendent as if she controlled two brilliant suns that leaped about. Her palms overlapped each other, and it carried a terrifying feeling of being able to purify, annihilate, and obliterate a person.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Palm and sword collided, caused boundless brilliant lights to explode out, and two figures moved freely on the arena as they fought intensely. One had Sword Insight that shot into the sky, the other flowed with light, and the situation of the battle was unprecedentedly horrifying, causing all the surrounding people to be shocked by the sight of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, Chen Xi and Qing Xiuyi had exchanged over 100 blows, and he felt as if Qing Xiuyi’s strength was growing stronger and stronger to the point of almost suffocating him, whereas the sword moves of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture was about to collapse at any moment. Only now did he know what a terrifying strength a rare Grand Dao Insight like Light possessed.</span></p>

Her martial techniques are extraordinary, whereas her combat style is resolute and straightforward, and it carries a strong and unshakable confidence. Even I don’t dare say I’m capable of confidently defeating a person like this, and it’s even to the extent I’m not the slightest bit sure that I can win…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it’s precisely because of this that it’s challenging. Only an opponent like this can allow me to break through my limits. Once I defeat her, not only will I be able to obtain first place and reunite with An’er, perhaps my cultivation will obtain an extremely great benefit as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, Chen Xi’s heart was even more firm, pure, clear, and translucent. He stopped considering anything else, stopped considering success and failure. He only had a single objective — defeat his opponent!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi’s soul seemed to have obtained a rise, causing his entire bearing to change. His bearing lost a trace of resoluteness and ruthless, and it gained calmness and vitality, whereas, his eyes were clear yet deep like the starry sky in the depths of the universe.</span></p>

Each sword light linked with another and were interwoven flawlessly, causing them to be filled with a feeling of perfect circulation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, the sword moves Chen Xi sprayed out were like a surging and magnificent painting. Storms gathered, lightning lay across the sky, starry flames flowed, a myriad of plants flourished, mountains and marshes alternated… A myriad of scenes formed into a perfect and harmonious scene that was magnificent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sky, Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Mountain, Marsh, Lightning.</span></p>

Every single sword light was so pure, yet once it was executed, it contained an infinite amount of variations.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was immersed in a strange state. It was as if the eight great sword moves of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture were having fun, chasing each other, and combining, and everything seemed natural and utterly didn’t require him to intentionally think which sword move he should use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All complication was shed to return to simplicity as the Dao was always boundless and natural!</span></p>

It’s natural, flawless, and without the slightest trace of being executed artificially. Such a sword technique can really be called a technique that had been derived from nature yet fused with nature, and it points straight towards the essence of the Sword Dao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone including the Earthly Immortal Realm experts exclaimed with heartfelt admiration. Every single sword move of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture that Chen Xi executed was completely different, yet combined with each other while containing various Dao Insights, and it was simply like the tune of nature. Sometimes gentle like a whisper, sometimes loud and resounding, sometimes continuous and dense like a drizzle, sometimes vast and powerful like a great river…and it possessed an imposing aura that shook one’s heart and soul.</span></p>

So how could it not cause everyone to be shocked and sigh with admiration?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eight moves combined into one, a myriad of changes converged into a single strike! This little fellow’s natural talent is shocking indeed. Possessing such an outstanding talent is the fortune of my Darchu Dynasty!” High above in the sky, the eyes of Emperor Chu opened and closed as a trace of heartfelt praise flashed in the depths of his eyes.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
