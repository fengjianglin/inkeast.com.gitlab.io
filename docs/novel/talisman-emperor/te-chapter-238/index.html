 <p>Chapter 238 – Yue Qi Making A Name For Himself</p>
 <p>Zhen Liuqing seemed to have not noticed the shock of the surrounding people as she stood up by herself and straightened out her dress, and she nodded her head and said as she passed by Huangfu Chongming, “Young Prince, I wonder if an outcome like this has caused you to be disappointed?”</p>
 <p>“Miss Zhen’s comprehension ability is extraordinary, and you deserve your reputation.” Huangfu Chongming smiled, but his smile seemed to be slightly forced. Obviously, being forced down by Zhen Liuqing caused him to be extremely displeased as well.</p>
 <p><i>Extraordinary. This woman doesn’t seem to be the slightest bit inferior to Qing Xiuyi… </i>Chen Xi sighed endlessly with emotion in his heart as he watched the events unfold. He was extremely curious that if Qing Xiuyi was here, what outcome would be measured by the Dao Measuring Stone?</p>
 <p>Subsequently, it was An Qianyu and Wang Daoxu that were measured. These two people had already been restraining themselves since a long time ago, and it was precisely for the sake of amazing everyone at the last moment.</p>
 <p>The outcome appeared quickly. Both of them possessed 14 Dao Insights and were still inferior to Huangfu Chongming by a single Dao Insight. This outcome caused the two of them to be slightly displeased, as when they considered it carefully, they were only equal to Liu Fengchi and Man Hong, let alone comparing with Zhen Liuqing that was ranked at the top.</p>
 <p>But this outcome still caused a wave of shocked exclamations from the surroundings, and it slightly eased up the depression in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Up until now, the rankings of the test could already be roughly ordered in the hearts of everyone. Zhen Liuqing was ranked first and Huangfu Chongming was second. Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, An Qianyu, and Wang Daoxu were equal and could be temporarily ranked as the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth.</p>
 <p>The remaining people were Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, and Pei Zhong, who similarly possessed 13 Dao Insights, and they could be ranked as number seven, eight, and nine.</p>
 <p>In this way, Xue Chen, who possessed 12 Dao Insights, had been squeezed out from the top nine rankings now, and he had no fortune to obtain a Dao Insight Origin Pill as a prize.</p>
 <p>This caused Xue Chen’s expression to become exceedingly unsightly. As far as he was concerned, if it wasn’t for An Qianyu and Wang Daoxu appeared at the last moment, there would absolutely be a place for him amongst the top 10, and it was precisely because of this knot in his heart that the depression in his heart was obvious.</p>
 <p><i>I’ve currently mastered 13 Dao Insights. Logically speaking, I ought to be more or less equal to Lin Moxuan and the others. Unfortunately, the nine positions have already been filled. I wonder if I can blast my way in… </i>Chen Xi was silently calculating in his heart.</p>
 <p>Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</p>
 <p>A wave of footsteps sounded out, and even though the sound was slight, yet in this deathly silent atmosphere, it instantly jolted the people who were pondering back to their senses. When they raised their heads to look, they saw Yue Qi who had an ordinary appearance and no reputation walking towards the Equipment Emperor’s Dao Measuring Stone.</p>
 <p>Only now did everyone realize that there were still two people that hadn’t been measured yet!</p>
 <p>They couldn’t be blamed for leaving out Chen Xi and Yue Qi. After all, one of these two people only possessed a cultivation at the perfection-stage of the Golden Hall Realm, and the other had no reputation and was too ordinary. Compared to the outstanding figures of the younger generation dazzling and well renowned, these two people were indeed extremely easy to be overlooked.</p>
 <p>When he saw Yue Qi walk forward, Chen Xi couldn’t help but feel a wave of helplessness in his heart. He was originally thinking of going up first, yet never had he imagined that this fellow would be a step ahead of him.</p>
 <p>“Alas, this fellow still isn’t giving up. The top nine are already set in stone, what’s the point of undergoing the measurement?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t look down on this person. This fellow fought his way into the twelfth position in the first test and obtained a Dao Grade martial technique. Perhaps he’s a dark horse.”</p>
 <p>“Dark horse? Hmph! If his comprehension in Dao Insight is shocking, I’m afraid he would be renowned in the world since long ago. Did you no see that even the Whitecrane Sect’s Golden Core Realm Core Disciple, Xue Chen, has been forced down? No matter how formidable he is, can he compare to Xue Chen?”</p>
 <p>“Shut up and watch him undergo the measurement. We can’t enter the grounds of the third test without waiting for him and that kid at the Golden Hall Realm to undergo their measurements.”</p>
 <p>When faced with the animated discussion of everyone, Yue Qi still had a stiff expression as he silently sat cross-legged under the Dao Measuring Stone and closed his eyes without saying a word.</p>
 <p>Om!</p>
 <p>A shocking scene appeared. The instant Yue Qi sat down, numerous divine lights seemed as if they’d gone mad as they sprayed out from above him to appear on the surface of the Dao Measuring Stone.</p>
 <p>In only an instant, 15 Dao Insights had actually appeared. It completely surpassed Lin Moxuan’s group and Liu Fengchi’s group to be equal with Huangfu Chongming, and it was only a single Dao Insight inferior to Zhen Liuqing!</p>
 <p>Everyone instantly went into an uproar when they saw this outcome, and all of them almost didn’t dare believe their eyes. There was only a single thought within their hearts. <i>A dark horse! This kid is absolutely a dark horse!</i></p>
 <p>Huangfu Chongming was stunned, and he started to size up Yue Qi, whose rank was equal to himself, for the first time.</p>
 <p>Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, An Qianyu, and Wang Daoxu instantly became surprised and bewildered, and just like Huangfu Chongming, the four of them quickly pondered about Yue Qi’s origins. <i>The northern barbaric lands’ Ancientmoon Sect? When did such an extraordinary genius appear in a sect like this?</i></p>
 <p>On the other hand, the expressions of Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, and Pei Zhong darkened instantly. Yue Qi’s appearance had caused their rankings to be in placed in jeopardy. If nothing unexpected occurred, then one of them would surely be eliminated. An outcome like this was something that none of them were willing to see.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! I, Yue Qi, have cultivated 19 years, and I concealed my ability and endured by every means just for the sake of making a name for myself at this moment and to spread my name throughout the world. Now I’ve finally achieved it. Not only have I obtained a Dao Grade martial technique, I even possess the qualification to obtain a Dao Insight Origin Pill. I’m bound to yield brilliant results during the Allstar Meeting five years from now and cause all the cultivators in the world to be shocked!” Yue Qi stood up from under the Dao Measuring Stone and laughed loudly towards the sky. His sedate and ordinary face actually revealed a frenzied and warped expression, and he seemed to be extremely insane and arrogant. He was simply like a different person when compared to the young man that had no reputation from before.</p>
 <p>No one spoke when they saw this scene. Perhaps they detested this fellow that had two faces in their hearts, but they were unable to refute his words. Because after this incident and once they left Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault, Yue Qi’s name was bound to be noticed by the various large powers of the Darchu Dynasty and become one of the high and mighty influential figures of the younger generation.</p>
 <p><i>Enduring bitterly all for the sake of a vain piece of reputation. Why bother? </i>Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh in his heart, and the slight favorable impression he had of Yue Qi vanished.</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi, you kid! What are you standing there for? Why are you wasting the time of everyone? Can you undertake the responsibility for such a crime? Quickly undergo the measurement!” Right at this moment, Liu Fengchi suddenly turned around to look unhappily at Chen Xi as he grunted coldly.</p>
 <p>When they saw Liu Fengchi speak out, Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, Man Hong, and the others started laughing coldly without end as well, and the gazes they shot at Chen Xi completely revealed their deep hatred towards him.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for them being unable to fight during the tests, they’d probably have killed Chen Xi long ago.</p>
 <p><i>This kid seems to have offended many people?</i></p>
 <p>The eyesight of every single person present was exceedingly discerning, and they acutely noticed that Chen Xi seemed to have an irreconcilable enmity between Huangfu Chongming and the others.</p>
 <p>They couldn’t help but feel a wave of curiosity in their hearts. <i>This kid is only at the Golden Hall Realm, so how could he possibly offend so many experts of the younger generation, yet still be living until now?</i></p>
 <p>Even Zhen Liuqing couldn’t help but be surprised. She originally thought that Chen Xi had only offended Huangfu Chongming and Liu Fengchi, yet never had she imagined that he’d actually he’d even offended another few more experts of the younger generation?</p>
 <p><i>This fellow is really interesting… </i>Zhen Liuqing was even more curious about Chen Xi. She really wanted to know how a fellow with a cultivation at the Golden Hall Realm was able to live until now after offending so many experts of the younger generation. Moreover, he seemed to be living comfortably.</p>
 <p>When faced with a variety of gazes from everyone, Chen Xi’s expression remained unmoved as he glanced indifferently at Huangfu Chongming and the others before silently walking forward to arrive before the Dao Measuring Stone, and then he sat down cross-legged. From the beginning until the end, he didn’t reveal a trace of cowardice or anger, and he had a carefree expression.</p>
 <p><i>Nevermind. No matter if I’m able to charge into the top nine or not, being able to experience the wonders of the Equipment Emperor’s Dao Measuring Stone isn’t bad as well… </i>Chen Xi cleared his mind as he slowly closed his eyes.</p>
