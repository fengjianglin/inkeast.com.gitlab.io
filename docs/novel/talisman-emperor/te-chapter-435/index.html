 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This has already surpassed the might of an earth-rank and even heaven-rank magic treasure, yet its might was slightly inferior to an Immortal Artifact, and it was difficult to imagine exactly what sort of magic treasure this was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be a Quasi Immortal Artifact?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A flash of insight appeared in Chen Xi’s mind as he suddenly recalled that there was a type of magic treasure whose might had entirely surpassed heaven-rank magic treasures, but because they were unable to produce Artifact Spirits, they were only called Quasi Immortal Artifacts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though its name wasn’t so impressive as an Immortal Artifact, its might was extremely great. In the Darchu Dynasty, only those Earthly Immortal Realm experts that commanded the winds and clouds possessed Quasi Immortal Artifacts, whereas it was utterly impossible for other cultivators to obtain one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, only the Supreme Elder Bei Heng possessed a Quasi Immortal Artifact, the Fifth-Earth Mirror. Moreover, it was the one and only Quasi Immortal Artifact in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, thus it obviously showed how rare Quasi Immortal Artifacts were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But aren’t only cultivations at the Nether Transformation Realm and above capable of utilizing a Quasi Immortal Artifacts?” This was the thing that bewildered Chen Xi. Because Xu Lengye was only at the perfection-stage of the Golden Core Realm, and if he was using a Quasi Immortal Artifact, then it would be simply unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot, any magic treasure can be utilized under the Laws of the Heaven Dao in the Primeval Battlefield, and it isn’t restrained since long ago. You actually don’t even know this? You don’t deserve becoming a servant of this Young Master, now come receive your death!” When he saw Chen Xi seeming to be shocked by his attack, Xu Lengye raised his chin and laughed in disdain, yet he wasn’t slow in the slightest to swing out the flaming fan in his hand once again, causing a flaming glow to cover the heavens and the earth as it crushed down fiercely onto Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it’s caused by the difference in the Laws of the Heaven Dao? In this way, it’s indeed a Quasi Immortal Artifact that’s in the hands of this fellow…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi came to a complete understanding, yet his heart sank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, there wasn’t any magic treasure in his possession that was capable of going against a Quasi Immortal Artifact. But this fellow was only at the Golden Core Realm, so even if he was able to utilize a Quasi Immortal Artifact, he was probably far from being capable of bringing forth its entire might…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi swiftly pondered towards a countermeasure. In the next moment, Chen Xi had already executed the Starsky Wings to dodge far away to the side. It was better to avoid the flaming fan until he figured out its might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the speed of the Starsky Wings was sufficiently swift, and he moved 500km in the blink of an eye. Even though the might of Xu Lengye’s flaming fan was great, it was unable to lock down Chen Xi’s path of retreat, and it was even to the extent that so long as Chen Xi willed it, he would even be able to escape easily at this moment and didn’t have to worry about suffering from any misfortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A flaming glow suffused the sky, causing the heavens and the earth to be tainted in an expanse of fiery red, and it was like a volcano had erupted, causing flames to flow out in all directions. Amongst the two of them, one attacked while the other defended, and they moved freely in an area of a few tens of thousands of kilometers, causing the area of the battlefield to grow larger and larger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! Fight me head on if you have the balls!” When he saw his attacks being constantly avoided by Chen Xi, Xu Lengye was furious to the point of shouting out repeatedly. His figure flashed through the sky like the god of flame that had descended to the world, and the flaming fan in his hand swung out repeatedly, causing vast flaming waves that covered the heavens and the earth to surge out like a roiling ocean that was pouring down from high above in the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

His figure moved indeterminately like a flowing light in the starry sky, and he moved about while always barely avoiding the attacks. He was like a slippery loach that angered Xu Lengye to the point of going on a rampage and chasing him even more desperately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They fought freely in the sky and ceaselessly changed their battlefield, causing them to seem extremely conspicuous in this region that was filled with violet colored thunderstorms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A total of 16 young geniuses from the Full Moon Kingdom have entered the Primeval Battlefield this time, but only Xu Lengye possesses a Quasi Immortal Artifact, Flaming Peacock Fan. Looks like that person is the Eldest Prince of the Full Moon Kingdom, Xu Lengye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Quasi Immortal Artifact! A rare magic treasure that would cause even the eyes of Earthly Immortal Realm experts to go red with covetous intentions. I heard that only the extreme core disciples of the other Dynasties have brought Quasi Immortal Artifacts along. I wonder if it’s true. We have to avoid this fellow if we encounter him in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a mountain in the extreme distance, there were two young men standing side by side, and they looked at the battle between Chen Xi and Xu Lengye from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! If he doesn’t have a sufficient strength, then even if he possesses a precious treasure like a Quasi Immortal Artifact, it would only bring him harm and benefit others.” The person that spoke was the young man in the lead. His appearance was handsome and dignified, his eyes deep like the starry sky, and his bearing was graceful and steady. he stood there with his hands behind his back as his black hair fluttered, and he revealed lofty heroism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Wei Kong, what you mean is Xu Lengye might lose?” The other young man was surprised. His eyes were narrow and long, his expression sinister, and his eyes emanated bright lights, causing him to seem extremely cruel. There was a short halberd suffused with an azure sheen laying slanted on his back, and its cold aura emitted a trace of ruthlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not might, but surely.” Wei Kong spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his eyes were always staring at Chen Xi who was in the distant battle. “Cheng Feng, look. Does this opponent of Xu Lengye look like the first in the Darchu Dynasty’s Allstar Meeting, Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi?” Cheng Feng’s eyes narrowed, and then he nodded and said, “Based on the information obtained from the Blacksun Pavilion, this kid ought to be Chen Xi without a doubt. Amongst the numerous young geniuses of the various Dynasties that had entered the Primeval Battlefield this time, only this fellow has cultivated the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture to the level of combining all eight sword moves into one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, Cheng Feng seemed to have recalled something, and he laughed gloomily. “I heard that the disciples of many Dynasties that have a feud with the Darchu Dynasty have spread the word that they would annihilate all the Darchu Dynasty’s disciples that have entered into the Primeval Battlefield. There’s no lack of first-rate Dynasties like the Darqian Dynasty and Darxuan Dynasty amongst them. As the number one figure in the younger generation of the Darchu Dynasty, Chen Xi will probably be unable to leave the Primeval Battlefield with his life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Kong sighed lightly and said, “Yeah, if it wasn’t because of this, I was thinking of pulling Chen Xi into out group and wandering about together…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice stopped here abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because, at this moment, a flowing light suddenly tore through the horizon as it flew over and was caught by Wei Kong, and he couldn’t help but frown after he swept it with his Divine Sense. “Let’s go. Senior Brother Qin Xiao sent a message and asked us to swiftly converge with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Qin Xiao?” Cheng Feng was shocked, and his voice actually revealed a trace of dense reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Kong nodded. “There’s no time to lose, let’s go right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Wei Kong, wait a moment.” Cheng Feng said abruptly, “That Xu Lengye has a Quasi Immortal Artifact in his possession, why don’t we…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think I want to give up after watching them fight for so long?” Wei Kong shook his head and sighed as he said, “Let’s go. That Chen Xi is a hard piece of flesh, don’t fall to the extent of being unable to swallow it and even die trying. That wouldn’t be worth it.”</span></p>

We found an opportunity where Xu Lengye was alone with great difficulty, yet it’s going to benefit this kid, Chen Xi!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Cheng Feng glanced at the distant battle with unwillingness in his heart, and then he turned around and left along with Wei Kong.</span></p>

Early on at the beginning of the battle with Xu Lengye, he’d already noticed the existence of Wei Kong and Cheng Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this that he’d always been holding back. He only locked himself in battle with Xu Lengye while avoiding Xu Lengye’s attacks, as he was worried that someone would forcefully interfere at the critical moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, as soon as these two people left, it caused Chen Xi to be completely at ease.</span></p>

Utilizing a Quasi Immortal Artifact repeatedly with his cultivation had caused his strength to be almost completely exhausted now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi suddenly stood still, and then the Talisman Armament soared through the sky as he slashed out with the strike he’d accumulated strength for since long ago.</span></p>

There were stars circulating, the five elements alternating, wind and lightning surging, and rows of mountains within it, and the magnificent and unbelievable scene seemed like it was during the time the heavens and earth were split open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shit!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Lengye swiftly retreated as great terror arose in his heart. He’d relied on the Quasi Immortal Artifact, Flaming Peacock Fan, to be barely able to fight Chen Xi equally. Now, when he sensed the exceedingly terrifying might contained within this strike, how could he dare stand and fight?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was a step too slow, and the vast Sword Insight charged and swept over like a sea of stars.</span></p>

This Young Master won’t let you off!” Xu Lengye roared repeatedly with rage from his pain, and he was terrified to the point his soul almost left his body. At this urgent moment where his life was on the line, he couldn’t be bothered to pick up his treasured fan, and he crushed a Universe Teleportation Talisman, causing his entire body to be teleported away and vanish with a swish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the moment Chen Xi slashed out with this strike, to the moment Xu Lengye’s right arm was severed, and then to the moment he crushed the Universe Teleportation Talisman. This entire series of movements had happened in a mere instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi caught up, there was already no trace of Xu Lengye.</span></p>

Looks like this fellow’s clan is really well-off… Unfortunately, he escaped. I wonder what other formidable treasures he has in his possession…?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed with emotion in his heart, and then he flashed to the ground. With a flick of his sleeve, he’d swept up the Flaming Peacock Fan that had fallen on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he executed the Starsky Wings to turn around and return to the mountain where the Lightning Orchid was, and then he carefully gathered this spirit herb before swiftly leaving without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commotion caused by the earlier battle between him and Xu Lengye was too great, and it was utterly impossible for it to be concealed from others. Not to mention this was the extremely dangerous Primeval Battlefield, so it was better to leave swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After flying for an entire two hours, to Chen Xi’s surprise, he still hadn’t left this thunderstorm region, and violet colored violent thunderstorms and lightning bolts still surged in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This won’t do! If I continue flying aimlessly like this, then not to mention the exhaustion of my strength, I’ll probably encounter other dangers. After all, this is the Primeval Battlefield that I’m unfamiliar of, and it’s filled with danger. So I must not be careless…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After flying for another 10 more minutes, Chen Xi finally found a place he could reside in temporarily. This was an extremely inconspicuous and small mountain. It was 3km in height, and there was a natural cave on the jagged mountain wall on one of its sides. The cave was utterly pitch black and difficult to recognize, and it was extremely easy to overlook it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not bad. I only need to set up an Illusory Formation, and I ought to not have to worry about being noticed by the others…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi flashed in without the slightest hesitation and sized it up briefly, and when he confirmed there wasn’t any danger, he walked in along the cave passageway.</span></p>
