 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin and the others set up camp on a plain and rested briefly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place was already close to the central area of the Bloodlands, and amongst the various area of the Bloodlands, the central area and sky area was the most adverse and dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two areas didn’t just have adverse environments, there were many spatial rifts and temporal storms scattered around these areas. Most importantly, Golden Immortal Realm Cosmos Beasts and Xeno-race experts resided here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally speaking, no one would head to the central area or sky area to take a risk during the early stages of the second round of the test. Even if it was the last stages of the test, only the disciples of the top powers would enter these two areas in groups, and their objective was naturally to earn even more Starpoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because even though these two areas were extremely dangerous, the Starpoints earned from the Cosmos Beasts and Xeno-race experts was extremely shocking in number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely because of this that the central and sky areas were usually the stage where the disciples of the top powers fought and competed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because all of them would choose to enter these two areas during the last stages of the test, so competition and slaughter naturally couldn’t be avoided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the veil of the night, Zuoqiu Yin raised his head to look towards a distant mountain. A figure could be faintly seen to be residing there, and it was Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He really is like an evil spirit that refuses to go away!” Zuoqiu Yin muttered with an extremely complicated feeling in his heart. He was originally the hunter while Chen Xi was the hunted, yet their roles had changed now, and they’d become the hunted while Chen Xi had become the hunter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grievance, frustration, resentment, rage, and unwillingness were accumulated in his heart, causing Zuoqiu Yin to actually feel powerless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath and tried his best to calm his feelings before he swept his companions with his gaze. He saw that even though their expressions were vigilant, a wisp of exhaustion and dejection was impossible to be concealed from the space between their brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused Zuoqiu Yin’s heart to sink. He was very well aware that if this sort of state were to continue, then even if they entered the central area, the situation they were in would only become more and more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I must find a method to eliminate this kid, Chen Xi! But…how exactly should I do it?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin had almost split his head from thinking about this in the past few days, yet he was unable to think of any method that could deal with Chen Xi because Chen Xi didn’t approach them at all. He always stayed 500km away while launching sneak attacks with the Dao of Archery against them from time to time. This sort of feeling where he was unable to pursue or get away from Chen Xi was simply on the verge of driving him insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of a snow white and bright ray of flowing light flashed in the darkness. In the next moment, it had appeared before Zuoqiu Yin. Surprisingly, it was the Devilsow Bird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin couldn’t help but reveal an embarrassed expression when he saw the Devilsow Bird. “I’m sorry, I disappointed your master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devilsow Bird sighed faintly. “Master is already aware of the situation all of you are in. Don’t worry, from tomorrow onward, the disciples of the Jiang Clan, the Dragon Dimension, and the Wenren Clan will come to your aid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin was shocked in his head, and the embarrassment on his face grew deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, the disciples of their Zuoqiu Clan were existences that could compare with the disciples of the Jiang Clan and the Dragon Dimension, yet now, for the sake of dealing with just a single person, their Zuoqiu Clan was forced to seek assistance from other powers, and this was an enormous humiliation by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Wenren Clan, even though they couldn’t compare to powers like the seven great ancient clans, they were a top-rate power in Icesky Continent. Their forces were so powerful that they were on par with the Zuoqiu Clan, and they were only inferior to the Zuoqiu Clan in terms of resources and reserves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the difference between an ancient clan and a new and developing power. Their forces were equivalent, yet only their resources and reserves were different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It just so happened that their Zuoqiu Clan had to seek assistance from the Wenren Clan now, and it was like a noble clan was seeking assistance from a nouveau riche, causing Zuoqiu Yin to feel even more uncomfortable in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he had no choice before reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master paid an extremely great price for this. Don’t let Master down in the following actions you take.” The Devilsow Bird croaked. “However, all of you don’t have to feel responsible because of this matter. Presently, all the powers in the Bloodlands are clearly aware that Chen Xi possesses over 9,000 Starpoints, and he’s temporarily ranked first. He has become the fragrant piece of meat in the eyes of everyone, and they intend to kill him and obtain the Starpoints he possesses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devilsow Bird paused for a moment and continued. “Moreover, I’ve done as my Master instructed and spread the news that Chen Xi’s in this area. If nothing unexpected happens, then many powers will come over from tomorrow onwards after they hear the news. At that time, the situation Chen Xi’s in will be no different than that of a rat running across a street.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin’s spirits were greatly refreshed while his eyes lit up when he heard this, and then he cupped his hands and said, “Thank you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Devilsow Bird didn’t speak any further. It spread its wings and swiftly transformed into a wisp of white light that vanished into the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be on full alert! It won’t be long before that kid won’t have another chance to appear before us!” Zuoqiu Yin took a deep breath and swiftly sent a voice transmission to the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirits of everyone were instantly refreshed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these past few days, they’d been tormented by Chen Xi who was like a plague to the point living was worse than death. At this moment, when they found out about all of this, they couldn’t help but be extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The depression that had been accumulated in Zuoqiu Yin’s heart for a long time eased up greatly when he saw this, and then he raised his head to look at the faintly visible figure in the extreme distance while a wisp of coldness couldn’t help but suffuse the corners of his mouth. “You ant! Let me see how long more you can live!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a wisp of flowing light suddenly shot out violently from the distance. It was sharp, murderous, precise, and carried an all-powerful and terrifying aura as it shot violently at Zuoqiu Yin’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The coldness on Zuoqiu Yin’s face grew deeper when faced with this. Chen Xi had done this frequently in these past few days, and he launched a few sneak attacks from time to time not for the sake of killing the members of the Zuoqiu Clan but to wear out their will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Zuoqiu Yin knew this, he wasn’t slow at all to flash and dodge this attack with ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrow formed from an immortal sword missed, and it crushed a rock, causing fragments to shoot into the surroundings while a horrifying rift appeared on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A nearby Zuoqiu Clan disciple said, “Big Brother Yin, be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! It’s only the same tricks as before, there’s no need to be nervous.” Zuoqiu Yin’s voice hadn’t finished resounding through the air when a bright light suddenly flashed in his field of vision as another ‘arrow’ tore through the sky. His reaction was extremely swift, and he easily avoided it by flashing to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this arrow wasn’t aimed at him, and it shot towards a pool of foul water at the side. An explosion that shook the heavens erupted from the pool of foul water, and then a large amount of stinking and repulsive water sprayed out and into the surroundings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The might this water carried was only ordinary, and it was utterly incapable of doing anything to Zuoqiu Yin and the others. However, as soon as it spread throughout the air, it instantly emanated an extremely stinking smell, and it was top-rate in terms of being disgusting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“See, this kid can only play small tricks like these now.” Zuoqiu Yin frowned. His nose was filled with a disgusting smell, yet he wouldn’t get infuriated any more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan roared with laughter when they heard this, and they were much more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin laughed lightly as well, and he mocked. “That kid is launching sneak attacks all the time that we’ve already gathered over thirty immortal swords from him. Don’t all of you think that he’s like a kid that gives out free wealth?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is.” The others spoke in unison before roaring endlessly with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of the sound of the air being torn apart resounded. This time, it wasn’t a single arrow but over ten. Every single one was like a wisp of light that tore open the darkness as it whistled over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin and the others were prepared a long time ago, and they easily avoided these attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“See, that kid became angry from embarrassment!” Zuoqiu Yin mocked once more while the others laughed even more wildly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, to their surprise, Chen Xi seemed to be acting slightly unusually today. Up until now, he didn’t show any intent of stopping, and he shot out numerous arrows successively instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single arrow was like a shooting star that tore through the space as it descended, and the sharp and ear piercing howls they emanated were like a tide that resounded through the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow really is giving out free wealth!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! That’s good as well. This kid possesses so many immortal swords, and it can be considered to be valuable loot from the battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has this idiot finally lost his patience after following us for a few days and realizing he’s unable to do anything to us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clansmen of the Zuoqiu Clan ridiculed Chen Xi as they dodged the sharp rain of arrows that assaulted them. Their voices were rather loud and reverberated through the heavens and the earth as if they were deeply afraid that Chen Xi who was 500km away would be unable to hear it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s better to be careful. I feel that this kid is acting too unusually tonight. He seems as if he’s intending to execute some sort of crafty scheme.” One of them warned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin’s eyes narrowed when he heard this, and he suddenly realized something. It seemed to be much easier for them to dodge this rain of arrows than it was in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, why do I feel that these arrows aren’t flying towards us at all? That kid’s standard in the Dao of Archery is too terrible tonight.” Someone else muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin’s heart jerked as soon as these words were spoken, and then his gaze swiftly swept the surroundings.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The location those arrows descended seem to be slightly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could figure it out, a bang that sounded like a thunderclap suddenly resounding in the heavens and the earth. A brilliant, vast, and peerlessly dazzling arrow tore through the eternal night and soared through the sky like a wisp of the day had suddenly descended within the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This strike was even more terrifying than all the attacks from before. Its aura was piercingly cold while its killing intent was almost material, and it carried a terrifying force that struck the heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, this attack was still not shot towards any one of them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What exactly is this fellow doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of them were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, coldness suddenly emerged from Zuoqiu Yin’s heart as he shouted in a grim voice. “Quickly! Quickly leave this place! That kid is setting up a formation with these arrows!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was like a thunderclap that revealed a strand of shock and rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan were horrified. Unfortunately, they heard an enormous bang rumble before they could take any action. The arrow that was brilliant like the arrival of daytime had forcefully pierced through the ground. At this moment, the ground in an area of 500km started to quake violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, numerous beams of brilliant white light shot into the sky within an area of 500km, and they were like numerous snow white and thick chains that reached the sky. They fluttered throughout the sky and enveloped that entire expanse of the heavens and the earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, this area was filled with vast white light, and it was extremely dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Astral Whitebale Formation is finally complete…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the extreme distance, Chen Xi muttered with a ghastly pale and practically translucent countenance, yet the space between his brows revealed a relaxed expression.</span></p>
