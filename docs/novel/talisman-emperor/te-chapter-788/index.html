 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the heavens and the earth seemed to have fallen into a terrifying and ghastly hell.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of everyone trembled when they saw this scene. On one hand, they were shocked by how resolutely Chen Xi acted, and on the other hand, they were terrified by how great this glow of sin was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, if such energy of sin were to spread out, the myriad of lives in the entire Corona City would be tainted, have their souls seized, and perish on the spot.</span></p>

But when they noticed that glow of sin that shot into the sky, both of them couldn’t help but be moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They practically didn’t hesitate in the slightest to open their mouths at the same time and suck fiercely like a whale taking water in, and the glow of sin that covered the sky rumbled as if transformed into torrents that charged towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The glow of sin was undoubtedly a greatly beneficial thing to evil cultivators like them, and it was like how righteous cultivators consumed immortal wine. It possessed unbelievable benefits to their cultivations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huai Ming and Bei Huang even firmly believed that so long as they completely absorbed the glow of sin from Huo Yi and the others, they would even be able to charge into the next level of the Earthly Immortal Realm in a short period of time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was the energy of sin that had been condensed throughout the lifetime of three Earthly Immortal Realm experts, so how could it possibly be ordinary?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

After that, a golden lotus platform that was like a mountain floated up into appearance, and it radiated a myriad of dazzling golden light and emanated waves of the sound of Buddhist chanting, causing it to seem like the chanting of the gods and the rumbling of the Grand Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the entire heavens and earth surged with a grand aura of eliminating all sin and cleansing all evil.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as this golden lotus platform appeared, the jet black glow of sin the enveloped the heavens and the earth was like the night that had encountered the radiance of the sun, like snow melting in boiling water, and it emitted waves of extremely ear piercing and miserable shrill cries that seemed like it was howling for mercy and struggling to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, under the illumination of the golden light from the lotus platform, all of this was futile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present could clearly see that the vengeful spirits, ghosts, evil creatures, and so on and so forth that covered the sky were crushed, obliterated, and purified. Not to mention escape, they didn’t even have the room to struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that after the gold light spread out, it shocked Huai Ming and Bei Huang to the point of retreating repeatedly before executing techniques to defend themselves. This golden light contained the true essence of ‘universal purification,’ and it innately countered all evil. It even carried an extremely terrifying destructive force towards the glow of sin, causing them to have no choice but to take precautions against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Chen Xi clearly sensed a wisp of ‘Goldlight of Virtue’ effuse out within his Blackhole World, causing his Blackhole World to be even purer and firmer. It was even to the extent that it faintly carried a trace of the aura of natural virtue and peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi felt his Dao Heart become much more solid, and the imperceptible mysterious energy in his Dao Heart started to become clear. Even though it was still extremely weak, if it were to develop according to this momentum, then it probably wouldn’t be long before it would condense into an almost material ‘energy of the Dao Heart!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a force that came from the Dao Heart, and it was extremely mysterious. Even terrifying existences at the Heavenly Immortal Realm were rarely capable of grasping and cultivating it because this energy was too imperceptible and elusive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the elusive Dao of the Heavens, the ‘energy of the Dao Heart’ was similar an existence that was the most difficult to comprehend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never expected that I would even be able to condense the Goldlight of Virtue and solidify my Dao Heart after annihilating great sinners. Other spirit pills can’t compare with such a miraculous effect.” Chen Xi seemed to be lost in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the energy of sin that covered the sky had already vanished, whereas the gazes everyone within the estate shot at Chen Xi had already changed from their initial astonishment and shock to transform into deep reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the techniques executed by this young man were unbelievable and terrifying to the extreme, and they had no choice but to feel reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, do the both of you still have anything to say. Or perhaps, both of you want to wait for your backup?” Chen Xi raised his head abruptly with a gaze that was like lightning, and it locked coldly onto the distant Huai Ming and Bei Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, both of them had indeterminate expressions. Chen Xi’s strength caused them to feel extreme terror, and they were clearly aware that if they relied solely on their strengths, they might really not be a match for Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially when this kid was extremely ruthless, resolute, and utterly unafraid of all threats. They were slightly at a loss for what to do when facing a stubborn and overbearing figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a violet cloud suddenly drifted over from the distant horizon. If one looked carefully, the violet cloud was surprisingly condensed into form from numerous droplets of violet blood, and it emitted an extremely horrifying ghastly and bloody aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as this violet cloud appeared, this entire expanse of the heavens and the earth was filled with a ruthless, evil, and extremely icy cold aura that seemed like a cold and brutal devil had suddenly emerged from hell into the realm of the living.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Priest Zi Yun!” Wen Tianshuo’s expression suddenly went grim when he saw this, and his heart that was originally at east couldn’t help but rise to his throat once more. If Huai Ming and the others were great devils, then Priest Zi Yun was absolutely a king of devil, and he was extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the two old servants behind Baili Yan couldn’t help but frown when they saw this expanse of violet clouds, and they revealed a wisp of seriousness of their faces for the first time.</span></p>

This Priest Zi Yun was formed from a violet cloud in the depths of the ocean of sin that had attained the Dao, and he’d cultivated for no less than 10,000 years, causing his cultivation to be extremely deep. His character was gloomy and ruthless, and he’d even slaughtered a few tens of cities that had over a million citizens for the sake of refining a magic treasure. He was absolutely an overlord amongst evil cultivators and was infamous throughout the world.</span></p>
