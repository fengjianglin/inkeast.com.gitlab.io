 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man held his hands behind his back and had an indifferent gaze yet his entire body flowed with Immortal Energy, causing him to be like an abyss that gave others an unfathomable and horrifying feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, this was an Earthly Immortal Realm expert!</span></p>

These immortal sects, devil sects, and primordial clans surely possess their own respective Earthly Immortal Realm experts leading the group, and this white robed old man before me is probably an important person from the Heavenflow Dao Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi’s gaze glanced towards the old man, the latter’s gaze had similarly rose up to sweep towards him. The old man’s gaze was deep and icy cold, and it exploded out like a sharp sword that swiftly locked onto Chen Xi and it was sharp to the point it seemed capable of slashing his soul apart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shit!

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

In the next moment, he’d already shot out explosively towards the depths of the hall, and he was like a ray of light that moved at an unbelievable speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were numerous passageways that lead towards this hall, but at its deepest depths was a tightly shut bronze large door that was mottled with rust, and its surface was branded with some ancient and indistinct striations and patterns, causing it to seem ancient and as if it had experienced the tempering of countless years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he’d even arrived at this hall, the tiny cauldron had pointed out to Chen Xi that the core area of the Divine Palace of Creation was behind this door, and further back from there was the mysterious and unfathomable Door of Profundity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi had taken this door to be the path of his escape!</span></p>

The wisp of killing intent emitted inadvertently by the Earthly Immortal Realm expert allowed him to smell the smell of extreme danger, and if he didn’t leave now, then he would probably be unable to leave at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, it was an Earthly Immortal Realm expert!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The name Earthly Immortal already carried the word immortal within it. Even though it couldn’t be compared to a Heavenly Immortal, it was sufficient for an Earthly Immortal Realm expert to look down upon all the cultivators in the world. They possessed extraordinary strength and were the peak existences beneath the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When facing such a terrifying existence, how could Chen Xi dare have the slightest thought of being lucky?</span></p>

But the white robed old man had always been focused on Chen Xi, and he seemed to not be surprised when he saw Chen Xi fleeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, since you’ve come, then leave your life behind!” In the next moment, the white robed old man flicked his sleeve, and he suddenly struck out a bolt of lightning that glowed violet as it shot over explosively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu~ Wu~ Wu~</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shit!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, Chen Xi felt a horrifying coldness gush into his heart, and he practically instinctively withdrew all his strength and formed layer after layer of barrier around his body as he repeatedly executed boundless profound techniques to envelop the surroundings of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even then, he still wasn’t at ease, and he circulated his Blackhole World once more and caused it to rumble madly. Moreover, he gathered the Wings of Disruption behind his back and circulated it with all his might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt a piercing pain while everything in his surroundings were being annihilated as if they’d suffered a great calamity and the end of the world had arrived. His entire surroundings were covered in what seemed like chaotic purgatories as all his defensive Dao Arts were blasted apart layer after layer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, his body had suffered a heavy injury and was on the verge of shattering, and it was even to the extent that the violet colored lightning had invaded into his Blackhole World!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dark Parasol sapling, myriad of profundities, fuse into one, burn and repair!” At the critical moment, his Blackhole World suddenly emitted a wave of rumbling as the divine tree formed from the Dark Parasol sapling sprayed out a tide of Immortal Energy, and it instantly circulated a myriad of times to finally eliminate the violet lightning that had invaded his Blackhole World. But the meridians and internal organs within his body had already suffered a heavy injury and were devastated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the heavy injuries in his entire body, Chen Xi had a stronger feeling of astonishment. After that, a wisp of extreme danger surged once more into his heart, and he instinctively swished to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

At this moment, he was like a ferocious beast that had been forced into a hopeless situation. His eyes were completely red as he gritted his teeth and exerted all the strength in his body, causing the blood and vital essence in his entire body to seem as if they were burning madly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, he’d transformed into a ray of light that knocked open the door in the depths of the hall and finally charged into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

I’ll remember this! I’ll surely take your lowly life in the future!” The bronze door closed tightly once more and Chen Xi’s voice that was filled with boundless resentment and killing intent sounded out from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” The white robed old man grunted coldly yet didn’t pursue, and he stayed on the spot with a gloomy expression instead. He seemed to be slightly surprised that Chen Xi was able to avoid his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the others in the hall were stunned like clay figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this had occurred too quickly. From the moment Chen Xi fled to the white robed old man attacking, and to the point Chen Xi escaped while suffering a heavy injury. This string of movements occurred in an instant, and it was so fast that the others were unable to react to what had happened before Chen Xi’s figure had already vanished behind the bronze door!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This instant of combat could be described as occurring in an instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially because this combat had occurred between an Earthly Immortal Realm expert and a cultivator at the Nether Transformation Realm. Just thinking about such a scene caused the bodies of everyone to go cold and even their breathing became difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was actually able to dodge and successfully escape an assault from behind that came from an Earthly Immortal Realm expert!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone asked themselves that if they were in Chen Xi’s place, they would probably have been smashed into bits at this moment, whereas this was also the thing that shocked them the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, not to mention now, even if they looked back into the boundless annals of time of the entire Dark Reverie, a Nether Transformation Realm cultivator that could escape from the hands of an Earthly Immortal Realm expert was a rare existence like qilin horns and phoenix feathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They knew extremely clearly that if news of this incident were to be spread, it would surely cause Chen Xi to rise to fame!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Martial Uncle Chu Jing, your actions seem to be…” After a short moment, Leng Chan’er stared blankly into the distance as she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Slightly lacking in consideration of my status?” The white robed old man called Chu Jing smiled lightly yet his eyes were extremely icy cold. “This kid Chen Xi must be killed here this time! It isn’t just me, even if it’s the other elders of the sect that came here, they would act in the same way, and you ought to know the reason better than me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Chan’er was stunned as a wisp of bitterness arose in the corners of her mouth. She naturally knew that because of her Martial Ancestor Qing Xiuyi, the Heavenflow Dao Sect had already taken Chen Xi to be a needle in their eyes, a thorn in their flesh, and they wished for nothing more than to pluck out his tendons, pull out his bones, and burn his corpse before scattering his ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But never had she imagined that her senior would actually launch a surprise attack on a junior before the eyes of everyone, and this caused her to feel slightly uncomfortable in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As far as she was concerned, Chen Xi’s competition with Lord Bing Shitian was like throwing an egg against a rock, and Chen Xi was overestimating his ability.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they wanted to deal with him, they didn’t have to stop at nothing, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If news of this were to spread, it probably wouldn’t just draw the ridicule of the various powers, and it would cause a great storm if news of it were to enter the ears of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, that kid is already heavily injured. I’ll go kill him right away and seize the treasures back!” A disciple of the Heavenflow Dao Sect roared with laughter and was rather complacent, and he was excitedly intended to charge into the bronze door and pursue Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to pursue him.” Chu Jing suddenly spoke and instructed indifferently. “The other side of that door is filled with boundless danger. The Earthly Immortal Realm experts of the other powers have already entered earlier and are trapped within. That junior was heavily injured by my attack earlier, and he’s doomed once he went in there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the experts of the other powers lost their composure as their expressions turned grim.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Earthly Immortal Realm experts of the other powers? Isn’t that us?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they thought about how the Ancestors of their respective powers were trapped behind the bronze door while it was impossible to know if those Ancestors were still alive, all their hearts went cold.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly what sort of danger exists behind the door to the point that an Earthly Immortal Realm expert is actually unable to escape?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Besides that bronze door, this Divine Palace of Creation ought to have many mysteries left. Search carefully and it ought to not be difficult to obtain some fortuitous encounters.” Chu Jing swept the others in the hall with his gaze, and he grunted coldly before bringing Leng Chan’er and the others along as he turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an Earthly Immortal Realm expert, he would naturally not make a move against these juniors, because such actions would be too disregarding of his bearing. Not to mention all of these juniors had formidable backgrounds, and he didn’t dare kill them to silence them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for making a move against Chen Xi earlier… That was a special case and couldn’t be lumped together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go as well and search the other places.” Daoist Crimson Sun sighed and was slightly dispirited. He shook his head and brought the experts of the Truth Embrace Sect along as he turned and left as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Even the Ancestor is trapped within, and it’s only a path towards death if we go in. Worrying is useless!” Wen Daoran was silent for a long time before making a decision in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, these experts from the immortal sects, devil sects, and primordial clans had left successively, and not a single one of them dared to traverse through that bronze door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if an expanse of purgatory or a dead end was behind the bronze door, and death was certain!</span></p>
