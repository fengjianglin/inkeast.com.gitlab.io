 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Phoenixwind Divine Talisman! How could this be possible!?” Yin Biyun’s beautiful face turned pale because this Divine Talisman was the ultimate technique passed down by the ancestor of her Yin Clan, so how could she not recognize it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She struggled with all her might, but it was useless. It seemed as if she’d fallen into the eye of a tempest while a chilly hurricane whistled around here. These were the strong winds a strand of the Laws had interwoven together to form, and it was extremely terrifying and caused her to be unable to escape even if she grew wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

She didn’t utilize any external items, yet a flip of her white hand caused a myriad of profound talisman markings to spray out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These talisman markings that were dense to the point they were like a storm merged together to transform into the Azurewood Divine Talisman, or the Whitemetal Divine Talisman, and they were extraordinary, ingenious, and seemed like the embodiment of the Talisman Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did Chen Xi notice that the might of the Divine Talismans could actually be utilized in this way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he knew his own limitations, and he was extremely aware that it was extremely difficult to accomplish what his Senior Sister Li Yang was doing with his current cultivation. The reason was extremely simple, it was because the structure of every single Divine Talisman was too complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All those years ago in the world of stars, merely the inscribing of the talisman markings of the five great Divine Talismans onto the Talisman Armament consumed 25 years of his time, and that was only the inscribing of the talisman markings. Besides talisman markings, true Divine Talismans contained the aura of the Dao, accumulated the might of the world, connected with the gods of the world, and so on and so forth. (Please refer to Chapter 259 to read about Divine Talismans and its grades again.)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, it was obvious how complicated it was to truly grasp a Divine Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Chen Xi’s current cultivation in the Dao of Talismans, he was naturally capable of easily completing numerous steps of the creation of Divine Talismans. For example, allowing it to contain the aura of the Dao and accumulate the might of the world wasn’t difficult to him, but this was still unable to bring forth the true might of a Divine Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was that it wasn’t connected to the gods of the world. With his current cultivation, it was still very difficult for him to sense the existence of the gods, unless he attained a higher cultivation realm.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he was unable to execute various Divine Talismans that carried extraordinary might and could annihilate Mysterious Immortal Realm experts with a flip of his hand like Li Yang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though he was unable to execute them, it didn’t stop Chen Xi from observing. The battle between his Senior Sister Li Yang and Luo Zhanbei broadened his horizons and allowed him to benefit greatly. It was like a window had been pushed open before him, and he’d seen a different world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior Sister Li Yang is probably displaying all this for me. Otherwise, with her ability to crush Gu Jiuzhen earlier, how could Luo Zhenbei persist until now?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi seemed to be lost in thought, and he didn’t hesitate to abandon all distracting thoughts in his mind before observing with a calm heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was very well aware how precious the opportunity to observe a battle of such a level was, and it carried immeasurable benefits to his future path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, not everyone was lucky like him and had the chance to see Li Yang personally demonstrate the profundities of the Talisman Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most aggrieved person was Luo Zhenbei. As soon as the battle started, he noticed that the gap between him and Li Yang was truly too great, and he was completely led by the nose in the battle. He was like a worm that had fallen into the net of a spider, not to mention killing his opponent, even escaping was difficult!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that as he looked at Li Yang who had a relaxed bearing and seemed to be taking an idle stroll in a courtyard, Luo Zhenbei felt as if he was being played the monkey. He was jumping up and down, and he didn’t have the slightest elegant demeanor of a Mysterious Immortal Realm expert!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling caused him to be on the verge of spitting blood. But compared to this, the terror in his heart was even deeper. He’d already stopped thinking about whether he would be able to seize the cultivation technique from the 10</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level, and he was thinking about how to flee and survive instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because this opponent was too terrifying, and it caused him to be unable to estimate exactly how formidable the cultivation of his opponent was. She was formidable to the point that it caused his will to fight to crumble bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What should I do?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zhenbei was burning with anxiety. He glanced inadvertently, and he suddenly noticed that the black robed man was actually standing in the distance while watching coldly from the sidelines and had utterly no intention &nbsp;of lending a hand. At this moment, it instantly caused him to fume with rage, and he couldn’t help but roar. “Brother Mu! Aren’t you going to make a move? What are you waiting for!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This black robed man was called Mu Zheng, and he was an expert Luo Zhenbei had gotten to know by chance. They became friends at their first meeting, and coupled with his formidable strength, Luo Zhenbei had invited him to participate in the operation this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, Mu Zheng’s display was really not bad, and it caused him to appreciate it extremely. But now, Mu Zheng’s indifferent appearance caused him to be furious in his heart, and he felt as if he was betrayed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot. How could a Xeno-race like him possibly assist you with all his heart and might?” Li Yang sighed lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Xeno-race!?” At this moment, it wasn’t just Luo Zhenbei who was stunned, even the eyes of Yin Biyun, Liang Bing, Teng Lan, Chen Xi, and the other focused while they felt slight disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xeno-race was a method of address that the people of the three dimensions used for others from outside the three dimensions. As the saying goes, those that aren’t from my race surely possess sinister intentions. In reality, since the three dimensions had existed, the flames of battle with the Xeno-race had never stopped. Both sides had formed irreconcilable enmity, and it could only be resolved with blood and flames. There was no other way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this was the reason why everyone reacted in that way when they heard the black robed man was actually a Xeno-race expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black robed man continued to stand there without moving when his identity was exposed by Li Yang, and his eyes aura was gloomy while his face was covered beneath the black robe, causing him to seem extremely mysterious and composed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I’ve already told you what you should know, and you can die in peace.” Li Yang spoke with a light voice, and then her attack suddenly changed and became fierce and swift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! I can help you deal with the Xeno-race!” Luo Zhanbei roared loudly. At the moment of life and death, even an expert at the Mysterious Immortal Realm was no different than an ordinary person from the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you even worthy?” Li Yang replied indifferently with a question, and a single sentence of hers gave Luo Zhanbei the death sentence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, her clothed fluttered while she suddenly flashed past Luo Zhanbei like a wisp of chilly starlight, and she carried out a string of golden blood as she cut off a hideous head.</span></p>

Up until now, she was still unable to break free of the confinement of the Phoenixwind Divine Talisman. Coupled with witnessing Luo Zhenbei perish, the terror and horror in her heart was obviously intense to the extreme.</span></p>

However, she’d only spoken halfway when her entire body was directly minced into pieces by the Phoenixwind Divine Talisman, and not even any residue remained of her.</span></p>

But because of the appearance of a single young woman, the situation had instantly been turned around. Three Mysterious Immortal Realm experts had perished successively while the black robed man had become a Xeno-race expert instead. He was simply unable to accept such a scene!</span></p>

Her voice didn’t carry the slightest trace of a threat, causing it to seem like asking him to commit suicide was a supreme reward, and her peerless elegant demeanor caused Chen Xi to feel extreme admiration in his heart.</span></p>

If it was him, he would surely not waste his breath on Luo Zixuan and kill him with a single strike as well. But when Liang Bing and Teng Lan saw this, it caused both their hearts to shudder.</span></p>

But in Li Yang’s hands, they’d become people that were killed at will, and her attitude of casually taking her opponents as nothing caused both of them to feel deep fear.</span></p>

But never had she imagined that A’Li’s strength would actually be so formidable.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha! This show was brilliant indeed. Earlier, I was pondering how I should deal with them. Now, you did it for me and allowed me to watch all of you kill each other. It really did resolve a great deal of trouble for me.” The black robed man roared with laughter, and his voice was gloomy and hoarse. “As for my appearance, all of you can see it when you’ve died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his imposing aura changed. His body surged with jet black lights that seemed like roiling devilish qi, and his aura was actually more than two times stronger than before!</span></p>

Unfortunately, you’re only the cannon fodder of those Outerealm rebels. You don’t understand the Talisman Dimension yet dared to arbitrarily move about in the Talisman Dimension. Should I say that your courage deserves compliment, or that you’re benighted?”&nbsp;</span></p>
