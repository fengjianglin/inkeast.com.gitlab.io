 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fluctuation of battle was extremely violent. Everywhere it passed, mountains collapsed, trees shattered, and peerlessly violent chaotic flows of air crushed everything into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi originally intended to move around this battle, yet when his Immortal Senses reflected the appearances of the two parties, his eyes focused and flashed with a wisp of surprise. He instantly changed his decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, he’d charged over instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the parties to the battle was a grey clothed young man with an extremely ordinary appearance, yet his strength was extraordinarily formidable. He was that young man Chen Xi had seen in the restaurant within Jadewhale City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, this grey clothed young man was with Wang Ta, who was ranked at the second position on the Cloudrest Continent’s Continental Ascensio Rankings, and he seemed to be called Lie Binghan. His ranking was even higher than Wang Ta, and he was ranked at the top of the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Cloudrest Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was naturally not Lie Binghan that changed Chen Xi’s mind, and it was instead the two people that were pursuing Lie Binghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of them had an emaciated figure, a pale white countenance, and a pair of green and shiny eyes. The other had a robust figure, wore linen clothes, and he possessed a dignified and ferocious appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi acutely noticed an aura similar to Jiang Ning and Yue Zhen from these two people. It was the slaughterous, cold, and merciless aura, and their entire bearing was like that of a machine of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chen Xi wasn’t wrong, then they were definitely two Void Guards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the main reason that Chen Xi had changed his mind.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the depths of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard! You actually dared to injure our companion. How audacious of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Ding, why waste your breath? Don’t forget Senior Brother Lu Chen’s orders. No matter who it is, kill all who dare try to cross Cloudlight Bridge by force!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Qiu Yan is right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst a wave of icy cold conversation, the emaciated young man called Zhao Ding and the young man in linen clothes called Qiu Yan pursued Lie Binghan without letting up, and they seemed as if they desired to annihilate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan gasped for breath with a pale countenance while blood flowed from his shoulder and the area beneath his ribs. Obviously, he’d suffered heavy injuries from this pursuit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed as if he hadn’t heard the conversation between the two enemies behind him at all. He flew as he dealt with their attacks, and his pale countenance was filled with tenacity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lie Binghan’s heart wasn’t as calm as he seemed on the surface.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Exactly where did these freaks come from? To think that I’m currently ranked in the top five hundred of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings, yet I’m actually not a match for any one of them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, I misjudged Wang Ta this time. I never expected that he would actually disregard his dignity and kneel down to swear to the enemies. Even though he obtained a chance to pass through the Cloudlight Bridge, yet his actions are too despicable and shameless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I, Lie Binghan, would rather die standing, and I absolutely wouldn’t bend down like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nevermind, what’s the point in thinking so much? If I’m able to survive this time, I’ll definitely slaughter that bastard in the future!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a terrifying force surged over like the tide. It shook Lie Binghan to the point he flew over 3km into the distance while coughing up blood, and his vital energy faintly revealed trace of disorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Lie Binghan could start fleeing once more, Zhao Ding and Qiu Yan had transformed into rays of light, and they completely blocked off Lie Binghan’s paths of retreat from both the front and back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan’s heart sank when he saw this, and he gritted his teeth and puckered his mouth while remaining silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go on! Flee! Why aren’t you fleeing?” Zhao Ding sneered as he moved forward, and he stared at Lie Binghan as if he was staring at a corpse. His gaze was filled with silent ridicule and contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! The number one expert on Cloudrest Continent’s Continental Ascensio Rankings? Unyielding character? In our eyes, you’re no different than dog shit!” Qiu Yan walked forward with large strides before suddenly stretching out his arm and makings a clawing motion. It transformed into a swift pitch black gale that clawed fiercely at Lie Binghan’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This strike was extremely ruthless and resolute, and it didn’t give Lie Binghan any chance to catch his breath. Obviously, Qiu Yan intended to end the battle quickly so as to avoid getting into any further trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the way the Void Guard did this. They were born for slaughter, and they didn’t show any mercy when facing their enemies, let alone hesitate or delay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he sensed how terrifying the might of this claw was, Lie Binghan’s heart sank. He knew that he was utterly incapable of avoiding this strike with his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be that I’m going to perish today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Lie Binghan thought of many things. There were the arduous experiences he had on the path of cultivation, the yearning and longing he had to enter Dao Emperor Academy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, all of this transformed into dense unwillingness. He suddenly raised his head while a wisp of resolution appeared in his eyes. He’d decided that even if he died, he would drag one of them down with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before Lie Binghan could take any action, a strand of a strange sword howl resounded. It was like a rumbling tide, yet seemed like a lingering drizzle chirping by his ears…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What sound is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, sword qi that was vast like an ocean slashed down, and it seemed to have transformed this expanse of the heavens and the earth into a surging ocean!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What terrifying water element sword qi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Zhao Ding and Qiu Yan’s eyes focused while their expressions turned slightly pale, and they instinctively dodged to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But to their horror, that wisp of sword that hadn’t descended yet suddenly transformed into ten, then ten transformed into a hundred, a hundred transformed into a thousand… In the end, it transformed into boundless fine strands of sword qi that fluttered in the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single strand of sword qi was filled with the Laws of Water, and it was like threads of rain that were sharp, slaughterous, and easily cut space apart inch by inch as if it was a piece of cloth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The veil of sword qi that covered the sky made it seem like it was the rainy season. It enveloped the heavens and the earth, enveloped Zhao Ding and Qiu Yan, and it was suffused with a dangerous aura. It caused both of them to be unable to help but feel a chill run down their spines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the stimulation of this lethal danger, both of them practically instinctively roared with fury and exerted all their strengths to execute their strongest attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Qing gestured with a raise of his hand to withdraw thirty six thick chains that seemed like lava, and they soared into the air like flaming dragons and whistled out in an unrestrained and violent manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu Yan held an iron hammer that was over 3m long, and it was like he was swinging a myriad of mountains. It carried the imposing aura capable of crushing everything in the world, and it smashed fiercely towards the veil of rain swords that assaulted them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both their attacks contained terrifying energies of the Laws, and the might of their attacks caused the nearby Lie Binghan to be horrified and feel almost suffocated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very well aware that if these two people utilized such attacks against him earlier, then he would have probably perished a long time ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But to Lie Binghan’s horror and shock, Zhao Ding and Qiu Yan’s full forced strikes were actually like pieces of paper beneath the myriad of strands of fine sword qi that covered the sky and rained down. Their attacks were torn apart and shattered inch by inch, and it emanated a wave of explosions that shook the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed to be all powerful like splitting through bamboo and sweeping away dry leaves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What sort of sword qi is this!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Ding and Qiu Yan’s pupils dilated and were filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu! Pu! Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the reply they got was the rain of sword qi that descended without mercy. It was light like a drizzle yet was filled with an extremely sharp and murderous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, both their figures stiffened as countless strands of fine bloody marks stretched across their bodies like a spiderweb, and then two bangs resounded as their bodies suddenly exploded. They exploded into numerous thumb sized pieces of flesh while a rain of blood sprayed towards the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mist of blood was still drifting through the sky, yet the sword qi that were like a misty drizzle had vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When facing such a shocking scene, Lie Binghan’s hands and feet were icy cold while he stood there flabbergasted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What sort of sword technique is this? How terrifying…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that a tall figure drifted down, and it was precisely Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t even spare a glance to the corpses that had been transformed into pieces. He stretched his hand and grabbed the thirty six chains and iron hammer before putting them away, and that he glanced at Lie Binghan before taking action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thump! Thump! Thump!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous apricot yellow Formation Flags flew through the sky, and they were fixed within an area of 50km according to Chen Xi’s intention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw such a scene, Lie Binghan recovered completely from his shock, and he took a few deep breaths before he said seriously while cupping his hands, “I’m Lie Binghan, thank you, Fellow Daoist, for this life saving grace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan was able to discern that Chen Xi was only at the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, yet Chen Xi was obviously not an ordinary figure since he was able to kill Zhao Ding and Qiu Yan in such an easy manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for that. Saving you was only something that happened while killing them.” Chen Xi didn’t even turn around, and he placed the apricot yellow Formation Flags in various different positions while deducing the various fine details of the Devil Vanquish Grand Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan was stunned when he saw this, and he couldn’t help but warn Chen Xi. “Fellow Daoist, they are many in number, and there’s no lack of existences that are even more formidable than the two from before. If you don’t leave now, then they’ll probably come over immediately upon noticing the death of their companions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That would be for the best.” Chen Xi answered casually with a calm expression, and he seemed as if he was speaking about an extremely ordinary thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan was stunned once more. Only now did he notice that Chen Xi seemed to be setting up a formation, and he couldn’t help but speak with surprise. “Fellow Daoist, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’m very busy right now. Speak about any questions you have later. Now, I advise you that it’s best you make the best use of your time to recover your strength.” Chen Xi frowned and seemed to be impatient, and he directly interrupted the question of this number one expert on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Cloudrest Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan’s expression froze, and he was slightly embarrassed. If it was a normal time, no one would dare speak like him in this way with his identity and status in Cloudrest Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it wasn’t the same at this moment. He was very well aware that this unknown young man seemed to possess a cultivation that was two stages lower than him, yet this young man actually possessed an extremely formidable combat strength and couldn’t be taken lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I originally thought those damnable fellows were abnormal enough, yet never had I expected a fellow that’s even more abnormal than them would appear now…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan shook his head as he laughed bitterly and sat cross-legged on the ground, and he started to regulate his breathing and recover his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scenes he witnessed toward impacted him greatly. It caused him to suddenly notice that perhaps he could be ranked at the first on the Continental Ascensio Rankings in Cloudrest Continent and reign supreme above all, yet if it was in the entire Immortal Dimension, all of this couldn’t be the capital for him to be proud any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, this handsome young man before him or the enemies he encountered earlier, all of them possessed cultivations at the Mysterious Immortal Realm, yet their combat strength was extremely abnormal. If they were to participate in the competition on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Cloudrest Continent, then Lie Binghan didn’t doubt that he would be unable to maintain his ranking of number one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten minutes later, Chen Xi suddenly raised his head while his eyes narrowed slightly as he said, “Come, they’ve arrived!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lie Binghan instantly returned to his senses and emanated his Immortal Sense to search the surroundings, yet he didn’t notice anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused him to be shocked once more because he clearly realized that even if it was in terms of the strength of his soul, he wasn’t a match for this young man before him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, Chen Xi and Lie Binghan’s figures vanished on the spot.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
