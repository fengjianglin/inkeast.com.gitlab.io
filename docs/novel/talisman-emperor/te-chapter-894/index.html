Up until this point, those two sentences still reverberated by his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was ‘yield to me.’</span></p>

Moreover, she kept repeating the same thing…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most infuriating thing was that Mortis seemed to be extremely cooperative, but this cooperation was reflected in his refusal.</span></p>

So Mortis finally shut up when the last portion of energy in his body had been completely exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, A’xiu was like a victorious general. She was complacent and high in spirits, and she put Mortis away with a raise of her hand, causing him to transform into a palm sized, icy cold, and murderous little combat puppet that wore black armor and a black helmet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to what A’xiu said, this was Mortis’ true form, and it was exactly similar to the little combat puppet that had the Emperor of Control’s Scripture recorded within it. But he was extremely unlike any other ordinary Soul Combat Puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Mortis seemed to be of an even higher grade and much more intelligent. Chen Xi didn’t know what spirit materials Mortis was constructed from, but merely from Mortis’ outward appearance, it was utterly impossible to discern that the little combat puppet was a Soul Combat Puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, after experiencing the passage of countless years, Mortis’ strength was extremely weak, yet he was still capable of exerting a strength comparable to the 6</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level of the Earthly Immortal Realm. Moreover, he was resolute in slaughter and fearless, causing him to seem like a machine born for slaughter.</span></p>

But compared to all of this, Chen Xi was even more concerned with the situation in the entire Dark Reverie now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xeno-race had repeatedly made appearances in the Dark Reverie, and they’d obviously found a method to escape the detection of the Heaven Dao, allowing them to fearlessly invade cities like locusts, causing numerous cities and powers to fall into the bloody flames of war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If such a situation were to continue, then it would be like a single spark that lit a prairie ablaze, and it would spread throughout the entire Dark Reverie. At that time, this vast land that was the closest to the Immortal Dimension and where a myriad of living beings resided in would be unable to avoid being swept into a storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, blood, slaughter, and death would become the main theme of the Dark Reverie, and no one could avoid it. They could either fight or die, whereas the most innocent at that time would probably be those ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Chen Xi stepped onto the path of cultivation until now, he’d never thought that he would possess the feeling of wanting to save the world, nor had he ever felt pity for all the living beings in the world. But when facing a situation where undercurrents were brewing and a storm was approaching, his heart still felt heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention it was impossible for him to turn the situation around and save everyone in the world from this calamity with his ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps the only thing he could do was to rely on his own strength to protect the people by his side from this chaos that was coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a sign of the upheaval of the three dimensions. The heavens hadn’t emanated killing intent yet, but the Mortal Dimension was already in chaos…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could imagine that since the Dark Reverie was like this, the other large worlds and even the Immortal Dimension and Netherworld were probably repeatedly suffering calamities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When facing an upheaval like this that affected the three dimensions, the strength of a single person was indeed too weak. Perhaps it was just like the tiny cauldron had said, under the upheaval, gods were like grass, immortals and devils were like ants, and no one could remain unharmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack! Crack!</span></p>

He turned around to look and his originally heavy mood instantly became terrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mortis, who’d already transformed into a fist sized little combat puppet, was holding onto an Immortal Artifact and chewing on it. Even if he was eating, his figure was extremely straight, tall, murderous, and icy cold like a little freak without any emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A’xiu sat cross-legged on the ground while her hands held up her beautiful little face, and she grinned as she looked at Mortis with a brilliant gaze as if she was happy from raising a little pet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Ling Bai, Bai Kui, and A’Man were extremely shocked instead. They looked at Mortis with dumbstruck expressions, and they seemed to not dare believe that there was an existence that was even more capable in eating than them. Moreover, his taste was so strange…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this wasn’t important to Chen Xi, the most important thing was that A’xiu had asked for this Immortal Artifact from him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was merely an extremely ordinary Immortal Artifact, it was still a rare and precious treasure to an expert at the Earthly Immortal Realm. But now it had become food to feed Mortis…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Chen Xi’s mood be good when he saw such a scene?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Ling Bai suddenly sat upright and crossed his arms before his chest, and then he said with a cold and proud expression, “I’ve eaten magic treasures in the past, so there’s nothing great about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Kui nodded fiercely as well, and he seemed to be saying that he’d eaten magic treasures in the past as well.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Bai hesitated for a moment, and then he recovered his proud expression as he said, “It’s terrible, and it wears down your teeth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Kui hurriedly nodded when he heard this, and he was like a little follower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A’Man didn’t believe them and pointed at Mortis as he said, “It seems very tasty from how he’s eating it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Err… Maybe the taste of Immortal Artifacts is really good?” Ling Bai thought for a moment and suggested. “Why don’t we try eating an Immortal Artifact? I haven’t had one in the past as well.”</span></p>

He was absolutely unable to tolerate this sort of behavior of wasting things like taking Immortal Artifacts as food!</span></p>

But when she heard that even the ‘Puppet of Mortis’ Soul’ had been lost, her gorgeous face was instantly livid as she roared with a low voice.</span></p>
