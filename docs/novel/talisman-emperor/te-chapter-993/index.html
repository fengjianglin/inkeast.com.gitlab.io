Not only did they contain the profundities related to ‘rebirth,’ they were even a pair of supreme weapons of slaughter.</span></p>

Moreover, even the Myriad Flow Godcage Formation had fallen into silence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took a long time to describe, yet this string of events actually occurred in an extremely short period of time.</span></p>

The appearance of the Netherworld Register and Condemn Evil Brush had indeed exceeded their expectations, but the pressing matter at hand was to kill Chen Xi and the Nether Spring Grand Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As old figures that had cultivated for countless years and supreme figures in the Netherworld, it was impossible for King Chu Jiang and the others to fall into disorder because of this.</span></p>

As he spoke, he probed Chen Xi with an attack. A Daoist book that was crimson red like blood flipped open in his hand, and an expanse of blood red radiance surged out from within it. Dense mist rose from it while it was suffused with the Laws of a Golden Immortal, and it smashed down at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the attack of a Golden Immortal, and it was capable of shaking the sun and moon and obliterating the nine heavens!</span></p>

So once it wasn’t restrained, it would surely cause an entire large world to fall into disorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw this, Chen Xi just flicked his sleeve and didn’t even utilize the Condemn Evil Brush, yet the bloody glow collapsed and shattered inch by inch.</span></p>

He was even more formidable than King Chu Jiang. Yet now, the treasure in his possession was actually seized away with a single strike!</span></p>

All those years ago, I passed down this treasure to the First King of Hell, and every single King Qin Guang would possess this treasure, assume command over the Mirrored Table of Sin, and attend to the judgment of spirits. Yet now, it has been utilized by you to go against me…” An aged and low voice suddenly escaped Chen Xi’s lips, and it carried a wisp of sorrow and seemed to be recalling the past. “Unfortunately, a valuable pearl has been thrown into darkness, and it has been tarnished in the end. There’s no need for it anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a precious treasure had actually been shattered easily at this moment, and it transformed into dust.

The Third Netherworld Emperor was crushed by the gods and Buddhas of the world a long time ago. How could he possibly have survived until now? Who exactly are you?” King Chu Jiang took a deep breath and spoke with a grim voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s exhausted a great deal of effort to plan this trap and had awaited the time to haul in the net with great difficulty, yet this scene threw his plans into disorder.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he held the Condemn Evil Brush and casually flicked it in midair, causing a wisp of sharp light to flash.</span></p>

It was filled with unfathomable profundities, and its lethality was terrifying to the limit. It shocked King Chu Jiang and the others to the point they were unable to recover from their shock before the treasures in their hands were completely destroyed!</span></p>

This caused their expressions to become extremely unsightly, and they were filled with terror, frustration, and were slightly perplexed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being stared at by this gaze caused the bodies of King Chu Jiang and the others to stiffen while their souls palpitated with fear. They felt extreme terror that was simply no different than the fear they felt when facing an Immortal King.</span></p>

At that time, the entire Netherworld will fall into an upheaval and war. Could it be that you wish to watch such a scene occur?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;At this moment, he didn’t seem like someone who was capable of devising strategies and giving out commands. He’d already been terrified by these unexpected events to the point his mind was shaken, so he didn’t have any other thoughts but the thought to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Netherworld is already decaying. Perhaps only war will be able to rebuild the order of the Netherworld. So all of you have to die.” Chen Xi’s voice had already become utterly emotionless, and its calmness revealed a force that controlled life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of everyone turned pale, and only the Nether Spring Grand Emperor revealed an expression of deep contemplation.</span></p>

Absolutely impossible!” A wisp of resolution suddenly flashed past the face of King Tai Shan, and his figure flashed as he tore space apart with the intention of fleeing.</span></p>

Moreover, terrifying fluctuations even surged out from within it and collided fiercely with King Tai Shan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>

King Tai Shan seemed as if he was an insect that was grabbed by a shapeless hand, and he was completely covered in blood. Every single inch of his skin and flesh was collapsing, and his face had warped while he emitted waves of miserable and shrill cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The sin has been planted. You’re like an ant in the boundless Sea of Misery that’s without a shore, so where can you escape?” Accompanying this aged and calm voice was a bang, and then King Tai Shan actually transformed into a ball of blood that rained down from the sky. He’s actually been crushed to death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the beginning until the end, he didn’t even have any room to struggle.</span></p>

A wisp of terror that couldn’t be concealed or restrained extended into their hearts, and then it was reflected on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because they were very clearly aware that this was actual death, and there was no possibility of being reincarnated or reborn. From this moment onward, the current King Tai Shan, Cai Shentu, had been eternally obliterated from the world!</span></p>
