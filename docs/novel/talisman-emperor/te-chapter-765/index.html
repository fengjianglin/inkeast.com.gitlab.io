For a time, the experts and disciples of the various great sects rushed towards Skyreach Sect in unison because even though they were unable to participate in it, they would be able to watch and learn from it, and it was sufficient for them to obtain boundless benefits from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, during these past three years, the disciples of the Unknown Lands and Secluded Paradises had been emerging into the world successively, and they’d made great reputations for themselves. They seemed to have become existences that were like the scorching sun in the midday sky, and their reputation even overshadowed the disciples of the 10 great immortal sects.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the disciples of two great mysterious sects would supposedly attend the grand meeting and might even participate in it to compete with the disciples of the 10 great immortal sects.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a total of eight disciples participating from the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, and they were respectively Chen Langya, Luo Qianrong, Chang Le, Ning Zhen, Long Zhenbei, Wang Zhonghuan, An Wei, and Yun Ye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These eight people could be said to be the greatest existences amongst the Core Seed Disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, and the weakest amongst them possessed six times combat strength! Moreover, most of them possessed extraordinary natural talent and strengths that far exceeded ordinary people.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A great senior that lived in seclusion within the Nine Radiance Sword Sect had once given a very objective and fair evaluation of Chen Xi. He said Chen Xi stood towering within the world, stood proudly above the geniuses, and led the tide of an era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a figure had actually not come to participate in the grand meeting, so it caused countless people in the world to be extremely disappointed. Some said he was trying to act better than others, some said he didn’t deserve his reputation…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even more people vaguely guessed that it wasn’t that Chen Xi didn’t want to participate in the grand meeting, but it didn’t arouse his interest in the slightest.</span></p>

It was like the heavens and the earth were being split apart once more and creation emerged into the world, and it caused a star to be sliced apart into two meteors that whistled as it plunged to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the world of stars, and the myriad of stars here were no different from real stars that stretched out from countless of kilometers, yet this single sword qi had sliced it into two!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How vast and sharp was this sword qi?</span></p>

It was thick like a chopstick, 3cm long, crystalline, translucent, and suffused with the brilliance of creation. Moreover, an ancient talisman marking converged on its surface to transform into the pattern of an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike Chen Xi’s Exalted Rank cultivation at the Nether Transformation Realm, this was left behind by the Exalted Ant Emperor of the primeval times that possessed enormous strength, and whose might was on par with the Dark Parasol Divine Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until now, Chen Xi still remembered how lofty and proud the extremely tiny little ant who held the broken sword was when it slaughtered the Xeno-race Saint Emperor within the Door of Profundity. It was like a god of the sword that had come from the primeval times, like an existence that held the world and creation within its body, and it caused him to be unable to help but feel boundless reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Creation…Such a miraculous and terrifying Grand Dao profundity actually exists in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi muttered, and then he took a deep breath and started to meditate in comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this piece of jade white bone was only 3cm in size, it was branded with extremely vast and numerous profundities, causing it to seem as if boundless secrets were contained within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword technique contained within it was called ‘the Sword of Creation!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Chen Xi’s surprise, even though he was able to comprehend the profundities of the technique, he wasn’t even able to sense the Creation Dao Insight contained within the technique, let alone comprehend it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was like a situation where he was only able to comprehend the sword technique yet unable to study its essence, and it was as if he had an empty shell that lacked an aura and force to transform the simple into the extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned because this was the first time he’d encountered such a difficult Sword Insight since he’d advanced into the Nether Transformation Realm, and even his extraordinarily high comprehension ability and the River Diagram fragments seem to have encountered an obstruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the more it was like this, the more it allowed him to sense how extraordinary the ‘Sword of Creation’ was. In other words, a cultivation technique like this surely possessed a might that shook the heavens and the earth, so even though it was exceedingly obscure, if he was able to master it, then its might would surely exceed his imagination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi pondered briefly before thinking no more and continuing in his comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was temporarily unable to touch the Creation Dao Insight, he wanted to comprehend the profundities branded on the bone because it might be of great benefit towards his efforts to comprehend what ‘Creation’ was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, 10 months had passed fleetingly, whereas a month had passed in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wait! This ‘Sword of Creation’ doesn’t adhere to any fixed moves. So, only figuring out its form yet being clueless towards its insights is an utterly futile effort…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, Chen Xi opened his eyes and couldn’t help but sigh. He’d exhausted 10 months of time, yet still had no progress, and he couldn’t help but feel a wave of depression because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Creation, exactly what is creation?</span></p>

Some people said that creation is a type of fortune, so people frequently said that they would give fortune to another, fortune plays tricks on people, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people said that creation was a part of nature. It was without a shape like the Dao, ethereal, and impossible to comprehend, so it was a part of nature and formed the beauties of nature.</span></p>

This time, he didn’t continue comprehending the profundities within it but just silently looked at and reflected on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart was calm like a lake without ripples.</span></p>

Its footsteps were very slow, yet extremely firm, and it revealed unquestionable tenacity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It climbed up a blade of grass, yet when it looked up, it noticed the tree was taller than the blade of grass. So it climbed up the tree. But when it arrived at the crown of the tree, it noticed that there were actually mountains…</span></p>

Along the way, it suffered the bluster of wind and rain, the assaults of armadillos, and it almost suffered the burning of a wild fire once.</span></p>

Finally, a day came when it hadn’t climbed up the peak of the mountain, yet its vitality had already started to deteriorate. It started to weaken and started to feel that it lacked the strength to carry out its will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain couldn’t be compared to the tree. It was extremely tall, and it was tall to the point of seeming to be out of reach to a tiny ant. But it still moved forward silently while disregarding life and death, facing the hardships of the journey, without fear of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it climbed up to the peak of the mountain, it noticed to its shock that there was actually a place higher than the mountain. It was the boundless sky, the place it was able to see from anywhere!</span></p>

It just raised its head to look towards the sky with a gaze that was so unwilling and so silent, and then it was swept away by a gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too tiny, so it was blown into the sky. Instantly, it saw the landscape of the earth, saw the stellar bodies, saw the myriad of living beings that were muddling through their lives on the ground…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The numerous scenes that changed constantly and all the strange and unusual things it saw was like a thunderclap that caused its soul to feel terror and palpitate, and then it suddenly roared furiously. “Dao! Dao! Dao!”</span></p>

It shattered the layer of clouds as it resounded out in the sky, and the ant struggled free of the restraint of the wind and leaped out of its own shackles.</span></p>

It shook the surroundings and spread throughout the world while a wisp of light surged out from its exhausted body that was covered in scars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ant held this strand of light and split the sky apart, and then it was still unsatisfied and slashed down a star!</span></p>

So what if I’m an ant? Creation coexists with the world and everything in the world is part of the Dao, so how could there be a difference in status? How could there be a shackle of height?”</span></p>

Even though it was lowly, it was persistent! Even though it was tiny, it was fearless!</span></p>
