 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this wanton and indiscriminate blasting, the rocks in the surroundings of the gorge shattered into pieces, causing enormous pieces of rubble to fly about while dust and smoke charged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi dodged ceaselessly, and his figure moved about indeterminately amidst these attacks while his gaze had already become icy cold to the extreme. He’d used great efforts to try and subdue this jade ornament, yet never had he imagined that Taishu Huarong’s group would charge in and completely destroy his efforts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This jade ornament was really extraordinary and possessed shocking intelligence. It floated indeterminately while shrouded by auspicious qi and glowing brightly, and he’d exerted all his ability, yet found it impossible to approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, he could only use force against force, and he’d utilized his entire cultivation to emit a myriad of thunderstorm vortexes to try and lock onto the jade ornament before slowly subduing it. However, he’d just obtained a tiny bit of results when Taishu Huarong’s group of three had charged in and instantly alarmed this extraordinary treasure, causing his plans to be completely disrupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taishu Huarong stood upright in midair. Even though he wore coarse linen clothes, he possessed a shockingly mighty aura, and his eyes seemed to have a myriad of swords surging within it while emitting a piercingly cold bright light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, even though you’ve already cultivated the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture to perfection, you’re far from being a match for me. Give up that treasure and leave now, and I’ll let you live.” These were the first words Taishu Huarong spoke since seeing Chen Xi, and his voice was calm and heavy while revealed an extremely strong confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had seen many outstanding genius experts, yet there were none like Taishu Huarong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Taishu Huarong stood there, he seemed to constantly emanate the feeling of daring to do anything and the unrestrained feeling as if he could do anything, and it felt as if he knew no bounds. It seemed as if he firmly believed he was capable of defeating the heavens, the earth, and everything in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi was slightly disgusted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you talking to me? I heard you’re called the Sword Crazy Kid, I think you should be called the Idiotic Kid!” Chen Xi’s eyes were icy cold to the extreme and killing intent had already risen completely within his heart. Being continuously pursued, ambushed, and having surprise attacks launched at him during the past few days had caused him to have a belly full of rage long ago. At this moment, when he saw that not only had Taishu Huarong disrupted his plans, Taishu Huarong still dared to act so arrogantly, the rage in his heart was instantly and entirely aroused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No one has ever dared to call me an idiot! You’re courting death!” Taishu Huarong’s voice was indifferent as he took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strike was angular like a serpent and filled with sharpness, and it seemed like a rising sun. Merely its aura could command the skies and move the sun and moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spirit Control Sword!” The eyes of Taishu Huarong’s companions lit up as they’d recognized the sword technique Taishu Huarong executed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword technique was comprehended by Taishu Huarong from the heavens, the earth, and everything in nature, and this sword move linked up with the heavens and the earth to command everything in the world. It was like a strong gale when it swept out ferociously, and when it was gentle, one could even rub it with one’s finger. Yin and Yang were fused together, causing it to contain both softness and ferocity, and it contained numerous Grand Dao Insights. It was precisely by relying on this sword technique that Taishu Huarong had obtained the nickname of Sword Crazy Kid in the Snowray Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi held up the Talisman Armament and swept it horizontally through the sky as he executed the eight great sword moves of the Myriad Convergence Sword Technique to receive Taishu Huarong’s strike head on. The two swords collided in midair, and in an instant, they’d already crossed swords over a thousand times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taishu Huarong’s hair fluttered as his sword pointed up towards the sky while he stood in midair, and he seemed to have become the one and only king in the heavens and the earth, a sword that commanded everything in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Chen Xi’s clothes fluttered as the Talisman Armament was coiled with countless arcs of lightning that shook the space in his surroundings. At this moment, he was like an emperor that controlled lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, very good. Chen Xi, you were actually capable of withstanding my Sword Insight. It truly causes me to be excited.” Taishu Huarong’s eyes burned, and he deserved the nickname of Sword Crazy Kid as the aura emanated from his body became stronger. “I only exerted half my strength earlier, and you being able to withstand it is sufficient to prove that your cultivation in the Sword Dao isn’t bad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Obviously.” Chen Xi suddenly put away the Talisman Armament and said with disdain, “I didn’t even utilize half my strength earlier. Truthfully speaking, you’re very disappointing. Sword Crazy Kid? You don’t even have the qualifications to make me take out my sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t have the qualifications?” Chen Xi’s words directly caused Taishu Huarong to become upset. As the Sword Crazy Kid, his sword technique was the best in the younger generation of the Snowray Dynasty, yet it was the first time he’d heard someone dare to say this, and this was simply the greatest offense towards the Sword Dao that he’d always been pursuing!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I spared your life yet you actually dare provoke me instead? I’ll take your blood and soul to atone for your crimes today!” His gaze of piercingly cold to the extreme and surged with dense killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A powerful sword light pierced out and actually developed into a vast world that directly crushed down. This sword strike wasn’t sharp, yet was powerful and immense, and it seemed as it the entire heavens and the earth was within this sword strike and was crushing down along with it. It gave others an insurmountable and terrifying pressure, as if one was going against the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi executed the Starsky Wings and charged up as his fists struck out like raindrops. Every single fist contained countless thunderstorm vortexes that blasted out, and the scene created was like countless lightning millstones were rumbling, revolving, and smashing down. It directly and utterly shattered the might of this sword strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You took the heavens and the earth as your master? It’s nothing great. Receive a punch of mine as well!” Chen Xi’s counterattacked with his fist and directly arrived before Taishu Huarong. A punch blasted out like a myriad of lightning striking down from the heavens as vortexes covered the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! My sword is the heavens and the earth, and the heavens and the earth are me! How can you understand such profundity? Heavens and earth be my sword, transform into a cage, die!” Even though he was speaking, Taishu Huarong’s hand didn’t stop in the slightest. The sword in his palm flew about around him while piercing into space. Every single time it pierced out, a sword net would appear, and they covered the entire sky densely before enveloping down and obstructing Chen Xi’s footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His sword technique was calm and unhurried, and his expression seemed as if he was taking an idle stroll in the courtyard while looking at the scenery. But his sword move became more and more fierce as the sword strikes transformed into a cage that contained both the ability of entrapment and slaughter within it, and every single attack it released pierced directly towards Chen Xi’s heart or head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single sword strike was capable of confining the ages, locking down light and darkness, and enveloping the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This move was one of Taishu Huarong’s strongest killer moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Us cultivators seek the ability to leave the three dimensions and transcend the five elements, to wander all corners of the universe and obtain great freedom. How can this be something that a tiny cage is able to trap?” Chen Xi utilized the Starsky Wings to the limit, causing a myriad of stars to circulate on it, and it carried him to move in between the sword lights and move about between the sword nets. The sharp sword lights and sword nets were entirely incapable of injuring him as his body seemed to have transformed into an unreal shadow that couldn’t be tainted by anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The sun and moon floated while worlds alternated within the vertical eye, and it contained the truth behind all the changes in the universe.</span></p>

His six arms overlapped in pairs, causing him to seem as if he was embracing the world, and a rumbling thunderstorm vortex that was dazzling like the sun and contains surging arcs of lightning was condensed. When looked at from afar, it was like an enormous black hole had been torn open in midair.</span></p>

Even Taishu Huarong’s hair started flying up as the clothes he wore fluttered with the wind, and he seemed as if he was about to be swallowed into the vortex.</span></p>

The imposing aura emitted from his entire body rose explosively with a bang, and it actually became stronger by more than a few times in an instant!</span></p>

Chen Xi’s strength is extraordinary indeed. There’s probably rarely anyone in the same generation that’s capable of being a match for him. Unfortunately, there’s an entire realm of difference between him and Senior Brother Taishu, so he’s bound to lose.”</span></p>

His sword swept through the sky and transformed into golden lights that were like 10 scorching suns. “Spirit Control Sword, crushing the world with 10 suns!”</span></p>

The mountains, earth, ruins, and rubble, everything was enveloped by the flames, and they were incinerated into nothingness.</span></p>

No! How can this be possible? How can a disciple from an ordinary Dynasty like you possesses such a precious treasure? The heavens are unfair!” Taishu Huarong’s extremely terrified howl sounded out from within the sea of flames. His entire body was enveloped by the flames, causing him to transform into a flaming man, and he’d already suffered from a heavy injury and was struggling with the intention of fleeing.</span></p>

He repeatedly fanned the flaming fan in his hand once more, causing the glow of flames to gush out with a bang and transform an area of 5,000km around him into a sea of flames.</span></p>

If I’m reborn, I’ll surely burn your bones and scatter your ashes so that you’ll never be able to be reborn.” Taishu Huarong was instantly unable to flee, and his shrill cries slowly and gradually became softer and weaker before completely vanishing. He’d perished, completely incinerated into nothingness, and not even a corpse of bones remained.</span></p>

However, right at this moment, a terrifying fluctuation suddenly arose nearby, and it caused the heavens and the earth to tremble violently!</span></p>
