They let out shrill and miserable cries as their bodies dried up, burned, and swiftly transformed into ash.

Within their fields of vision, the Grand Dao Fragment actually transformed into a flowing ray of light and flew off as if it possessed intelligence!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone tried to stop it, yet had his body penetrated through and died miserably on the spot.</span></p>

Every single piece was priceless, and they were practically impossible to find outside the Dark Parasol’s Abyss. On the other hand, that fellow had actually obtained five in a short amount of time, and this fact was absolutely capable of making everyone go crazy!</span></p>

No matter if there was enmity between them in the past, all these experts that came from all over had joined forces tightly together and formed a front for the sake of capturing a single person. Even if the seniors of the sects behind them were to see this scene, they would probably not dare believe all of this was real.</span></p>

All of them had their eyes wide open and didn’t let any place escape their inspected, and this caused Chen Xi to instantly feel boundless pressure and laugh bitterly without end.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had he imagined that just taking away a few Grand Dao Fragments would cause such a great commotion that caused him to not dare make a move rashly and could only hide in a hidden cave within the Region of Earth while lying low.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he didn’t stay idle and seized this time to start meditating and tempering his Blackhole World.</span></p>

The Blackhole World within his body had expanded repeatedly, and the True Essence it contained was an entire five times more than before!</span></p>

It was formed from a strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul, and it possessed a special attractive force to those Grand Dao Fragments, causing them to be unable to refuse him. It was because of this that he was able to obtain those Grand Dao Fragments so easily.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the Dark Parasol sapling was from the tiny cauldron!</span></p>
