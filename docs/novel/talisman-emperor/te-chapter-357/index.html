 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This moved of Chen Xi’s was very ordinary, yet it was a move that gave Xiao Xuantian a taste of his own medicine, and Chen Xi being able to easily achieve this while in battle was shocking. After all, Xiao Xuantian had attacked suddenly earlier, whereas Chen Xi was fighting Xiao Xuantian head on, so the superior party could be determined instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xuantian was at the center of it all, and what he felt was completely different from the others. Chen Xi looked to be an indifferent and aloof person, yet when he suddenly made a move, the strength he revealed caused Xu Xuantian to be shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially when he faced this grab of Chen Xi, he felt as if raging storm that rumbled with thunder and flashed with lightning surrounded him, and a simple grab seemed to contain numerous Dao Insights that locked down the heavens and the earth and overturned the workings of the heavens, causing him to actually have the feeling of being unable to resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xuantian wasn’t in time to dodge. A wisp of dazzling gold light suddenly suffused around his entire body as talisman markings flowed about within it, and then it condensed into an armor that protected his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, this was a top-grade earth-rank armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes flashed as he opened his hand into a palm, and then he slapped down with a strength that had increased a few times higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brilliant light and fluctuations spread out explosively in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xuantian staggered back a few steps and was shocked once more in his heart. The armor he wore was extremely valuable and was refined by a great equipment refiner. It was covered with an entire 81 layers of talisman formations and was capable of negating 70% of the strength of enemies that possessed the same cultivation as the user, causing its defensive ability to be rather shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even though more than half of the strength of Chen Xi’s strike was negated, the remaining strength still shook him to the point his vital energy and blood roiled and the aura on his entire body almost collapsed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly how terrifying is the strength of this palm? If I didn’t have this armor to defend myself, I’m afraid my shoulder bone would have been shattered instantly, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he didn’t have the time to think about it while in battle. Xiao Xuantian strode a step forward as flames flowed all around his body, causing him to be like a god that bathed in flames, then one of his palms gestured to hold up the heavens while the other touched the ground, and they overlapped each other before forming a myriad of palm prints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The heavens and the earth impermanent, flames are ruthless, melt the heavens and the earth, blaze the universe!” At this moment, Xiao Xuantian’s hair fluttered as a wave of surging flames swept out with a raise of his hand, and then the myriad of palm prints were like a myriad of flame dragons that roared in the sky and charged at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow still refuses to give up hope…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed in his heart. Earlier, if he utilized the Talisman Armament, then a single strike would be sufficient to shatter the armor on Xiao Xuantian and chop him into two. Unfortunately, Xiao Xuantian seemed to not appreciate his kindness and continued pestering him while being impervious to reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regretfully, this was only a spar and not a true life and death battle, so the victor couldn’t be decided with life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there was no time for Chen Xi to think any further, and he form a sword with his fingers right away before a tempest surged while water and fire swept out waves around him. The Dao Insights of lightning, wind, fire, and water sprayed out, causing his True Essence to sometimes seem like surging flames yet sometimes seem like an endlessly flowing river, and all of this condensed onto his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi similarly took the initiative to launch an attack, and he charged forward like a bolt of lightning, causing numerous afterimages to appear before he became locked in battle with Xiao Xuantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Core Disciple that was put emphasis on in fostering in the Xiao Clan, the strength he’d concealed was extremely outstanding as well. But when compared with Chen Xi, he was greatly inferior instead, and there were many times that Chen Xi had shown mercy and not taken his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Xiao Xuantian didn’t appreciate his kindness and still continued persisting in his actions without the slightest graceful bearing he had from before. This caused Chen Xi to frown without end, and he didn’t continue exercising restraint any longer, causing his moves to become fierce and swift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he couldn’t kill on the spot, he could cause some injury to his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the two of them had already exchanged no less than a few hundred blows. Their figures crossed each other with speeds that were swift as lightning, and at the instant everyone was bedazzled by the scene before them, their figures separated right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was calm, collected, and without the slightest injury, whereas Xiao Xuantian’s hair was disheveled, his clothes torn apart, and numerous striking bloodstains could be faintly seen on his exposed skin, causing him to seem to be in an extremely sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this was because Chen Xi had shown mercy. Otherwise, if Chen Xi slightly increased his strength, those bloodstains would become heavy injuries that Xiao Xuantian would be unable to heal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned by this scene, and they seemed to have been completely flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they’d vaguely guessed before that Chen Xi’s strength was extremely formidable, when they saw the Xiao Clan’s peerless genius, Xiao Xuantian, falling to such a miserable state at Chen Xi’s hands, it caused their scalps to go numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it turns out that this pussy pretty boy is really so formidable…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Yan Yan finally knew of Chen Xi’s strength, and the shock in her heart couldn’t be expressed with words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhenfeng was extremely shocked in his heart as well. He possessed a roughly equal strength to Xiao Xuantian, and it was the type of equal that caused them to be completely on par. What caused him to be shocked was Chen Xi was capable of easily defeating Xiao Xuantian, so wouldn’t that mean that Chen Xi was also capable of easily defeating him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was slightly unable to accept this truth. As the Junior Marquis of the Thunder Marquis Estate, he’d received the most excellent inheritance since a young age, nor did he lack wealth, companions, techniques, or locations. Moreover, everything he possessed were top-rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He originally thought that by relying on his strength, it would be sufficient for him to cut a striking figure and become eminent in the Allstar Meeting. However, Chen Xi’s appearance instantly caused him to realize that he might have underestimated the geniuses of the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not convinced, continue!” Suddenly, a shrill and loud shout of rage resounded out and shook the hall, and it jolted awake everyone who was still in a state of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xuantian who was covered in bloodstains and had disheveled hair struck out again without regard for anything, and he emitted a violent aura. Obviously, he’d already aroused killing intent and wasn’t only sparring as he said earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Enough!” Before Chen Xi could make a move, Wang Zhenfeng had shouted out explosively and flashed over to block before Xiao Xuantian first, and then he berated with a grim voice. “It’s only a spar. A loss is a loss. Could it be that you’re adamant on dying on the spot?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even you think I’m not a match for him?” Xiao Xuantian laughed miserably, and it seemed as if losing to Chen Xi caused the pride in his heart to suffer an extremely great blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t help but shake his head when he saw this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person looked to be lighthearted and possessing a graceful bearing. But in truth, he’s fairly narrow-minded and sensitive, and he’s unable to accept defeat. He’s bound to not go far in the path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, you can stand down.” Wang Zhenfeng spoke in an indisputable tone. The shortcomings Xiao Xuantian revealed at this moment caused him to frown endlessly. But, as a friend, he couldn’t bear to say anything further, and he only hoped that Xiao Xuantian could recover after having a rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t stay any longer. The successive events during this banquet caused him to be rather disgusted, so it was better for him to leave this place of troubles as soon as possible.</span></p>

The banquet he held this time could be said to have achieved nothing. He originally intended to suppress Chen Xi, yet now it would seem like it was obviously impossible to achieve. So it was meaningless to continue persuading Chen Xi to stay.</span></p>

They seemed like a host of stars that surrounded a bright moon, and it caused everyone in the hall to let out a wave of sighs.</span></p>

She sat upright at the side, and the imposing aura she emitted was actually not the slightest bit inferior to the other two people.</span></p>
