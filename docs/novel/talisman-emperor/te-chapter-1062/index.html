 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

All the experts here were astounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He actually wants to challenge Yin Miaomiao?</span></p>

Who was Yin Miaomiao? There was no need for any explanation, she was absolutely one of the peak experts on the Continental Ascensio Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the young man before them was only at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm!</span></p>

It was filled with absurdity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, everyone exploded with laughter, and they took it to be a horrible joke that couldn’t be taken seriously. All of them felt that for the sake of saving face, Chen Xi dared to fearlessly speak nonsense because he was clearly aware that it was impossible for Yin Miaomiao to make a move against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, Yin Miaomiao was slightly stunned when she heard these words, and then she looked at Chen Xi with a serious expression as well. Her cherry lips parted slightly as she spoke two words. “You’re unworthy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was just these two simple words, yet it carried a strength that completely convinced everyone that was present here today. She didn’t give any explanation, nor did she have to give any explanation because these words were spoken by her, Yin Miaomiao, and that was enough to prove that Chen Xi was indeed unworthy to challenge her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an open refusal that came from Yin Miaomiao’s confidence towards her strength, and it was similarly a direct denial of Chen Xi’s strength.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He just glanced at Yin Miaomiao’s disappearing figure and spoke a single sentence. “You won’t have any qualification to challenge me in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned. It sounded arrogant when they heard it first, and as they dwelled on it, it was simply matchlessly arrogant.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You won’t have any qualification to challenge me in the future? Doesn’t that mean that Yin Miaomiao’s rankings in the future will be left far behind him, and it would be just like how Yin Miaomiao treated his challenge?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s truly too arrogant!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt that even though this young man’s combat strength far exceeded his peers, yet his arrogance far exceeded his peers as well because he actually dared to say that Yin Miaomiao wouldn’t have the qualifications to challenge him in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Jiang Zhuliu that’s ranked at the first wouldn’t dare boast like this, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she heard these words, Yin Miaomiao who was walking towards the distance froze briefly before she shook her head and took Chen Xi’s words spoken in anger with the intention of impressing others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, she recovered her calm and vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In her opinion, the provocation and words spoken in rage by an ant were insignificant. If she were to make a fuss about it, then it would be indirectly elevating this ant’s status instead, and it was completely unnecessary and a waste of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like she’d said earlier, he wasn’t worthy, so how could her feelings possibly be affected?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her gaze was always looking ahead, and she was staring at the Ascensio Immortal Rankings since the beginning, so she naturally wouldn’t care about a challenge issued by an ant that was far behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha! Yin Miaomiao really didn’t agree. I knew it would be like this.” A green robed young man with white skin and narrow and long brows that stretched to his temples stood in the extreme distance. He looked from afar towards the direction Yin Miaomiao disappeared and couldn’t help but chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think that young man is very laughable?” Another thin and tall young man with slanted brows and starry eyes that wore a loose and white scholar's robe stood by the green robed young man’s side, and he couldn’t help but frown when he heard the green robed young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The green robed young man was stunned, and then he asked. “What? Cousin Brother Yueming, could it be that he isn’t?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yutang, all those years ago, did you dare to issue a challenge to a top expert just like he did?” Gu Yueming kept his hands behind his back as he replied slowly with a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yueming!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only a single person named Yueming on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Southbridge Continent, and it was the eldest son of the Gu Clan that was renowned for the Dao of Talismans, Gu Yueming, who was ranked at the second!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, there was only a single person named Yutang, and it was Gu Yutang who was ranked ninth. He was from the Gu Clan as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s naturally impossible for me to have issued such a challenge because would I be any different from an idiot if I issued a challenge that I’m clearly aware I don’t have the slightest chance to win?” Gu Yutang spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You didn’t even issue the challenge, so how could you possible know you don’t have any chance? Honestly, as far as I’m concerned, that young man really doesn’t have any chance against Yin Miaomiao, yet he dared to challenge her, and this is a form of courage. It’s really too much better than those fellows that only know how to mock and ridicule.” Gu Yueming expression became serious as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Courage? It looks to me like he’s courting death. If it was in the outside world, an idiot like him would have died a long time ago. How could she possibly listen to him running his mouth?” Gu Yutang was even more unwilling to accept this when he saw Gu Yueming seemed to be preaching seriously, and he couldn’t refrain himself from sneering and ridiculing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yueming sighed lightly. He looked at the young man in the distance that had already walked down the arena, and he said slowly, “Don’t forget that this is the Martial Emperor Domain. Why were there rules here? Why was there no worry of perishing here? Have you thought of the reason behind this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yutang was stunned because he really hadn’t considered this sort of questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A true expert naturally has to realize the situation he’s in, yet you haven’t even considered the situation you’re in, so what qualifications do you have to look down on him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not to mention that he doesn’t just not deserve to be ridiculed, he’s worthy of respect and being valued highly.” Gu Yueming’s expression carried a wisp of praise at this admiration at this moment. “In the entire Immortal Dimension, how many people are capable of defeating an initial-stage Mysterious Immortal Realm expert while at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm? Does anyone have the qualifications to ridicule and disregard a young man like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yutang was speechless. His attention had been drawn over by the conversation between Chen Xi and Yin Miaomiao, and he subconsciously felt extreme aversion towards an arrogant young man like this. However, he’d overlooked that just moments ago, the young man had created a miracle that was sufficient to make the entire world exclaim with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, this miracle had even broken the record that Yin Miaomiao had created all those years ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, the disdain Gu Yutang felt towards Chen Xi was wiped clean, and his expression became serious as well while he nodded and said, “He really is a figure that has to be valued highly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Gu Yueming couldn’t help but grin when he saw this and said, “Yin Miaomiao’s refusal came from an expert’s absolute confidence, and it isn’t wrong in itself. Similarly, no one has the qualifications to ridicule the challenge that young man issued.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, his brows furrowed as he looked towards the distance and muttered. “I suddenly have a feeling that this young man’s appearance will surely cause great waves that draws the attention of all. Perhaps it’ll turn around the entire situation on the Continental Ascensio Rankings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yutang was shocked in his heart. If these words were spoken by another, then perhaps he would just laugh it off. But when these words were spoken by Gu Yueming who was ranked second on the Continental Ascensio Rankings, then he had no choice but to take it seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he still felt it was slightly difficult to believe and stared blankly as he said, “He’s only at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm. We would have probably advanced to the ranks of Golden Immortals by the time he advances into the Mysterious Immortal Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yueming answered with a question. “Why must he wait until he advances into the Mysterious Immortal Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yutang was stunned, and then he quickly came to sudden realization and said with shock, “Right, he’s already able to defeat initial-stage Mysterious Immortal Realm experts now. If he advances into the intermediate-stage, advanced-stage, or even perfection-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm, then he would probably erupt with an even more formidable combat strength. He really can’t be judged based on convention.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he’d completely placed Chen Xi in an important position in his heart, and he didn’t dare regard Chen Xi as insignificant any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s still too early to determine all of this. I heard that Liang Ren is cultivating with the intention of challenging me, whereas Yin Miaomiao is similarly cultivating with all her strength with the intention of being ranked in the top three. I can’t fall behind either…” Gu Yueming smiled in a carefree manner, and it was as if he was speaking about something that wasn’t related to him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cousin Brother Yueming, are you intending to challenge Jiang Zhuliu?” Gu Yutang was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiang Zhuliu…?” Gu Yueming’s expression gradually became slightly serious when this name was mentioned, and he pondered deeply for a long time before he shook his head and said, “I’m not confident in being able to defeat him. No, it’s impossible for me to be a match for him in the next ten years. Perhaps only those existences in the top thousand of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings can compete with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he finished speaking, he couldn’t refrain himself from sighing with emotion. “A fellow of poor birth actually reigned superior above the experts of our four great clans that’re renowned in the Dao of Talismans, and he occupied the first ranking for a few tens of years. This isn’t something that just anyone can accomplish…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that his rankings have already advanced into the top thousand of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings, and he’ll be joining the Dao Emperor Academy next year. At that time, he’ll probably become a sweet bun that all the top powers of the four great continents compete to obtain.” As he spoke, Gu Yutang’s face couldn’t help but reveal a wisp of envy, shock, and admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Zhuliu really was an extraordinary and shocking figure. He came from poor background and didn’t belong to any sect. However, he was able to be ranked at the first rank of the Continental Ascensio Rankings in Southbridge Continent, and no one was able to shake his position for a few tens of years. This was a miracle by itself, and this miracle was still continuing until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As things were now, there was still no one capable of shaking his status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Gu Yutang had a thought in his heart and couldn’t help but ask. “Cousin Brother Yueming, do you think that kid from before has the ability to challenge Jiang Zhuliu? Of course, I’m not talking about now, but the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yueming shrugged and laughed lightheartedly. “I don’t know either. Everything will be proved in time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, he pondered deeply for a moment and said, “Go investigate the dispute between him and Yin Feng’er. If it’s possible, it’s best if you can obtain detailed information about him. A young man like this is worthy of our continued attention.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yutang nodded immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi was being stared by countless strange gazes from the surroundings as he moved towards the distance. But his expression was extremely calm, and he seemed as if he didn’t notice everything that was occurring in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Yin Miaomiao’s opinion, he was a figure that wasn’t worthy of any attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Chen Xi’s opinion, Yin Miaomiao wasn’t worthy of his attention either. His time constraints didn’t allow him to be immersed in the scenes from before, not did he have the time to sigh with emotion or feel depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He intended to head to the fifth level of the arenas and participate in the battles of experts at the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d come here for the sake of tempering himself. Thus, he naturally had to choose an opponent that was on par with him so that he could properly temper his strength. It was best if he could determine exactly what ranking on the Continental Ascensio Rankings he could obtain when he went all out with his current strength.</span></p>
