 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man that arrogantly ridiculed Chen Xi lay prone on the ground now while grimacing in pain and spasming endlessly. Shockingly, the handsome young man stood before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this scene, how could they be unable to discern that the person who threw their companion down was this young man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me where this is and I’ll spare you this time.” Chen Xi lowered his gaze to look at the young man on the ground and asked with an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” The young man opened his mouth and was just about to curse furiously. But when he encountered Chen Xi’s eyes, he couldn’t help but shudder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pair of eyes were indifferent and calm yet filled with an aura that had disregarded life and death. It seemed like so long as someone dared to go against him, that person would suffer the wrath of the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the young man completely understood that this fellow before him wasn’t an idiot that didn’t know anything, but a true expert, and a person that killed without batting an eyelid!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because only by experiencing the baptism of innumerable blood and battles would one be able to possess such a gaze, and an ordinary person was utterly incapable of copying it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, the gaze the young man shot at Chen Xi carried a wisp of dense terror, and he didn’t dare hesitate and said in a respectful tone, “Young Hero, this place is the Region of Metal in the Dark Parasol Secret Realm. According to my inference, there ought to be a Grand Dao Fragment branded with the profundities of metal hidden here, and we’ve come precisely for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All his companions were astounded when they saw him be so cooperative, and their faces were covered in disbelief. Never had they imagined that after the young man suffered such humiliation, not only did he not flare up, he would actually be so obedient and simply be like an obedient child that was exceptionally meek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dark Parasol Secret Realm, Region of Metal…” Chen Xi’s eyes lit up instead as he never imagined that he would actually accidentally arrive here directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did all of you encounter anyone from the Nine Radiance Sword Sect when you came over?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Radiance Sword Sect?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter if it was the young man that still lay on the ground or the others that remained on the back of the flying beast, all of their expressions revealed great shock and realization when they heard this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it turns out that he’s a disciple from one of the 10 great immortal sects, the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, no wonder, no wonder!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, the gazes they shot at Chen Xi couldn’t help but carry a trace of reverence because ignoring the formidableness of Chen Xi’s cultivation, merely this identity made him someone they couldn’t afford to offend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Hero, we didn’t encounter any great disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect all the way here.” The young man took a deep breath before he spoke, and his expression was even more respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chen Xi was slightly disappointed, and he asked a few more questions before letting the young man go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But through these questions, he found out that killing intent was hidden all over this Region of Metal, and it was extremely dangerous. Only by flying in the sky would he be a bit safer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because if one walked on the ground, one would encounter the assault of a type of terrifying tempest of metal. This tempest was extremely strange and came out suddenly from the ground. Once one was swept by it, one would absolutely die without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man’s group had once seen numerous cultivators being swept away by the tempest of metal due to their carelessness. Not to mention corpses, even scraps weren’t left behind, and it was exceedingly horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to what that young man said, all the living beings that have entered the Region of Metal have come for the sake of the Grand Dao Fragment. Perhaps I’ll be able to inquire about the whereabouts of Senior Sister An and Long Zhenbei after I arrive there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi pondered briefly, and then he didn’t stay here any longer and soared up to transform into a flowing ray of light that flashed towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;…</span></p>

All of them were left behind by the Dark Parasol Divine Tree from the primeval times before it perished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to rumor, these Grand Dao Fragments were formed from the Laws of the Heaven Dao, and every single Grand Dao Fragment contained a different Grand Dao profundity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a cultivator was able to obtain one, then so long as it was refined, the cultivator would be able to grasp a Grand Dao profundity to the Perfection Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was different from a Dao Insight Origin Pill. A Dao Insight Origin Pill was refined by gathering numerous natural treasures of the heavens and the earth and extracting the Blood Essence of a Heavenly Immortal. Even if one consumed it, one would only be able to comprehend a type of Grand Dao profundity and learn the basics of it. If one wanted to completely grasp the Grand Dao, then one had to cultivate and accumulate comprehension over a long period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Grand Dao Fragments only had to be completely refined before one could attain the Perfection Realm in the Grand Dao contained within the fragment. So it’s value was so great that it was absolutely not something a Dao Insight Origin Pill could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Grand Dao Fragment that was branded with the Grand Dao of Metal was hidden within this Region of Metal.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, there were many more regions like this within the Dark Parasol Secret Realm, and it drew the experts of the various powers over to explore them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi flew for around the time for an incense stick to burn before he finally saw numerous rays of light tearing through the sky in the extreme distance while rushing even further away. There was no lack of beings from the clans of the Primordial Era amongst them, and it seemed to be extremely clamorous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he was finally about to approach his destination, and it was very likely that a Grand Dao Fragment branded with the Grand Dao of Metal was hidden there. Merely thinking of it caused him to be extremely moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If I’m able to obtain it, then coupled with my strength, I’ll be entirely capable of exerting double my combat strength. At that time, what would I be afraid of even if I fought the other experts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he flew forward for another 50km, the smell of blood actually started to be emanated from the path ahead. Besides that, there were also some magic treasure fragments, severed limbs, and mangled corpses, and they showed that he’d entered into a dangerous area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Chen Xi became cautious upon arriving here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, an enormous lake appeared within his field of vision. Golden lake water surged about within the lake, and it was brilliant and clear as it tainted the entire heavens and earth gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most horrifying of it all was the golden colored lake actually emanated an extremely terrifying sharp aura that threw the heavens and the earth into disorder and emitted the hissing sounds of tearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one approached slightly, one’s skin would hurt as if it was being sliced by blades, and it pierced the eyes to the point it was almost impossible to keep them open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were many figures standing in the surroundings of the golden lake. All of them were on alert and had made sufficient preparations because it seemed as if the golden lake contained a shocking treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve wandered around this region for a long time, and only the aura of metal here is oppressive. That Grand Dao Fragment is surely hidden here!” Someone spoke with certainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! It isn’t only you who has discerned this. Who amongst the people present hasn’t? But we’ll have to depend on our own strengths if we want to obtain the Grand Dao Fragment, otherwise, perhaps some accident might occur.” Someone spoke gloomily.</span></p>

If we continue waiting, then the people that come over will only increase.” Someone frowned and was filled with anxiety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s so difficult about that? Wouldn’t we know if we find someone to go in the lake and try?” The person that spoke was a young man with a handsome appearance and an arrogant expression, and there was actually a lone horn that was suffused with a crimson glow of flames growing out from his smooth forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young man swept the surroundings with his gaze and just happened to see Chen Xi who’d just arrived here, and he instantly set his mind at rest when he saw Chen Xi was all alone. So he pointed at Chen Xi right away. “You, get into the lake and check it out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was able to discern that this young man ought to be a being from the Flameox Clan, and he could be considered to be of noble birth.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi disregarded the young man and shot his gaze towards the golden lake instead. He was able to sense that this lake was filled with an extremely dense aura of the Grand Dao of Metal, and it was extremely shocking and simply on the verge of turning material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being directly disregarded by Chen Xi before so many people caused the face of the young man from the Flameox Clan to sink instantly, and his eyes surged with the glow of flames as he roared explosively. “Bastard, did you not hear me!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why must you be so impetuous?” Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh as he noticed he was really unfortunate because it seemed that no matter where he went, there seemed to be someone that would wish for nothing more than to trample upon him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that it’s because I keep a profile that’s too low?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you mean by that?” The young man frowned, and his imposing aura grew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing, I just want you to get into the lake and check it out.” Chen Xi spoke calmly and naturally as he gave the young man a taste of his own medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You’re courting death! Fucking get into the pool obediently!” The young man was furious. He flashed out before slapping out with his palm, and he intended to force Chen Xi forward to scout out the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle was obviously impossible to avoid.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Chen Xi’s surprise, this young man’s strength wasn’t bad, and it was absolutely not something an ordinary person could deal with. Every single move of the young man erupted with surging waves of flames that were peerlessly overbearing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, it was an exceedingly formidable Dao Art, and it ought to be the Innate Dao Art of the Flameox Clan.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was bound to lose when encountering a freak like Chen Xi who possessed shocking potential. The battle didn’t last for ten moves before the young man was slapped flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the surroundings was exceedingly shocked in their hearts when they saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go, enter the lake and check it out. It’s your fortune if you’re able to live, and if you suffer a disaster, then you can only blame yourself for being unfortunate.” Chen Xi raised his hand and tossed the young man from the Flameox Clan over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually dare to treat me like this? My Eldest Senior Brother will absolutely crush you!!” The young man felt a mix of terror and fury, and he cried out repeatedly. His arrogance from before had transformed into terror because he never imagined that when he casually grabbed a scapegoat earlier, he would actually bite off more than he could chew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned and seemed to have recalled the Flameox Clan had a formidable expert that he saw before he entered the sea of clouds, and this expert had led his clansmen to be the first batch that charged into the sea of clouds.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he shook his head and was completely unconcerned. This young man was only a disciple of the Flameox Clan, and such threats were utterly incapable of being too much for him. If it was in terms of status, then he was a Seed Disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, and it wasn’t something that a power like the Flameox Clan could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man flew in midair. With his strength, he was actually completely capable of turning halfway and avoiding the lake. However, what caught him off guard was that as soon as he arrived in the sky above the lake, a golden vortex charged up and directly swept him into the lake, and it shocked him to the point of crying out loudly before vanishing instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My god! Could it be that there’s a ferocious beast beneath the lake?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It… actually instantly swallowed an expert from the Flameox Clan, it’s simply even more terrifying than the tempests of metal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the people in the surroundings of the lake saw this sudden and bloody scene, all of them couldn’t help but gasp and cried out involuntarily with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

It seemed as if something shocking was about to emerge, and the commotion it made was extremely great to the point that even the voices of everyone were completely covered by it.</span></p>
