 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The treasured cauldron erupted with divine light that illuminated the hall while the shapeless energy of divinity swept out towards the surroundings while emanating a desolate, ancient, and deep aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had the faint feeling as if this treasured cauldron before them that had existed since the primeval times seemed as if it was about to awaken from its deep slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, their confidence towards Chen Xi’s method of restoration grew once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, they were skeptical towards Chen Xi’s method of restoration and retained a strand of doubt in their hearts. Yet now, the doubt in their hearts had lightened greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, they weren’t even able to recognize the damaged talisman formation diagram, let alone cause such a phenomenon to occur. This obviously showed that Chen Xi’s method of restoration was working for now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene caused all of them to be even more serious and solemn. Even if they were unable to figure out the secrets contained within the talisman formation diagrams that Chen Xi conveyed to them, not a single one of them dared be careless as they acted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was completely unaware of all of this. Even though he wasn’t physically taking part in the process of restoration, yet his entire mind was converged onto the cauldron because he still had to command these seniors before him, so he didn’t have the slightest time to think about anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wasn’t wrong, then the quality of the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron had exceeded the Void Grade since a long time ago and coupled with the talisman formation diagrams related to Karmic Luck that were branded onto it, it was extremely difficult to completely restore the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, it was utterly impossible to be completed by Chen Xi alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Chen Xi didn’t have to act on his own. Practically all the seniors present here were existences at the Half-step Immortal King Realm while the others were either supreme grandmasters in the Dao of Talismans or the Dao of Pills. So the possibility of success would undoubtedly be even greater with them acting on his behalf to restore the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with the passage of time, the trembling of the cauldron grew louder and louder. It was deep like the drum of the gods yet was also like the shouts of the ancient people of the primeval time, and it was desolate, ancient, and aroused reverence in the hearts of all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If commoners were to hear this sound, then they would surely think the heavens had sent down a decree, and they would definitely kneel down and kowtow without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Later on, the sound emanated by the cauldron even spread out of the hall and throughout the Pill Reserve. The mountains, rivers, boundless sky, vast ground, and everything else reverberated with this ancient rumbling of the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like the tune of the heavens, the chanting of the Grand Dao, and it caused the heavens and the earth to be bathed in a divine atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the instructors and students who were in class within the Pill Reserve had stopped everything they were doing, and they revealed shocked expressions while their hearts felt as if it had been cleansed. They were immersed within this feeling and were unable to free themselves from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once all of this has ended, do as I said and bring that sword back.” At the same time, a voice that seemed to be indifferent, yet was actually grand; and seemed to be warm and flat yet was actually dignified and supreme sounded out from within an unknown and mysterious space in the depths of the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could this be possible!?” Zuoqiu Sheng’s eyes opened wide while his chubby face couldn’t help but reveal a wisp of astonishment. Moreover, the corners of his mouth couldn’t be restrained from twitching fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The restoration of the cauldron hadn’t ended, so he shouldn’t be astounded to such an extent. But when he saw the divine radiance emanated by the cauldron and head the rumbling of the cauldron that grew grander by the moment, he was unable to maintain his calm any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because all of this seemed to be moving towards the direction of success, and it didn’t show the slightest sign of failure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s a problem that perplexed all the instructors of the Pill Reserve. How could a little bastard at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm like him possibly accomplish it? Could it be that an expert guided him from behind the scenes?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Sheng’s expression changed indeterminately while the gaze he shot at Chen Xi’s figure bluntly revealed a wisp of detest, maliciousness, and resentment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This won’t do. I absolutely can’t watch as this occurs!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Sheng gritted his teeth and seemed to have made an extremely difficult decision, causing his expression to faintly become slightly savage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, he’d stood up and taken a deep breath before he actually squeezed out a wisp of a grin on his face and strode towards Chen Xi as he said, “Fellow Daoists, I’ll lend all of you a hand as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he intended to move forward and approach them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a hand appeared out of thin air and landed onto his shoulder. It seemed to be a gentle and slow action, yet it actually caused Zuoqiu Sheng’s entire body to stiffen while his countenance turned pale. No matter how he tried, he was actually unable to move in the slightest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Instructor Zuoqiu, it’s sufficient for you to observe calmly from the side.” An icy cold and aloof voice resounded by his ears, yet it was like a bone piercing cold wind that caused Zuoqiu Sheng’s fat figure to suddenly shudder. He didn’t need to turn around to know that the owner of this voice was Hua Jiankong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, it’s Fellow Daoist Jiankong. May I know the reason for your arrival?” Zuoqiu Sheng forcefully squeezed out a smile before he turned around and spoke. Sure enough, he saw Hua Jiankong who wore grey clothes and had snow white hair was standing by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, he actually didn’t notice when Hua Jiankong had appeared within the hall or when Hua Jiankong had arrived by his side!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve come under the orders of my Master.” Hua Jiankong answered indifferently before falling silent, and then he placed his gaze towards the distant cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Zuoqiu Sheng was completely stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He came under the orders of his master… Doesn’t this mean that the Dean noticed everything that occurred here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then exactly what order did Hua Jiankong receive? Is it to punish Xuanyuan Pojun? Or does he have another objective?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Sheng’s thoughts instantly fell into chaos. He was able to faintly sense that all his guesses were probably wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps Hua Jiankong’s appearance is related to Chen Xi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An inexplicable wave of agitation arose in his heart when he thought up to here. He was clearly aware as well that when the new student’s recruitment test ended, it was precisely Hua Jiankong who’d appeared out of thin air and stopped all the seniors of the academy from fighting to take Chen Xi as their personal disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet now, Hua Jiankong had just happened to appear once more when Chen Xi was restoring the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron, so wasn’t this too much of a coincidence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Exactly what’s is going on?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more he thought about it, the more bewildered he was, and Zuoqiu Sheng’s head started aching slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a fluctuation that shook the heavens and the earth rumbled through the sky, and it shook the nine heavens and struck the nether springs. It shook Zuoqiu Sheng to the point his heart trembled fiercely while the vital blood within his entire body roiled, and he suddenly awoke from his wild thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It actually…really worked….”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected this, I truly never expected this! We’re vainly addressed as supreme talisman formation grandmasters, yet we actually can’t even compare to a student. The young really are fearsome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of exclamations of shock rose and fell as they entered into Zuoqiu Sheng’s ears. He raised his eyes to look and saw all the others had surrounded the cauldron while viewing it. Moreover, the shock, admiration, and excitement on their faces was impossible to conceal. It was as if they were admiring a peerless precious treasure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Li Bei and the other Enforcers revealed a wisp of a gratified expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He actually…he actually really succeeded!” Zuoqiu Sheng felt dizzy, and he was slightly unable to accept this scene before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He originally intended to rely on this to strike a blow upon Xuanyuan Pojun, and to this end, he didn’t hesitate to invite Enforcers over at great cost, yet how could he have imagined that such a scene would occur?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! Not bad! Not bad! Not bad at all!!” Xuanyuan Pojun roared with laughter and was extremely delighted. Every time he said the words not bad, he would swing his palm and pat Chen Xi on the shoulder, and it hurt to the point the latter gnashed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the palm of an existence at the Half-step Immortal King Realm, so even if he didn’t put any force into it, it was still powerful to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Others like Xuanyuan Tong and the supreme talisman formation grandmasters of the Xuanyuan Clan looked at Chen Xi with gazes that carried a wisp of heartfelt admiration and emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alas, if I knew you had such ability, I would have risked going against the decree of the Dean to take you as my personal disciple. A pity, truly a pity.” The Pill Reserve’s Dean, Chen Haotian, sighed repeated as he looked at Chen Xi, and he seemed to be filled with regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other seniors of the Pill Reserve deeply agreed as well. If such an outstanding student like Chen Xi who possessed such attainments in the Dao of Talismans at such a young age came to cultivate in the Pill Reserve, then it would absolutely be the fortune of the Pill Reserve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi just smiled and stayed silent when facing all this praise while he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart instead and felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted off his shoulders. Truthfully speaking, there was quite a bit of pressure in his heart before he came here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, all of it had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t just restored the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron, but even obtained the friendship of all the seniors from the Pill Reserve and the Xuanyuan Clan. This was what he attached most importance to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were to encounter trouble within the academy in the future, then these seniors would definitely not sit by idly. Even if they didn’t help him, they would absolutely not help another deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was more than enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi, you did well this time.” The Head Enforcer, Li Bei, spoke as well. His cold and stern expression had eased up greatly. Obviously, Chen Xi’s display from before had won a great deal of recognition from Li Bei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the next moment, Li Bei changed the topic and said, “However, even though this matter is resolved, the matter related to the Divinering Dao Transformation Pill hasn’t.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as these words were spoken, the bustling atmosphere in the hall instantly went silent. All the seniors here frowned while Xuanyuan Pojun and the others didn’t conceal their detest and displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chen Xi seemed to have expected this question from Li Bei since the beginning. He stared at the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron and smiled as he interrupted Li Bei. “Senior, wait a moment and you’ll understand yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was calm and revealed a strand of extreme confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’d said to wait for a moment, yet actually, as soon as Chen Xi finished speaking, the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron suddenly emanated a strand of an indescribably mysterious aura that enveloped the entire hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the great figures that participated in the restoration of the cauldron simultaneously sensed an auspicious, peaceful, grand, pure, and thick aura surge through their bodies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It felt like a strand of extremely pure energy was cleansing their Dao Foundation and hearts, and their entire bodies emanated a strand of an indescribable aura of the Grand Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Karmic Luck of the Heaven Dao!” Xuanyuan Pojun’s eyes erupted with strands of dazzling bolts of lightning while he lightly spat out a few words. Every single word he spoke was like a thunderclap that shocked all the seniors present in the hall to the point of being shocked speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of an arc appeared on the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth when he saw this. He glanced at the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron as he muttered in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, those talisman formation diagrams were related to Karmic Luck…</span></p>
