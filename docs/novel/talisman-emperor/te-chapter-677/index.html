 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at the same time, they had to admit that Chen Xi was indeed someone with great karmic luck as he was able to obtain a variety of protection wherever he went, and even the supreme restriction, Dimensional Maze, that even saints would turn pale at the sight of was unable to do anything to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such fortune was something even they couldn’t help but envy.</span></p>

I’ve utilized a secret technique and sacrificed 1,000 years of my lifespan to execute a soul branding technique and have locked onto this kid. We just have to follow along the path he took, and we’ll be able to catch up to and kill him!” Suddenly, a wisp of a cruel expression suffused Ancestor Ling Ya’s gaunt face, and he said gloomily, “Doesn’t this kid receive protection at every corner? We’ll make him open up the way for us while we follow behind, and perhaps we’ll even be able to find that shocking secret treasure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! How courageous of you, Fellow Daoist Ling Ya!”</span></p>

Under the guidance of the tiny cauldron, every single step he took would step on a ‘safe point’ of the Dimensional Maze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this way, he didn’t have to worry about going the wrong way and being completely lost within the restriction.</span></p>

It was filled with all sorts of &nbsp;bizarre scenes and mysterious and unfathomable areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some areas surged with the aura of treasures and seemed to contain precious treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some areas were suffused with strands of refreshing fragrance, and it seemed like a herb garden filled with divine medicine was present there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some even emitted waves of howls that were like the furious roars of Fiendgods and howls of beasts. They were terrifying and caused it to seem like an area that was filled with ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had seen numerous areas like these all along the way, and they were extremely mysterious and seemed like numerous treasure troves. If it was any other person that had come here, the person would have been unable to refrain himself from charging in one after the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi paid no attention to them and remained indifferent. According to what the tiny cauldron said, these mysterious areas were linked to some strange spaces. Perhaps they did indeed contain precious treasures, ancient spirit medicine, and mighty profound techniques… But once one entered these places, one would surely miss the opportunity to obtain the shocking secret treasure that was the most precious in the Door of Profundity, and this was without exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected of the Door of Profundity, it contained boundless profundities that are unimaginable. Perhaps any single one of the secret realms within it would be sufficient to cause a mighty uproar…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed emotionally in his heart while he moved forward. If it wasn’t for the tiny cauldron’s guidance, it would surely be impossible for him to resist such temptation, and he would have charged into one of the secret realms to search for treasure a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you finished refining it?” asked the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head. The tiny cauldron was speaking about the divine tree that was suffused with a divine radiance. It was a strand of the quintessence energy of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree, and it had already transformed into a fist sized crystalline ball that he placed into the Buddha’s Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d tried earlier, yet even with the energy of the Dark Parasol sapling, it was extremely difficult to refine and absorb it in a short period of time, and he could only go into closed door cultivation for a period of time before gradually transforming it into a part of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the quintessence energy contained the force of numerous Grand Dao, and it was sufficient to be equivalent to the sum of numerous Grand Dao Fragments, so it was absolutely not something that could be refined and absorbed overnight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he’d already grasped some Dao Insights within it to a state of perfection, so absorbing them was undoubtedly an enormous waste. So it would be better to spend some time and extract these Dao Insights so that he could give them to Ling Bai, Huo Molei, and the others instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful. Those Earthly Immortal Realm experts left behind a brand on you. Even though you intend to draw them over and make them fight the Xeno-race experts instead, it’s slightly dangerous in the end.” The tiny cauldron reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand.” Chen Xi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve arrived!” After a short moment, the tiny cauldron spoke, and its voice carried a rare wisp of trembling. “I sense the aura of a Chaotic Divine Crystal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked in his heart as he raised his eyes to look over, and he saw an ancient sacrificial altar floating in the distant sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sacrificial altar was as tall as a mountain and constructed from greyish brown rocks, causing it to seem extremely ancient and ordinary, and it didn’t reveal a divine appearance. But it made others feel even more reverent and sense an aura that had shed all grandeur to return to simplicity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Dao moved towards simplicity, and there was nothing showy about it as the Dao was natural. There was only a type of simply fusing with the heavens and the earth and everything within it, and it stood towering within the dusky universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked at from afar, it was like the sacrificial altar constructing by the ancestors of this world for the sake of offering sacrifice to the heavens, and it naturally carried an imposing aura that shook one’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially shocking to Chen Xi was that the entire ancient sacrificial altar was covered in spirit medicine that flickered with divine lights which sprayed down like a rain of light, and they were surging with vital essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of these spirit medicines were even miraculous and actually seemed to have formed intelligence. They took the form of tiny light figures as they sat cross-legged on the branches while surrounded by a rain of light, and their expressions were solemn as if they were comprehending the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This didn’t seem to be intentionally fostered, but these excellent and extraordinary spirit medicines were nurtured from the excellent spirit energy contained within the heavens and the earth here and the vital essence here that was too dense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi saw an Icestar Soul Herb that had gone extinct in the outside world a long time ago growing between the cracks of the rocks on the sacrificial altar. It was completely white and clear as if it was carved out from crystalline snow. Its leaves had tiny silver stellar veins that flowed with a silver brilliance, and they seemed like a pouring waterfall that was exceedingly gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely a divine medicine that could be utilized as an immortal material to refine an immortal pill, and due to it being extinct, such a divine medicine had become priceless long ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hide for now.” The tiny cauldron suddenly spoke via voice transmission. “Those two Xeno-race experts are hiding in the surroundings of the sacrificial altar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked and returned to his senses before silently moving according to the tiny cauldron’s instruction towards a remote corner at the other side of the sacrificial altar.

Once one was at their level of cultivation, it was difficult for ordinary spirit medicines of the world to move them, yet every single one of the spirit medicines they saw now were actually precious treasures they’d only dreamt of. So how could they not be surprised?</span></p>

This sort of feeling was exceedingly complicated, and it caused these Earthly Immortal Realm experts to feel extremely depressed and anxious. There were so many shocking divine treasures that were difficult to come by right before their eyes, but they were unable to approach it, and this was too tormenting!</span></p>

These precious treasures were left behind to be bestowed to people of the later ages. Otherwise, it would be impossible for us to arrive here…” All of the Earthly Immortal Realm experts wracked their brains to find a way to overcome this problem because they wouldn’t leave just like this. Entering a mountain filled with treasures yet returning empty handed was simply intolerable!</span></p>
