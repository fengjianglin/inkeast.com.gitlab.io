He was a top rate figure amongst independent cultivators and a Rebirth Realm expert, and he enjoyed great reputation amongst independent cultivators, causing the disciples of ordinary sects to not dare offend him. He was an existence that people respected everywhere he went, so how could he endure the insults of a junior?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s aura hadn’t arrived at the Rebirth Realm, and this was something numerous people had discerned.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the eyes of everyone, Chen Xi was at most an expert at the Golden Core Realm, and it was precisely because of this that they felt Chen Xi had gone mad after they heard what Chen Xi said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the emaciated old man grabbed out with his hand, and give sharp azure colored blades flew out like bolts of lightning to claw towards Chen Xi’s head.</span></p>

This was a Dao Grade martial technique he’d bitterly cultivated for many years, the Azuresoul Balefulclaw, and it condensed one’s energy into swift and fierce blades that even earth-rank Magic Treasures were unable to defend against. When it claws onto a person’s body, it would instantly claw the person apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unexpectedly, with a swing of Chen Xi’s Talisman Armament, the Dui Sword of Marsh revolved like a vortex, causing the five claw marks in the sky to dissipate instantly like mud that had fallen into an ocean, and it vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emaciated old man was caught off guard and was instantly slapped flying, and he didn’t even have the time to utilize the defensive Magic Treasures he had in his possession.</span></p>

Never had he imagined that he would actually suffer such a humiliation in the blink of an eye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the emaciated old man was completely enraged. “Little kid! You’re courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>

In the next moment, a hand appeared at the other side of the emaciated old man’s face before fiercely slapping down upon it. The latter wanted to dodge, but because Chen Xi’s speed was too swift, he utterly had no time to think and react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another slap struck heavily on his face, slapping the emaciated old man to the point blood sprayed violently from his nose, he saw stars dancing before his eyes, and his head buzzed. A Rebirth Realm expert actually being slapped to such an extent could be said to be extremely unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone in Fort Desolate saw this scene, their jaws almost hit the floor, their eyes were fully opened wide, and all of them had extremely peculiar expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being slapped once by another could be said to be because of being caught off guard. After all, even experts had moments of carelessness, and incidents of failing miserably in an easy task was a common occurrence. But being slapped twice in succession couldn’t be described as being caught off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this that everyone felt dizzy, and they felt as if they sky had fallen down. A Golden Core Realm cultivator had actually slapped a Rebirth Realm expert successively? Who would dare believe it if someone spoke of it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emaciated old man was furious, completely and utterly infuriated. A dignified Rebirth Realm expert like him, an existence that shook the heavens and the earth had actually been slapped successively. If news of this were to spread, he would die from shame!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Rebirth Realm expert would be able to condense their True Essence into Rebirth Wheels after absorbing the Yin and Yang baleful energy of the heavens and the earth, and when utilized against their enemies, it was extremely formidable. In the cultivation world it was said that a single wheel could shatter mountains and rivers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But all of this was useless.</span></p>

Chen Xi’s movements were so swift that it almost seemed like teleportation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Wheel that hadn’t finished condensing returned into the old man’s body once more, and then the emaciated old man was raised in Chen XI’s hands like a little chick before his aged face that was already extremely swollen had another eight slaps struck fiercely upon it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really are a piece of trash. You’re already at such an old age, yet have only comprehended four Dao Insights, and they’re all Minor Daos. It’s simply a miracle that trash like you who’s conceited from his old age was able to live until now. Take these ten slaps as my lesson to you!” After he finished slapping the old man, Chen Xi tossed the emaciated old man out with a raise of his hand, and he seemed as if he was tossing trash away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emaciated old man let out a shrill cry as his body fell heavily to the ground from the third floor before a mouthful of blood sprayed out from his mouth, and then he directly fainted. It was unknown if he was angered to the point of fainting or did he intentionally faint because he was unable to endure the gazes that shot over from the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Rebirth Realm expert, a powerful and influential existence that was respected wherever he went had actually been violently slapped ten times by a Golden Core Realm cultivator and fainted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked to the point their minds went blank as they looked at the emaciated old man who lay on the ground like a dead dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, these moves of Chen Xi’s looked to be relaxed and easy, but it actually utilized all of his strongest abilities. His most formidable ability right now was to rely on the Starsky Wing’s speed that was almost like teleportation to possess an unparalleled and terrifying speed, and then utilizing the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture to counter the moves he encountered. Coupled with the various Grand Dao Insights he’d comprehended, he could be said to possess an impetus that was like lightning as he slaughtered soundlessly and instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But most importantly, the strength of this emaciated old man was too weak. Even though he was a Rebirth Realm cultivator, he was only at the initial-stage of the Rebirth Realm, and his comprehension of Dao Insight was even extremely weak. So it wasn’t the slightest bit strange that he was easily slapped violently by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Realm experts in some of the rooms on the third floor noticed this scene as well, and all of them were exceedingly shocked, so none of them dared come out and provoke Chen Xi. After all, there was a living example, the emaciated old man, laying right before them, and even though they were confident of their strength, they didn’t dare act rashly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi disregarded all this and directly walked into the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a terrifying young man! What a terrifying sword cultivator!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where the heck did this maleficent existence come from? Why haven’t I heard of him? He’s entirely capable of ranking amongst the top 100 of the Allstar Meeting with his strength. No! It’s even extremely likely for him to be ranked in the top 50!”</span></p>

Based on this maleficent existence’s age, he’s surely below that age of 30 and possesses a cultivation at the Golden Core Realm. If he participated in the Allstar meeting, then he would surely become eminent and renowned, right?”</span></p>

Who could refrain from being curious when facing a young expert that could surmount an entire realm to defeat an enemy?</span></p>

The room on the third floor was extremely large and divided into various chambers to refine pills, refine equipment, meditate in silence, and so on and so forth.</span></p>

Since entering the Gloom Forest until now, he’d always passed his time in continuous battles, and in other words, he hadn’t left his combat state even when he entered Fort Desolate. The continuous high intensity battles caused his first reaction when encountering anything to be —&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Do I need to do battle?</span></p>

He was truly too tired during these past days of wandering about on the verge of life and death all day and night. Besides combat, his days were filled with healing his injuries and fleeing for his life. He was like a dancer that danced trippingly on the edge of a blade, having his nerves strained and mind highly concentrated at all times, and he hadn’t relaxed in the slightest for an entire three months of time.</span></p>

When survival and battle occupied all of his time, how could he possibly have the thought of wanting to bathe or dress up?</span></p>

Not only could it be utilized for equipment refinement, it could also bring forth a defensive effect that avoided one from being disturbed while refining.</span></p>

It possessed an extremely superb effect towards materials that were exceedingly difficult to melt, and it couldn’t be any more suitable to be utilized to temper the Talisman Armament.</span></p>

For example, the Azure Divine Wood, Sunforce Metal, Flaming Divine Crystal, and so on and so forth, whereas, the base of the sword was formed from the immortal material, the Sickle of Slaughter. Early on when it was just refined, its quality was already above the top-grade of the earth-rank, and it was merely slightly inferior to a heaven-rank Magic Treasure.</span></p>

What he wanted to do now was to improve the quality of the Talisman Armament by another level and strive to allow it to attain the height of being able to go against a heaven-rank Magic Treasure so that it would be able to fully bring out his strength during battle!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
