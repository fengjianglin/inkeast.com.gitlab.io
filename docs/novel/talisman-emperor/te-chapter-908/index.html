 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those incidents of the past were filled with the glow of blades and the shadow of swords, and it was full of deception and schemes. Even though Bai Wanqing’s tone was flat, Chen Xi was able to discern how soul-stirring it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t say anything and just tightly clenched his fists in secret while puckering his lips in silence. However, he’d firmly remembered all of this in his heart and didn’t dare overlook the slightest detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing’s voice was low and pleasant to the ear, and it carried a warm and gentle tone. “When your father’s strength attained the limit of the Mortal Dimension, your mother finally decided to search according to the treasure map. Moreover, this decision was the beginning of your parents shedding all pretenses with Zuoqiu Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi suddenly thought of something and said, “They went to the &nbsp;Northern Underworld Ocean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing was stunned, and then said with surprise, “You’ve already heard about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded and said, “While I was in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, a senior once told me that the Sect Master of the Saintly Land of Ascension, Miao Yunji, held a grand meeting over 300 years ago, and numerous great figures with extraordinary cultivations had joined it for the sake of searching for a mysterious Star Manor.” <span id="footnote-ref-b3e3"><a href="#footnote-b3e3">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi paused for a moment and continued. “Later on, all of these top figures of the Dark Reverie were defeated by my parents above the Northern Underworld Ocean. Moreover, if it wasn’t for my father, they would have died for sure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing nodded. “You’re right. Numerous figures with monstrous might had gathered on the Northern Underworld Ocean at that time, but they were only the great figures of the Mortal Dimension in the end, and they were far from being a match for your mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Later on, your mother successfully obtained the Star Manor, and you know as well that everyone thought the supreme treasure, River Diagram, was stored within the Star Manor. Zuoqiu Feng was no exception. Thus, on the way back from the Northern Underworld Ocean, Zuoqiu Feng tore off his disguise and launched a surprise attack against your parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that time, even if your parents resisted Zuoqiu Feng jointly, they still suffered a heavy injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can imagine the feeling of seeing your own older brother suddenly striking with a killing blow and intending to kill you to keep you quiet. That sort of feeling almost made Zuoqiu Xue end her life by her own hands. But in the end, she didn’t do that and chose to flee for her life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she spoke up to here, Bai Wanqing raised her head and stared at Chen Xi as she said, “Do you know why she persisted in surviving even though she suffered such pain and such heavy injuries?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi puckered his lips and said, “For the sake of my father?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing shook her head. “No, for your sake! Because she was already carrying you at that time, and if it wasn’t for that, your parents would have dragged Zuoqiu Feng down with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sat upright without moving, yet his fingers were slightly white from being clenched tightly, and his nails sunk deep into his palm, causing drops of blood to flow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no need for Bai Wanqing to continue because he was already clearly aware about what happened next. His parents that were heavily injured and on the verge of death escaped back to his hometown, Pine Mist City, and then they gave birth to him and Chen Hao. After that…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Zuoqiu Feng pursued them all the way there and captured his mother, destroyed the entire Chen Clan, crippled his grandfather’s cultivation, and the whereabout of his father became unknown, whereas he became the Jinx that was known to every household in Pine Mist City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the extremely complicated feelings in his heart before he asked abruptly. “Why did he spare my grandfather, Chen Hao, and me all those years ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, he seemed to have noticed something and spoke while staring blankly. “Was it because…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing nodded, and her beautiful face surged with a wisp of dense guilt and self-blame as she said, “Exactly, it was because of me. Unfortunately, I was a step too late all those years ago, so I was only able to save the three of you. Moreover, with my ability, I was only able to rely on my identity in the Bai Clan to threaten Zuoqiu Feng, yet I was powerless to change anything else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi went silent for a long time before he suddenly knelt down and silently kowtowed three times to Bai Wanqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing supported Chen Xi up while two streams of tears couldn’t help but flow from her eyes, and she shook her head and said, “You should hate me. I was too headstrong all those years ago and wasn’t willing to cultivate, causing my strength to be weak like a useless piece of trash. If it wasn’t for that, you mother wouldn’t have been captured.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she spoke up to here, she raised her hand to wipe of the tear stains on the corners of her eyes and forced herself to smile. “All of this has already passed, and you’ve already grown up. I believe that if your parents find out about all this, they would surely be extremely happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of a firm expression surged into Chen Xi’s eyes as he said, “Don’t worry Aunt Bai, I’ll surely rescue my mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing smiled with a gratified expression, and then she said abruptly after a short while, “You…don’t hate your father, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he shook his head and said, “I used to, and I wasn’t even willing to mention him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing sighed. “Don’t blame your father for leaving without saying goodbye. With his strength at that time, he was indeed capable of leaving behind various top cultivation techniques and Dao Arts, but he didn’t do so in the end. Do you know why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Chen Xi could answer, Bai Wanqing had answered it. “Because he knew that once you or your younger brother obtained strength, you would surely seek revenge, whereas the chances of success against a colossus like the Zuoqiu Clan were too tiny. He only wanted you and your younger brother to live happily and not be swept into this storm because it was enough for him to endure all of this by himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt like a rock was stuck in his chest, and it was heavy to the point it felt difficult for him to breath. He understood his father’s intentions, yet he was still unable to accept such an arrangement for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter what hardships there are, can’t we face it together? Must you endure it all by yourself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, your actions are just like your father’s, aren’t they?” Bai Wanqing stared at Chen Xi and spoke abruptly, “You endured everything by yourself and were unwilling to allow your younger brother to endure such hardships like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi laughed bitterly yet didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, all of these are matters of the past.” After a short moment, Bai Wanqing’s eyes became spirited once more, and she took a deep breath before she said, “With your current ability, you have the qualifications to know all of this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart shock, and he restrained his thoughts and concentrated completely. He knew that Bai Wanqing was about to speak about the most important information!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your father has already passed through the teleportation formation in the Saintly Land of Ascension and snuck into the Immortal Dimension. I’m unable to find out about his whereabout as well.” Bai Wanqing said slowly, “But I have some information about your mother.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

It was controlled by the ancient power of the Immortal Dimension, the Zuoqiu Clan, and Zuoqiu Xue was locked up within it.</span></p>

Coupled with her being a direct descendant of the Zuoqiu Clan all those years ago, even if she was locked up in Iris Immortal Prison, there was no need to worry that she would suffer any harm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“70% like A’Xue, 30% like Chen Lingjun.” Bai Wanqing spoke in a carefree manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Jingchen laughed bitterly and said, “I wasn’t asking about his appearance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what were you asking about?” Bai Wanqing was utterly blunt when facing this older brother of hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was of course asking about his inheritance.” Bai Jingchen grinned and didn’t feel like anything was wrong with this at all, and he didn’t have the slightest bearing of a Patriarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t ask.” Bai Wanqing replied in a very straightforward manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Jingchen was stunned, and then he pulled a long face. “Just look at you. You’re still angry at me? Those bastards from the Zuoqiu Clan suddenly descended to the Mortal Dimension at that time, and I had no other choice but to send you to the Outerealm Battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what about now?” Bai Wanqing raised her head and glanced at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, I’ll naturally drive them out and ask them to fuck off. They’re just a bunch of little ants from the Zuoqiu Clan, and if it wasn’t because of the Zuoqiu Clan, I would have killed them a long time ago.” Bai Jingchen spoke casually, and he revealed an extremely domineering and overbearing aura as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What would we do if the Zuoqiu Clan gets angry from embarrassment and wants to deal with our Bai Clan because of your actions?” Bai Wanqing revealed a solemn expression as she asked seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What else can we do? If worse comes to worse, we’ll slaughter our way back into the Immortal Dimension.” Bai Jingchen spoke casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing knew the weight of these words because it would practically place the entire Bai Clan on the opposing side of the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took a deep breath and said after contemplating, “Was I too…headstrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Jingchen stood up, and his robust figure was like a pillar that held up the sky. He grinned and revealed a mouthful of neat and snow white teeth before he patted Bai Wanqing on the shoulder and said, “There’s no need to worry. I’ll be here even if the sky crumbles down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, he left with large strides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother.” Bai Wanqing blurted out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Jingchen’s figure froze and stood on the spot. He was extremely dazed in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many years has it been? She’s finally willing to call me big brother again…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where’re you going?” Bai Wanqing seemed to have noticed something was off, and she returned to her warm and gentle appearance once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to have a talk with Big Brother. Since I’ve already decided to help that little fellow, there are some things that should be dealt with.” Bai Jingchen took a deep breath and spoke slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He…really is an inheritor of Oracle Mountain,” said Bai Wanqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew a long time ago.” Bai Jingchen waved his hand without turning back, and his robust figure swiftly vanished outside the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Why did you ask me if you knew a long time ago?!” Bai Wanqing scrunched her nose while a heartfelt smile suffused the corners of her mouth. At this moment, she seemed as if she’d returned to the time when she was young. Even if she was headstrong and unruly, and no matter how great the trouble she caused was, her big brother would be there to deal with it for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A’Xue, Little Xi has already grown up. He’s an Earthly Immortal Realm expert, and he’s much more formidable than Chen Lingjun from all those years ago…” After a long time, a faint sigh resounded out within the quiet and beautiful pine tree forest, and it was quickly drowned out by the rustling sounds of the pine trees, causing the atmosphere to become peaceful once more.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
