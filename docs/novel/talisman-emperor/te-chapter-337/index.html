 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crimsonfox and the others didn’t act in this way at the beginning because the space they were in seemed to be boundlessly vast. Actually, it was merely the size of a small hill, but it was enveloped by the Boundless Starsea grand formation, causing an illusion that it was boundlessly vast to be created.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with that was the might of the detonation of golden cores being too terrifying, to the point that even Rebirth Realm cultivators were afraid of being unable to avoid it in time. Choosing to detonate their golden cores at that time would cause its terrifying might to affect the others, so no one was stupid enough to act in that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, almost all of the assassins within the grand formation had perished and only a little over ten remained, whereas around eight of those terrifying ferocious beasts were still alive, causing there to be a great disparity in the strengths of both sides. Crimsonfox and the others had completely fallen into a hopeless situation, and if they didn’t detonate their golden cores, they would face extermination and die miserably under the claws of these ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances, detonating their golden cores had undoubtedly become their only method of turning the situation around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely based on a perception and analysis like this that Chen Xi would have moved away as if he could predict the future to avoid being affected by the explosions caused by the detonation of the golden cores of these assassins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A destructive force that was beyond compare exploded out from within the Boundless Starsea grand formation, it seemed as if mountains were crumbling and tidal waves were surging, and its impetus was terrifying to the extreme. In practically an instant, the entire grand formation was destroyed and vanished without a trace, and then the terrifying force charged into the skies and swept out in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden core within the bodies of cultivators was the foundation of the heavens and the earth cultivators used to step into the Grand Dao, and their entire cultivation was condensed within it. It was like a barrel of gunpowder, and it only needed a tiny spark to emit a might that caused heavens and the earth to collapse and the sun and the moon to be cast into a shade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely the time for a single breath, the trees, rocks, and even spirit energy and the various airflows in the sky within an area of 300m was obliterated within this terrifying force. It was even to the extent that the continuous mountain range that moved up and down exploded to reveal a terrifying pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked at from afar, a mushroom cloud that roiled violently and endlessly blasted up into the sky, and it seemed as if it wanted to blast a hole in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this terrifying might, Chen Xi once again flashed backward explosively for a distance of 3km before stopping. But the airflow in the sky that was violent like blades still cut into his eyes to the point they ached, and it was obvious how terrifying the might of the explosion of golden cores was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Smoke and dust suffused the sky, and it only dissipated after a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi clearly saw the scene of the battlefield before him, he couldn’t help but be shocked in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire ground was covered in broken limbs and shattered bones, the air was suffused with dense and pungent burnt smell, and there were even numerous burnt pits and rifts on the ground…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Chen Xi’s shock, Crimsonfox and Rose were actually still alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the two of them had suffered heavy injuries and were covered in scars, and they were standing on the ruins while gasping for breath, and the vital energy in their bodies were in complete chaos. They were like two people that were on the verge of death, and their vitality was about to dry up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, even though the two of them were lucky to have survived under the terrifying explosion earlier, their bodies had obviously suffered extremely severe injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trace of sorrow flashed past Crimsonfox’s eyes. Only he and Rose remained at the scene, whereas, everyone else had been sacrificed, and they would probably be unable to escape the outcome of facing extermination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s carried out countless missions, yet had never had a single mission that caused him to be in such a sorry state and feel such despair. When he thought of the target of the assassination this time, even with his selective gaze, he had to admit that he’d utterly lost in terms of tactics and planning, and he’d severely underestimated how terrifying his opponent was since the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had he imagined that not only was his opponent’s qi refinement cultivation extraordinary, his opponent was actually a formidable body refiner as well, and even possessed extremely advanced attainments in the Dao of Talismans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What he never expected even more was that not only was his opponent’s strength extremely formidable, his opponent’s ability of utilizing tactics and control of the situation of the battle had attained a height that he could only look up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come out! You devil!” Bitter regret and rage arose in Crimsonfox’s heart for no reason, and a wisp of an unusual red color suffused his face that was pale as a sheet as he shouted out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crimsonfox’s explosive shout caused Rose who was by his side to be stunned, and then her icy cold and peerlessly beautiful face couldn’t help but go dim.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, the target this time is like a devil indeed, and he played with all of us within the palm of his hand…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi hid in the shadows with an indifferent expression, and he seemed to have turned a deaf ear towards Crimsonfox’s shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, he knew extremely clearly that if he were to make an appearance now, then once Crimsonfox and Rose put their lives on the line and detonated their golden cores, just thinking about the consequences caused a chill to run down his spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no reply from the surroundings, and Crimsonfox’s eyes couldn’t help but reveal a trace of despair. He knew that the target was surely concealed in the shadows and might launch a fatal strike at him at any moment, and he similarly understood that his intention of detonating his golden core to take his target down with him had probably a wishful thought of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like I’ll really be perishing here today…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as this thought emerged in his mind, all the resentment, rage, and regret in Crimsonfox’s heart dissipated instantly as it wasn’t an injustice to lose at the hands of an enemy like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng! Beng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, two shapeless arrows tore through the sky and assaulted Crimsonfox and Rose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were facing an attack like this at an ordinary time, then Crimsonfox and Rose would be entirely capable of easily avoiding it. However, at this moment, they’d already suffered from heavy injuries and their entire bodies didn’t have the slightest strength remaining, causing them to be only able to watch as death approached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu! Pu!</span></p>

The Blacksun Pavilion dispatched over 100 assassins this time, and it was sufficient to annihilate a cultivator at the Rebirth Realm.

Obviously, their Dantians were already destroyed. Their expressions were extremely strange, containing despair, frustration, bitter regret… Various emotions were interwoven on their faces, and it was terrifying to the extreme.</span></p>

How could a tiny intermediate-stage Golden Core Realm cultivator like him annihilate over 100 assassins of the Blacksun Pavilion? After all, those every single one of those assassins have experienced over 100 battles, and they’re extremely elite and formidable existences!” Someone muttered involuntarily and felt disbelief.</span></p>

Damnit! The Mirror of Exchange lost effect earlier, causing us to be unable to see exactly what had happened there.” Someone gnashed his teeth as he spoke.</span></p>

He utterly didn’t say a single word and killed on a whim, and there wasn’t the slightest restraint or hesitation.</span></p>
