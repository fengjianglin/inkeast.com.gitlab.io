 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, he wasn’t worried about the safety of Golden Mulberry Village any longer. After it experienced his repair, the might of the Talisman Tower had already attained its limit, and it was even more formidable than before. Unless it encountered the attack of a Heavenly Immortal, otherwise, no one could shake it within 10 years and no one could sway its foundation in 100 years!</span></p>

Violent winds whistled by and gave rise to sands that covered the sky, and it seemed like an expanse of abandoned ruins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he left the village, the scene in the wilderness was like this. It was cold, desolate, and seemed like an expanse of death. Every single inch of earth seemed to have been trampled on countless times by Cosmos Beasts, causing it to be beyond recognition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi flew through here like a flowing ray of light, and he flew along a fixed pathway towards the extreme distance.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps those Cosmos Beasts invaded the Talisman Dimension just like that?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gully covered in craggy rocks was beneath him, and shattered stones lay scattered all over. Chen Xi flew swiftly into the gully, and at the same time, he started vigilantly ceaselessly scanning for anything unusual in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, his Divine Sense detected a tiny black shadow was floating above the extremely distant sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black shadow wasn’t tall and was completely covered in a black robe, and even the person’s figure couldn’t be seen clearly. Based on the person’s outline, it was probably a human. However, when Chen Xi’s Divine Sense touched this mysterious person, this person instantly seemed to have noticed and lowered his head to look towards the area Chen Xi was at!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was horrified and instinctively withdrew his Divine Sense and withdrew his entire aura right away before circulating a supreme profound technique to conceal his aura, temperature, and even all his sense of perception, causing him to seem like a rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d just finished doing this when a peerlessly enormous will flashed past the heavens and the earth and swept past him!</span></p>

Chen Xi instantly felt as if he’d fallen into a pitch black and bottomless abyss, and he felt helpless as if he was on the verge of suffocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent he was already unable to sense fear, and he just felt that he absolutely be doomed if this strand of will were to lock onto him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi practically desperately suppressed all his will and perception into the depths of his body while madly trying to maintain the calmness and clearness of his mind. The bad premonition in his heart grew more and more intense, and it seemed as if so long as he relaxed slightly, he would fall completely into this bottomless abyss and be unable to wake up forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an unknown period of time, this ghastly and cold will withdrew like the tide, and the feeling of helplessness as if he’d fallen into a pitch black and bottomless abyss gradually left Chen Xi’s world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like a person that was on verge of drowning to death and had been suddenly reduced, Chen Xi couldn’t refrain from gasping for breath while the terror in his heart gradually calmed down after a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How terrifying!</span></p>

He was unable to figure out why he would actually encounter such a terrifying existence in the wilderness of the Talisman Dimension, an existence that almost destroyed his firm Dao Heart that had been tempered through blood and battle with the sweep of a single strand of will, and such might seemed to be even more terrifying than the might of a Heavenly Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That black robed person is absolutely a terrifying existence. But why would such a great figure appear at the border of the Talisman Dimension? Could it be that he’s a supreme expert of the Cosmos Beasts?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi contemplated this scene carefully yet was unable to wrap his head around it.</span></p>

On the other side was a golden seal and jade slips that were piled up in an orderly manner.</span></p>

There was only a scroll hanging on a wall at the side of the young woman, and there were only two words written on it ‘Advance Boldly.’</span></p>

Every single stroke and streak revealed resolute drive, and it was like numerous sharp swords that intended to fly out from the scroll.</span></p>

Liang Bing sat upright while jade slips that had already been dealt with lay before her, and there was only a single jade slip that the Ninth Rank Hall had just sent over today laying before her.</span></p>

Moreover, she possessed clear eyes and red lips, and she seemed to be gorgeous yet icy cold. The space between her brows was filled with a tranquil expression while she seemed to be slightly colder than usual.</span></p>

They really are heedless of consequence.”</span></p>
