 <p>Chapter 141 – Entering The Four-Symbols Layer</p>
 <p>Outside the Buddha’s Trial Pagoda.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere became perfectly silent to the point a falling pin could be heard.</p>
 <p>Deathly silence.</p>
 <p>It was boundlessly silent, as no one said a word and everyone’s mind was in a state of shocked daze.</p>
 <p>Since Chen Xi went into battle with Su Jiao and the 100 plus Su Clan Disciples, the gazes’ of everyone present had descended onto this battlefield.</p>
 <p>On one side was the 100 plus Violet Palace Realm cultivators of the Su Clan that represented the entire elite forces of the Su Clan’s younger generation. In other words, they represented the future of the Su Clan, and every one of them would possibly grow into a great figure that was extraordinary.</p>
 <p>On the other side was Chen Xi, Chen Hao, and the seven young disciples of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>There was no need to say anything about Chen Xi, as his current reputation in Dragon Lake City was like the sun in the midday sky.</p>
 <p>Chen Hao wasn’t a well-known figure, but since he’d already cultivated to the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm and mastered Righteous Sword Insight, he was obviously an unsurpassed genius.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, amongst those seven Wanderingcloud Sword Sect disciples, Fei Lengcui was a leading figure in the younger generation of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect and was a genius young girl that was known to all in Dragon Lake City.</p>
 <p>Which of the people present wouldn’t pay attention to such an extravagant line-up?</p>
 <p>As expected, the battle was brutal and full of ups and downs, and it could absolutely be called the most interesting battle since the Hidden Dragon Rankings started, a battle that was bound to be recorded in the history books of Dragon Lake City.</p>
 <p>In this battle, there was the lofty and mighty Righteous Sword Insight, the peerless and ferocious Azureviolet Dualblades that sealed a thousand leagues in ice, and the Triwater Go Prison Formation that was sufficient to annihilate a Golden Core Realm cultivator… But in terms of the most dazzling and most striking, it would surely be Chen Xi without a doubt.</p>
 <p>His combat expertise, strategy, and the strength he exerted were all brilliant and formidable beyond expectations, and it took one’s breath away repeatedly and lead a person to endless meaningful afterthoughts.</p>
 <p>When they saw him being confined by the myriad of chains, everyone thought that he would die for sure, yet when he broke open the chains and stood up, everyone understood that Chen Xi had been concealing his strength since the beginning, like a lone wolf that bore patiently and revealed his fangs at the most dangerous moment!</p>
 <p>School of Fiendgod Body Refinement!</p>
 <p>Shaman Energy!</p>
 <p>A large palm print Divine Ability that covered an area of 300m!</p>
 <p>As they watched the Su Clan disciples die tragically under the terrifying palm print, as they watched Chen Xi slaughter in all directions like an ancient fiendgod, and as they watched him turn around a hopeless situation by himself… All of this was so shocking, so unbelievable, it caused the people present to not dare believe their eyes.</p>
 <p>Only at this moment did they understand that not only was Chen Xi a qi refinement genius that had comprehended Dao Insight, he’d even dual cultivated in the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement to the Violet Palace Realm already and mastered an extremely terrifying Divine Ability!</p>
 <p>Only when Su Jiao left the Buddha’s Trial Pagoda with hatred in her heart did this battle finally draw to a close.</p>
 <p>But to the people present, every scene of this battle and every small detail still replayed in their minds, and they were speechless for a long time.</p>
 <p>“At the age of 17, his cultivation has attained the Violet Palace Realm in both qi refinement and body refinement, and his cultivation in the Martial Dao is at the Dao Insight Stage… This fellow is virtually a genius of a monstrous level!”</p>
 <p>“He schemes ruthlessly, and his strategy was meticulous, to the point it took every possibility into account. If a freak that’s proficient in both strategy and combat were to grow up, how outstanding would he be?”</p>
 <p>“I wonder what other trump cards he hasn’t revealed. With this fellow’s disposition, he would absolutely not reveal all of his trump cards.”</p>
 <p>After an unknown amount of time, the silent crowd burst into an uproar and various waves of sounds sounded out explosively. The variety of topics all revolved around Chen Xi, causing the crowd to seem full of extreme noise and excitement.</p>
 <p>On the jade platform, the expression of the Su Clan’s Patriarch, Su Zhentian, had already become gloomy to a shocking degree, and his expression was extremely savage as his body emitted dense killing intent that was utterly impossible to be concealed.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Su Zhentian was like a volcano that was about to erupt. None of the nearby leaders of the various powers went to provoke him, and there was no way to find out what he was thinking in his heart.</p>
 <p>After all, anyone was able to perceive that the 132 Su Clan Disciples were almost the entire elite force of the Su Clan’s younger generation. Losing almost 100 of them in a short moment could be said to have greatly injured the Su Clan, to the point it was an injury of the bones. It was even to the extent that an embarrassing situation of having no one to succeed the Su Clan might occur, and if it really was like this, then the Su Clan was not far away from decline and annihilation.</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p><i>Unfortunately, I only killed 97 people, and there are still another 35 that crushed their Transportation Talismans and fled… </i>Chen Xi sighed to himself, his gaze swept past the pools of mush on the floor before swinging his sleeve to collect the storage Magic Treasures that were left behind on the ground. After counting all the storage rings, bracelets, belts…. There was actually 73!</p>
 <p><i>A man can’t be rich without a windfall, just like a horse won’t get fat without eating grass all night, our forefathers were telling the truth. These fellows are all Su Clan Violet Palace Realm cultivators, and the wealth within their storage Magic Treasures ought to be extremely abundant, yet it has instead benefitted me. </i>Chen Xi didn’t check the things within the storage Magic Treasures and instead put them all away.</p>
 <p>Even though the Su Clan disciples had either died or fled, the great battle from before had instead drawn countless pairs of eyes to spectate. With Chen Xi’s Divine Perception, he’d noticed over 1,000 people concealed in the surroundings. Thus, this moment wasn’t the time to check his spoils.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, he could easily flee, yet the True Essence of Chen Hao and the other Wanderingcloud Sword Sect disciples had arrived at the state of being dried up. At this moment, if someone took advantage of their weakness after the battle, it would be troublesome.</p>
 <p>“Let’s leave this place first.” Chen Xi swept the surroundings with his gaze before flicking his sleeve, and a treasured vessel appeared out of thin air. Then it carried Chen Hao and the others to tear through the clouds and fly towards an extremely distant place.</p>
 <p>This treasured vessel was given to him by the Old Turtle King, and it was a Magic Treasure. Not to mention its speed being extremely swift, it was even able to withstand the full forced strike of a perfection-stage Violet Palace Realm cultivators, and it was sufficient to be used in the first layer of the pagoda.</p>
 <p>“This fellow’s strength is truly terrifying, he actually dual cultivated in qi refinement and body refinement. Looks like I must be careful when I encounter him the next time. But my Incorporeal Sword Insight has already achieved mastery, and I’m naturally unafraid of him as well.” Not long after Chen Xi left, on a nearby small hill, a young man who wore a scholar’s headdress revealed himself. His brows were dark black like ink, his eyes bright like a hawk, three swords hung on his back, and his entire body was filled with a fierce and arrogant aura. At this moment, he was looking at the treasured vessel that had disappeared in the distant horizon, and he frowned as he silently pondered deeply.</p>
 <p>If someone was here, they would surely be able to recognize the identity of this person. He was precisely the one called Incorporeal Sword, Qiu Leng, a dazzling genius figure that was from one of the eight great sects, the Azuresun Sect.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go! The strength of this person is far from something we can defeat. If we’re unlucky and encounter him, it’s better not to offend this person, and we should flee if we can.”</p>
 <p>“Fortunately, we hadn’t made a move yet. Otherwise, we’d surely suffer the same fate as the Su Clan disciples.”</p>
 <p>“Remember, we must not make an enemy out of this person in the Buddha’s Trial Pagoda.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just the Incorporeal Sword, Qiu Leng, who was spectating the battle from nearby, there were also disciples of the various great powers who’d seen Chen Xi turn around the battle by himself, and a storm of shock and fear had arisen within their hearts long ago. How would they dare have the thought of taking advantage of Chen Xi after he just finished a battle? All of them turned around and left right away, and they utterly didn’t dare chase after Chen Xi’s treasured vessel.</p>
 <p>In a concealed gorge.</p>
 <p>A treasure vessel swiftly descended, then Chen Xi, Chen Hao, and the others walked down and entered into a concealed crack in the rock at the side, and behind the crack in the rock was surprisingly a natural cave.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi’s gaze sized up the surroundings for a while before nodding slowly. If it wasn’t for his Divine Perception being exceedingly strong, he would really be difficult for him to know that a cave existed here, and it was extremely suitable to be used for recuperation.</p>
 <p>“Chen Hao, you, Miss Fei, and the others should make the best use of your time and recover your strengths. If I’m not wrong, we might be transported to the second layer of the pagoda later.” Chen Xi instructed.</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Chen Hao nodded. He knew as well that the 2,000 cultivators that were able to enter the second layer, the Four-Symbols Layer, were all outstanding figures that had experienced slaughter after slaughter to emerge from the numerous participants. If he wanted to defeat them and enter into the third layer, the Yin-Yang Layer, in the end, then recovering his strength was the most pressing matter at the moment.</p>
 <p>Fei Lengcui and the others knew that the situation was pressing as well and didn’t say anything further. At this moment, all of them admired Chen Xi’s cultivation extremely, and it could be said they would act upon anything Chen Xi said. They sat down cross-legged right away before taking out some spirit liquid to start circulating their cultivation techniques and recover their strength.</p>
 <p>“Ling Bai, properly guard the entrance to the cave, I need to recover for a while as well,” said Chen Xi via voice transmission.</p>
 <p>“Leave it to me. I guarantee I’ll kill anyone that comes.” Ling Bai has already become extremely bored from staying in the storage ring, he flew to the entrance of the cave with raging killing intent when he heard Chen Xi, and his little body stood ramrod straight.</p>
 <p>Ling Bai’s cultivation was sufficient to be on par with a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, and he himself had inherited the supreme Nirvana Sword Dao of his Master. In this pagoda where the highest cultivation was only at the Violet Palace Realm, he was simply a supreme existence, and with him guarding the entrance to the cave, Chen Xi was naturally able to be extremely at ease.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi didn’t waste any more time. He found a place to sit down cross-legged before taking out a bottle of spirit liquid and circulating the Ice Crane Technique, and then he closed his eyes as he recovered his strength.</p>
 <p>Three hours later.</p>
 <p>Chen Hao, Fei Lengcui, and the others successively awoke from their recuperation, they had clear gazes and were brimming with energy and vitality, and their strengths had actually somewhat improved. Obviously, experiencing the soul-stirring fierce battle from before had brought about an extremely great beneficial effect to their cultivations. This was the charm of live battle, as after one experienced numerous baptisms from the flames of battle, it would be strange if one’s strength didn’t improve.</p>
 <p>“What cultivation technique does your older brother cultivate? It’s actually more profound than the Wanderingcloud Blackhole Technique that we cultivate.” Fei Lengcui looked over, she saw the surroundings of Chen Xi who sat cross-legged on the ground was suffused with a profound ice aura that seemed like a layer of ice crystals, and every breath he took was long, continuous, and possessed ample strength. It was like he was swallowing and spitting out an ice dragon that whistled out in the sky as it moved about with a myriad of phenomenon left in its wake.</p>
 <p>Chen Hao shook his head and said, “I and my brother have already not seen each other for two years. He was at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm two years ago, and he cultivated the Violet Sky Arts that was passed down from my clan ancestors. As for what cultivation technique he’s cultivating now, even I don’t know.”</p>
 <p><i>He was only at the 3</i><i>rd</i><i> level of the Congenital Realm two years ago?</i></p>
 <p>It wasn’t only Fei Lengcui, even the other six Wanderingcloud Sword Sect disciples were shocked in their hearts when they heard this, and a wisp of shock suffused their faces.</p>
 <p>“Looks like your brother ought to have acquired a great fortuitous encounter. In the time of two years, he’s attained the 6th star of the Violet Palace Realm and a body refinement cultivation at the Violet Palace Realm as well. Such natural talent, even I am unable to compare to him.” Fei Lengcui shook her head and spoke in self ridicule.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister, who doesn’t know that you’re only 17 now, yet you’ve already stepped into the 9th level of the Violet Palace Realm, and you’re even soon to condense an Icy Snow Dao Territory that belongs to you. Who in our Wanderingcloud Sword Sect is able to compare to you?” The disciples called Qing Luo spoke out, and his voice carried heartfelt admiration.</p>
 <p>“I can’t compare to Chen Hao. He’s only entered the sect for two years, yet he’s already cultivated from the Congenital Realm to the 7th level of the Violet Palace Realm, and he has even comprehended the Righteous Sword Dao that’s one of the top Dao Insights in the heaven and earth. Chen Hao will probably become one of the 36 Elite Disciples of our Wanderingcloud Sword Sect in a few years.” Fei Lengcui looked at Chen Hao and smiled as she spoke.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Junior Brother Chen Hao’s natural talent can indeed be said to be extraordinary, and it’s truly enviable.” The others nodded as well.</p>
 <p>“Extraordinary? So long as you cultivate bitterly and diligently and wholeheartedly seek the Dao, then anyone can achieve it. To become a so-called genius, besides natural talent, diligence and hard work are the most important.” Chen Xi woke up from his meditation, and he spoke with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>He’d already recovered all of his True Essence now, and he faintly had the feeling that he would soon breakthrough. He knew that it wouldn’t be long before he’d surely step into the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm. Moreover, after absorbing the energy of the stars from two Starsoul Meteorites, the Shaman Energy within his body had become even denser, but there was still quite a distance before he could advance to the next level.</p>
 <p>“Based on my calculations, a few hours have already passed since we entered the Eight-Directions Layer. After a period of battle, the cultivators in the Eight-Directions Layer at this moment are probably not far away from the number of 2,000. Let’s wait here, as it’s better to conserve and store up our strength.” Chen Xi spoke slowly.</p>
 <p>Om!</p>
 <p>However, right when he just finished speaking, a special vortex abruptly appeared in the sky above every single one of them, and a tremendous suctions force swept out. In the next moment, Chen Xi and the others had all vanished on the spot.</p>
 <p>Obviously, amongst the 10,000 plus Violet Palace Realm cultivators that had entered the Eight-Directions Layer, over 8,000 had already been eliminated now, and all the remaining 2,000 cultivators had been transported into the second layer of the pagoda — The Four-Symbols Layer!</p>
