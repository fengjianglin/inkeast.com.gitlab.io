 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one spoke in the vessel, causing the atmosphere in it to seem depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Bai stood silently at the stern with a livid expression, and his gaze was icy cold and fierce. His fists that were enveloped beneath his sleeve were clenched together tightly while his nails had sunk deep into his palm, causing a line of scarlet red blood to pour down, yet he seemed to be completely unaware.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Kui laid lazily and weakly by Ling Bai’s side, and he seemed as if he couldn’t even be bothered to open his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui glanced at Ling Bai and Bai Kui with worry, and the space between his brows revealed a wisp of gloominess and rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A’Man deviated from his usual behavior and was sitting cross-legged on the ground with a calm expression. He was doing his best to cultivate, and circle after circle of thick and formidable fluctuations were rising from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei and Mo Ya were silent as well. Both of them were silently supervising the cultivation of the youths from the Ninth Hell Tribe. The battle from before was too terrifying, and even though they didn’t suffer any material harm, the souls of the youths had been affected. So if they didn’t repair it in time, it would probably leave behind injuries that couldn’t be healed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi was calmly refining the Talisman Armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The might of the Talisman Armament was already slightly more formidable than an ordinary Immortal Artifact, yet it was far from completely unearthing the potential of the Talisman Armament because the five Divine Talismans that resided within the Talisman Armament hadn’t arrived at the state of being able to ‘communicate with the gods.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that step was too far away. Chen Xi had to at least be at the Heavenly Immortal Realm to sense these so-called ‘gods of the world,’ so he was continuing to unearth and expand the potential of the Talisman Armament now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His methods were very simple, it was to inscribe the Darklightning Divine Talisman, Demonspirit Divine Talisman, Phoenixwind Divine Talisman, and Eastern Myrtle Divine Talisman on the Talisman Armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the five element divine talismans from before, these four new divine talismans were similarly from the inheritance of Oracle Mountain. But they were passed down to the four great figures that created the Talisman Dimension by the Founding Ancestor of Oracle Mountain, Fuxi. It was precisely because of this that those four divine talismans had become the inherited secret technique of the Liang, Gu, Yin, and Luo Clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was in the Talisman Dimension, Li Yang had passed down these four divine talismans to Chen Xi, and at this point, he’d already grasped the technique of inscribing nine divine talismans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Chen Xi’s estimations, when these four divine talismans were inscribed completely, it would be time to improve the quality of the Talisman Armament once again. At that time, he only had to gather sufficient immortal materials to improve the might of the Talisman Armament to a completely new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the vessel, everyone tended to their own matters, causing the atmosphere to seem even more oppressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Mortis seemed to be completely ignorant to everything in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The appearance of Saint Emperor Gui Su and the departure of A’xiu had caused a ball of the flames of rage to burn in the hearts of everyone including Chen Xi, and it was from their dissatisfaction towards their own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps their strength as a whole already stood proudly at the peak of the Mortal Dimension. But when facing a terrifying existence like Saint Emperor Gui Su, they were still like ants that couldn’t withstand a single blow, and they were weak and powerless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That feeling of having their fate grasped in the hands of others and being trampled on at will caused all of them to feel extremely furious and aggrieved, and they didn’t want to experience it a second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So they started to consciously scrutinize themselves once more. They stopped being over absorbed in the past, and they placed their gazes further into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few hours later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vast and lofty mountain range appeared within their fields of vision, and it was like a spinal cord that lay across the heavens and the earth. Moreover, the peaks of the mountains were suffused with dense violet colored Immortal Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looking down at this mountain range from high above in the sky, it was like an enormous dragon residing that with a winding figure that was filled with the violet qi of kings. Every day when the sun rose, these mountains would be enveloped in a layer of violet colored mist that was solemn, heavy, and revealed the aura of a king.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violet qi that came from the east. This was a rare paradise where Dragon Veins gathered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Violet Thistle Mountain Range, the place the Bai Clan resided on, and a place that caused the cultivation world of the Dark Reverie to feel both hate and reverence towards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, on a spacious plain between the mountains was a handsome young man in clothes that were whiter than snow and a jade white countenance. He held a jade fan that had designs painted in gold, and the face of the fan had 18 enchanting and charming beauties on it, causing it to be extremely striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was on the battlefield, then a fellow that was dressed up so flashily would surely become the first target of the enemy because he was too striking. Who else would they kill but him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone that dared to be dressed up so flashily and brazenly stand between the mountains was naturally the disciple of the Bai Clan — Bai Gunan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed to have been waiting for a long time and was fanning the jade fan in his boredom, and he seemed to be listless. But when he saw the treasured vessel that tore through the sky towards him, his backbone straightened while his eyes lit up, and he was filled with spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A friend has come from afar, what a pleasure!” He roared with laughter and seemed to be extremely delighted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is still so flashy…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the stern, when Chen Xi saw Bai Gunan who wore snow white clothes, had his hair combed meticulously, and held the jade fan with beauties on it, the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth couldn’t help but curl into a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck! The Earthly Immortal Realm! Freak!” Bai Gunan leaped up onto the treasured vessel before sizing Chen Xi up from head to toe, and then he couldn’t refrain from cursing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still remembered that when he and Chen Xi parted in Blaze City that day, Chen Xi’s cultivation was only at the Nether Transformation Realm. Now it had only been a little over ten years since they met last, yet Chen Xi had actually advanced into the Earthly Immortal Realm. This caused him to be both envious and shocked, and he warned himself in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I absolutely must not compare myself with this freak because it’ll anger me to death…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan had naturally been instructed by Bai Jingchen to wait here and welcome Chen Xi. Of course, if it wasn’t Chen Xi that was coming, then with his overbearing character, he wouldn’t bring himself down to the point of doing something that a servant ought to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, my Little Aunt has returned. But it’s not advisable for her to make an appearance in public. You know as well that no matter what power it is in the world, there’s always no lack of struggles within the power. Those stubborn and conservative old fellows have stopped thinking about how to kill enemies in the Outerealm Battlefield, and they’ve instead put their energy on internal strife. Unfortunately, this sort of thing can’t be avoided in my Bai Clan as well.” After they engaged in some small talk, Bai Gunan roughly told Chen Xi about the situation in the Bai Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to what Bai Gunan said, the internal strife of the Bai Clan seemed to have formed into two factions. One faction was led by the Patriarch, Bai Jingchen, whereas the other faction was led by the Grand Elder, Bai Cheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the root of this internal strife was actually related to Chen Xi as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very simple. The Grand Elder’s faction was on extremely friendly terms with the Zuoqiu Clan. Moreover, they’d received the instructions of the Zuoqiu Clan on many occasions since a long time ago that they should severe all connections with Zuoqiu Xue, and at the necessary moment, they even had to apprehend and kill some enemies of the Zuoqiu Clan like Chen Xi and his father, Chen Lingjun, and play the role of spokesmen of the Zuoqiu Clan in the Mortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Bai Jingchen’s faction didn’t intend to attach themselves to anyone, nor had they thought of climbing up the tree that was the Zuoqiu Clan. But because of Bai Wanqing, Bai Jingchen’s faction sided more towards Zuoqiu Xue.</span></p>

After all, Zuoqiu Xue’s whereabouts were unknown, and no one knew if she’d been captured back to the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this was something that Chen Xi had never heard of in the past, and he just found out from Bai Gunan at this moment, causing his heart to feel even heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even people from an ancient and great power like the Bai Clan that no one in the Dark Reverie dared to offend were willing to play the role of underlings for the Zuoqiu Clan, so it obviously displayed how terrifying the might the Zuoqiu Clan possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So in this way, my arrival to the Bai Clan this time might be me jumping into a pit of flames?” Chen Xi restrained his thoughts and asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan roared with laughter, and then he patted his chest while he said in a heroic manner, “Don’t worry, you have me. If anyone dares to fucking touch a hair on your body, then I’ll break his fucking legs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s brows raised.</span></p>

So my words are useless sometimes. But you don’t have to worry because no one dares to go too far with Uncle and Little Aunt here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t take Bai Gunan’s guarantee seriously because the matter of him being the son of Zuoqiu Xue and Chen Lingjun was something that all the higher-ups of the Bai Clan were clearly aware of since the beginning.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, whether they dared to play with fire or not in the end depended on whether he could obtain the acknowledgement of the entire Bai Clan. At the bottom of it all, it depended on whether the strength he displayed was sufficiently formidable.</span></p>

With a flick of his finger, a screen of light shot out from with the jade slip, and then the figure of a thin young man appeared in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young man had a gloomy appearance, yet he possessed a pair of beautiful peach blossom shaped eyes. The outline of his face was firm as if carved with a blade while his hair had a thick and glossy braid and was coiled into a bun behind his head, causing a plump forehead to be revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man’s eyes were slightly narrowed while his figure was ramrod straight, and he revealed an indescribable and unique charm. He was like a vicious yet beautiful copperhead snake, and he gave others a ghastly and bloody impression.</span></p>

Her hair hung loosely like a waterfall until her waist while her appearance could be considered to be pretty. But the right side of her face was hidden behind a pitch black mask, and this mask was suffused with a metallic and icy cold sheen.</span></p>
