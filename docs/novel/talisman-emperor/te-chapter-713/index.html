 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially Ren Pingping, she was shocked to the point her jaw almost hit the ground, and her entire body was trembling. Even though she lay in the embrace of the young man, yet she didn’t feel a trace of warmth because even the greatest outside help in her heart seemed like a mouse that had encountered a cat. So how could she maintain her composure? Instantly, she felt that she’d really bit off more than she could chew this time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she didn’t dare believe all this because it was too absurd. After all, this was a disciple of the Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan, and he was a Young Master that was renowned throughout the entire cultivation world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if the disciples of the 10 great immortal sects were to encounter him, they would feel he was an extreme headache and stay as far from him as they could. It wasn’t because he possessed a formidable cultivation, but because his background was too shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Bai Clan was famous for being protective. No matter right or wrong, someone who offended them would be unable to escape some punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young man in embroidered clothes who was before her possessed this towering tree, the Bai Clan, as his reliance, and he’d seemed to have become a dreadful monster than caused everyone he met to have a headache and be worried about getting into trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no one had expected that he would actually be like an obedient child before that handsome young man, and who would believe such news if news of this was spread?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, the young man in embroidered clothes was Bai Gunan. He’d once been fiercely slapped in public by Chen Xi at the highest level of the Ice Cloud Pavilion, and he still clearly remembered those humiliating scenes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He originally intended to find some help after he left Icesky City to deal with Chen Xi, but his heart instantly went cold when he encountered a cousin brother in the clan, and it completely put out any thoughts he had of looking for trouble with Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also from that moment onwards that he found out the damnable fellow that deserved to be sliced up by a thousand blade actually possessed a close relationship with his aunt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that his aunt had looked after this bastard for many years while this bastard was still young! Not to mention him, Bai Gunan, even the children of the Patriarch didn’t enjoy such treatment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he almost covered his face and left as far as he could at the instant he saw Chen Xi, but he still forcefully restrained this impulse in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be helped. He was the dignified clansmen of the Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan. It would be too embarrassing if he turned around and left in front of so many people, and it would bring shame to the clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t know how many thoughts had arisen in Bai Gunan’s heart in this instant, and he continued to grin as he asked. “Then do you want to stand up for this woman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and pushing away Ren Pingping who was within his embrace. “No. Since this woman dared to offend you, then she’s going against me. What do I need her for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene caused the bodies of everyone present to tremble as they never expected a single word from Chen Xi would actually cause Bai Gunan to so ruthlessly abandon Ren Pingping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention then, even Chen Xi was stunned, and he couldn’t help but shake his head as he looked at Ren Pingping who was on the ground and in an extremely embarrassing state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master Bai, you… The Young Miss has always been devoted to you, yet you treat her like this, how could you bear to do this!?” The old man forcefully restrained his rage as he spoke in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When did I treat her unfairly?” Bai Gunan’s brows raised as he revealed a ferocious expression. He could lower his head when facing Chen Xi, but he recovered his arrogant and overbearing disposition when dealing with others, and he pointed at the old man. “Don’t push your luck. Wasn’t your Ren Clan able to develop from a small clan into its current scale because of me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, he spat fiercely as he pointed at Ren Pingping who was on the ground, and he said fiercely. “Don’t take me for a fool. You’ve been fucking flirting and having secret relations with that pretty boy behind this Young Master’s back all through these past few years, yet I couldn’t be bothered to deal with you. After all, the relationship between us is just for fun, but can you strike your chest and say you’re devoted to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Chen Xi, their relationship is so complicated.” Blackie muttered in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even I don’t understand the world of Young Masters.” Chen Xi shrugged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ren Pingping originally displayed a bitter expression and a pitiable appearance with the intention of regaining Bai Gunan’s pity. But never had she imagined that she wasn’t able to persuade him to stay but was subject to a string of curses instead, causing her entire body to go cold as her heart fell into an abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan was right, the rise of her Ren Clan couldn’t absolutely not do without the support of Bai Gunan, and it was even to the extent that this Treasure Gathering Pavilion was a business Bai Gunan had bestowed upon the Ren Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master Bai, I was wrong, please…please forgive me, alright? I won’t dare do it again, I swear…” Ren Pingping was in utter panic as she knelt before Bai Gunan and pleaded with a sorrowful voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck off!” Bai Gunan kicked her away in an extremely heartless manner. “I’ll kill you if you annoy me again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” The old man was overwhelmed with rage to the point his entire body trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You want to be annihilated along with the Ren Clan?” Bai Gunan glanced at the old man with an expression filled with disdain. “Quickly fuck off! Don’t be an eyesore here! Don’t blame me for not warning you if you don’t vanish from before my eyes within the time of three breaths!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s expression turned pale while he seemed to be indeterminate. Even though he was disgruntled, he could only sigh dejectedly in the end before supporting Ren Pingping up and leaving the Treasure Gathering Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Ren Pingping, he was utterly unable to figure out who exactly that handsome young man was and why Bai Gunan would become so resolute and heartless for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong San was completely stunned and was in disbelief because not only did Ren Pingping formidable outside help not cause any harm to Chen Xi, he was instead like a mouse that had encountered a cat and actually kicked Ren Pingping away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that Senior Chen Xi is…a disciple of an extraordinary power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, Hong San’s heart let him down and started thumping because any disciple of a famous sect was beyond reach to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had he imagined that interaction would actually arise one day between him and such a figure, and this caused him to feel that it was slightly unreal as if he was dreaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, are you satisfied now?” After the two of them left, a slight smile instantly gushed out onto Bai Gunan’s face, and the speed he changed his expression was so swift it stunned all those youths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re worried I’d kill them, right?” Chen Xi smiled spuriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could I possible do that? If you want to kill them, then I’ll grab them back here right now.” Bai Gunan had indeed been bullied by Chen Xi to the point of being afraid, and he spoke carefully as he was deeply afraid of offending Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll let this matter go at that. Now that I speak of it, I have to thank you this time. After all, you helped me with quite a bit,” said Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re too kind, truly too kind. We’re like family so there’s no need to be courteous.” Bai Gunan laughed loudly and seemed to have already taken Chen Xi to be part of his clan. “Right, did Brother Chen come here for the sake of purchasing treasures? Do you need me to help select them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already finished selecting them.” Chen Xi declined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want to have too much contact with this fellow because if Yan Shisan was said to be a madman, then this fellow was a troublemaker. So if he did become friends with this fellow, he would probably have to be careful about trouble coming to look for him at all times.</span></p>
