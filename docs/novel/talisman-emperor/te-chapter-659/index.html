If news of Chen Xi being capable to achieve such an accomplishment was to be spread, it would be sufficient to shock the world.</span></p>

The glow of blood shot through the sky as rays of lights roiled like the tide, and the horrifying and terrifying sounds of battle and collision were like the terrifying sound of the earth collapsing or a volcano erupting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi rampaged through within the battle while the bloody sword shot out like bolts of lightning. Every single strike seemed capable of moving the gods as it reaped life after life, and it was ferocious, powerful, swift like a bolt of lightning, and terrifying to the extreme.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood dyed his clothes and hair red, causing him to be like a god of devils that trampled on the world and everything within it with an imposing aura, and everywhere the blade of his sword went, all obstacles before him would be swept away.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magic treasure after magic treasure was slashed apart by him, Dao Art after Dao Art was eliminated by him, and enemy after enemy was killed amidst shrill cries and transformed into severed limbs that fell from the sky and tainted the heavens red while soaking the entire world with blood.</span></p>

It seemed as if he was a war god that would never be exhausted, and he shocked everyone present.</span></p>

How could such a freak exist in this world?</span></p>

He was unable to imagine how they were still incapable of doing anything to Chen Xi under such a situation!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a cultivator at the Nether Transformation Realm as well, he knew extremely clearly about exactly how great the consumption of True Essence was when exerting multiplied combat strength. No matter how solid and vast a person’s Blackhole World was, there would be a time that it dried up.</span></p>

He felt he was simply like a piece of trash when compared to Chen Xi and was unable to chase up to Chen Xi’s footsteps any longer b</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ut in the next moment, he woke up from his disordered thoughts because he saw that Chen Xi had actually charged towards him and that icy cold and emotionless gaze terrified him to the point his soul almost left his body, so how could he dare to continue being lost in thought?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He fled repeatedly and dodged to the back of the crowd as he was deeply afraid of being locked onto by Chen Xi, because he didn’t have the slightest will to fight when facing this brutal god of slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, you must persist…” Feng Jianbai howled loudly once more. However, before he could finish speaking, he noticed to his shock that Chen Xi had actually appeared abruptly before him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>

He’d just advanced to the Nether Transformation Realm and was even inferior to Leng Qiu, Du Xuan, and the others, so how could he possibly be a match for Chen Xi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this be possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Jianbai was slapped to the point his head droned while stars danced before his eyes, and he still didn’t dare believe the scene before him. When he looked towards the surroundings out of the corner of his eyes, he instantly seemed as if he was struck by lightning.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It turned out that since an unknown period in time, those experts that came from the various powers had already fled towards all direction as their will to fight had been completely crushed beneath Chen Xi’s unmovable imposing aura, and there was actually no one that dared come forward and offend him again.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they didn’t flee, all of them had avoided to the side and didn’t dare to charge forward like before. After all, the combat strength Chen Xi revealed was too terrifying, so how could they dare continue risking their lives?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These bastards! They’re simply a useless and disorderly mob!</span></p>

Unfortunately, he’d forgotten that he wasn’t a commander that commanded the entire army, and he was only a despicable fellow that fanned the flames from the shadows.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention all those experts were from the various powers of the Dark Reverie, every single one of them was arrogant, unruly, and had their own thoughts, so how could they possibly listen to his orders?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So blaming others at a time like this was simply laughable to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, you can’t kill me! I’m a Seed Disciple of the Truth Embrace Sect now. Could it be that you want to go against the Truth Embrace Sect? Do you want your Nine Radiance Sword Sect to go to war with my Truth Embrace Sect?” When he saw Chen Xi walking over once again, Feng Jianbai was terrified to the point his entire body trembled, and he howled repeatedly. “Not to mention, my Senior Brother Daoist Crimson Sun is within the Dark Parasol’s Abyss now, so you won’t be able to live for long if you kill me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go to war? Aren’t you thinking too highly of yourself? I even dared to kill the members of the Yazi Clan, so how the fuck can you compare?” Chen Xi took a step forward with an icy cold and indifferent expression before raising his hand to slap Feng Jianbai, and it struck him to the point his teeth fell out while blood sprayed from all the aperture on his face, causing his face to be in a mangled and horrifying state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death! No one in the Dark Reverie can allow a devil like you to continue existing!” Feng Jianbai let out a shrill and miserable cry and was terrified to the point his entire body started trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How laughable! Only you are allowed to kill, yet others aren’t allowed to kill you?” Chen Xi shook his head while speaking with a voice that was filled with disdain, and he already couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath, so he lifted the bloody sword up before slashing it down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of the experts from the various powers that hadn’t fled yet trembled when they saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow Chen Xi is simply too cold. His strength is formidable and he doesn’t care about any threats. How terrible would he be once he grows?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

If it was an ordinary person, the person would probably be utterly incapable of dodging and could only wait helplessly for death to arrive.</span></p>

That’s…” Everyone was shocked and gasped. From their point of view, they just happened to be able to see an imperceptible figure seemed to have appeared out of thin air behind Chen Xi before stabbing with his sword!</span></p>

It was without completely traceless and seemed as if the person was already concealed there since before and had appeared silently. If it was any one of them, they would be utterly incapable of avoiding this attack.</span></p>

At practically the instant the surprise attack appeared, he’d swiftly turned around and shot out explosively while the bloody sword swept out horizontally!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Every single step back he took caused even space to be crushed beneath him, and it was obvious how violent that energy he faced was.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure retreated continuously for over 30m in distance before stopping.
