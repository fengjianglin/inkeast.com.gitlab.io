 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the great hall where the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuanyuan Pojun?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He returned so quickly? Oh, there are also some supreme talisman formation grandmasters from the Xuanyuan Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the seniors here discussed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron, Xuanyuan Pojun was silent while he stared fixedly at it. Near him was a few supreme talisman formation grandmasters, and they were studying the talisman formation diagrams within the cauldron with concentration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These supreme talisman formation grandmasters had been brought over by Xuanyuan Pojun from his clan, and they’d come with a single objective, to try their best to restore the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pill Reserve’s Dean, Chen Haotian, the Vice Dean Mo Linghai, and all the other seniors of the academy didn’t disturb them because all of these figures were able to discern that Xuanyuan Pojun was filled with anxiety and worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short period of time, a supreme talisman formation grandmaster shook his head and sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is it?” asked Xuanyuan Pojun. He had a towering figure, brows that were shaped like bolts of lightning, and he was like an unrivaled god as he stood there casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have the slightest idea.” The supreme talisman formation grandmaster spoke bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Pojun’s dense brows knit together before he waved his hand and said, “Continue deducing! If all eight of you supreme talisman formation grandmasters can’t even deal with a damaged talisman formation diagram, then it would simply be an embarrassment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t hold back in the slightest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Xuanyuan Pojun, his disposition was sharp like a sword, violent like a blade, and since he cultivated until now, he’d always been famous for being courageous, fearless, and straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely because of this disposition that many people called him Madman Xuanyuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time flowed by bit by bit, and the atmosphere within the hall grew even more heavy and oppressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with the passage of time, the expressions of these supreme talisman formation grandmasters from the Xuanyuan Clan become heavier and heavier while their brows knit together tightly. They seemed to have encountered a problem that they were unable to figure out no matter how they wracked their brains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could faintly notice bewilderment, frustration, surprise, vexation, and so on and so forth on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was naturally impossible for Xuanyuan Pojun to not notice all of this, causing his mood to become even more anxious as well, and there was a wisp of rage condensing faintly between his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist Pojun, I think we should think of another way.” Chen Haotian spoke in a low voice. He was slightly worried that if this were to continue, then this madman, Xuanyuan Pojun, might lose his temper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for that. This matter arose because of me, so it should naturally end because of me as well. If these clansmen of mine are unable to deal with it, then if worse comes to worse, I’ll admit my mistakes to the Dean.” Xuanyuan Pojun waved his hand as he spoke resolutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! Even all the supreme talisman formation grandmasters of my Pill Reserve are helpless against this. I think you can just forget it and stop making unnecessary effort.” A cold grunt resounded abruptly, and it seemed to be rather jarring to the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Pojun turned around and saw Zuoqiu Sheng laughing coldly at him. This caused his brows to suddenly raise, and then a wisp of cold light that was like the cold glow of a blade suddenly arose from his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, a strand of terrifying killing intent suddenly effused out and threw the flow of qi and space into chaos. It caused everyone to feel as if they were about to be dragged down into a bottomless abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was horrified, especially Zuoqiu Sheng. His fair and fat face suddenly twitched and lost all its color while his figure staggered, causing him to almost fall to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Haotian’s heart jerked when he saw this, and he immediately said loudly, “Fellow Daoist Pojun, calm your rage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! Even if I, Xuanyuan Pojun, were to suffer a calamity &nbsp;right now, there’s no place for a damnable fatty like you to interfere!” Xuanyuan Pojun grunted coldly before he withdrew his gaze, and the strand of terrifying killing intent was withdrawn into his body like tidewater as he recovered his calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Sheng was both terrified and furious, and he gritted his teeth while he sneered in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madman Xuanyuan, I’ll let you run wild for now. Let me see how you give the Dean an explanation once you’re unable to restore the cauldron! You even vainly attempted to refine a Divinering Dao Transformation Pill, that’s a prohibited pill! It was prohibited by the Dean himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cousin Brother? You’ve returned so soon?” Meanwhile, someone walked in from outside the hall. He wore violet clothes and had a dignified expression. He was Xuanyuan Tong. He was surprised and delighted when he saw Xuanyuan Pojun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where did you go? It has already come to this, yet you left this hall?” Xuanyuan Pojun frowned instead. He was rather worried in his heart, so he spoke even more bluntly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Tong laughed bitterly. He really understood Xuanyuan Pojun’s mood, so he wasn’t offended by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third Ancestral Uncle went to look for me, and I went to look for Chen Xi.” A clear and melodious voice resounded from outside the hall. Accompanying this voice was A’xiu’s graceful and lively figure that appeared within everyone’s fields of vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A’xiu?” Xuanyuan Pojun was stunned, and he said with a frown, “What did you come here for, little girl?” Even though he spoke like this, his voice had eased up greatly. Obviously, he rather doted upon this junior of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu had her hands behind her back while she walked into the hall with a grin on her face. She didn’t feel anything was wrong at all with a junior like her making an appearance before so many seniors of the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She said when she arrived near the cauldron, “Second Ancestral Uncle, I naturally came to restore the cauldron. If you’re unwilling, then I’ll leave right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop playing around!” Xuanyuan Pojun berated her without the slightest thought when he heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other seniors couldn’t stop themselves from chuckling and smiling without end as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll really leave?” A’xiu blinked and smiled as she looked at Xuanyuan Pojun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Pojun was angry and was just about to wave his hand to make her leave immediately when Xuanyuan Tong stopped him. “Cousin Brother, listen to what A’xiu has to say first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw Xuanyuan Tong actually spoke on behalf of A’xiu, it wasn’t just Xuanyuan Pojun who was stunned, even the other seniors restrained their smiles as they realized A’xiu didn’t seem like she was joking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zuoqiu Sheng laughed coldly without end. Obviously, he was rather disapproving towards this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi will come over ten days from now, and he’ll help us restore the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron.” A’xiu didn’t beat around the bush, and she casually spoke these words before turning around and leaving the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her clear and melodious voice was still reverberating through the hall while the expressions of everyone within the hall had become strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten days from now?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Restore the cauldron?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where did that kid get such confidence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Pojun frowned and said to Xuanyuan Tong via voice transmission, “Has A’xiu gone mad? She spoke too confidently. What if he fails? It wouldn’t just be that kid who loses face at that time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Tong shrugged and said helplessly, “It has already come to this, so let’s just give it a try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Pojun shook his head and didn’t speak any further.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he agreed to A’xiu that he would try to help, Chen Xi directly entered the world of stars. He withdrew the Violet Ribbon Starcrest and entered the assignment area before finding the assignment related to the restoration of the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he started to study it with concentration. This assignment was very difficult, otherwise, it would be impossible for all the seniors in the Pill Reserve to be helpless against it. So, Chen &nbsp;Xi didn’t dare strike his chest and guarantee he would really be able to deal with it perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he could do was ‘try his best.’ No matter if it was to help A’xiu or the earn the 800,000 Starpoints of the assignment, he would do all he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Chen Xi didn’t know that A’xiu had already spread the news that he would definitely be able to deal with the restoration of the cauldron in ten days of time…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten days in the outside world was equivalent to fifty days in the world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi concentrated on the assignment and was completely unaware of the passage of time. Unknowingly, over a month had already passed within the world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can confirm that it’s related to Divine Talismans, yet it’s even more obscure and complicated. Those that possess such ability have probably exceeded the standard of a supreme talisman formation grandmaster and can be called a Talisman God…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi muttered. Presently, he was clearly aware that above the levels of talisman formation grandmaster and supreme talisman formation grandmaster was the levels of Talisman God and Talisman Saint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First god, then saint. As the saying goes, gods and saints are inviolable. It was obvious from this method of address that Talisman Gods and Talisman Saints were extraordinarily lofty existences!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the word inviolable vividly described their status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, the Dao of Talismans followed the same principles as the Sword Dao, Blade Dao, Art Dao, Scholarly Dao. For example, when an expert in the Sword Dao attained an enlightened sword heart, it would be the level of grandmaster in the Sword Dao while a myriad of techniques emerging from a single sword technique was the supreme grandmaster level in the Sword Dao, whereas above the grandmaster and supreme grandmaster levels were the existences like Sword Gods and Sword Saints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, because the experts that were addressed as ‘god’ or ‘saint’ were too few in number within the three dimensions, the knowledge related to this sort of levels were extremely scarce within the three dimensions. It could only be described as unfathomable, supreme, and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looks like I can only rely on the might of the Infinite Divine Talisman…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering for a long time, Chen Xi finally decided to stop wasting time unnecessarily. If he had even more time, then he would naturally study the talisman formation diagrams of the cauldron with all his heart and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But unfortunately, he had too many things to deal with now, and he didn’t have enough time at all. So he naturally couldn’t waste all his time on this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the only thing Chen Xi felt was capable of dealing with this problem was probably the true inheritance of the Master of the Manor, the Infinite Divine Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a grand and strange fluctuation suddenly spread out from the world of stars with shocking impetus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned. When he turned around, he saw that at this moment, his main body’s that was seated cross-legged in meditation there had suddenly emanated a myriad of strands of divine brilliance and caused a rain of light to descend. Its entire imposing aura was like a bamboo shoot after the rain, and it suddenly rose swiftly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My main body has advanced into the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm!” Chen Xi’s eyes lit up. His clone and main body were two parts of a whole, so he was naturally able to clearly sense the various shocking changes in his main body at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath his main body’s Dantian and within the Huiyin Acupoint, a torrent of Immortal Force had shockingly converged there at this moment, and it emanated divine brilliance that was like amber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Vitality Soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, his Heavenly Soul, Earthly Soul, and Vitality Soul had been linked completely, causing the Cerebral Palace at the top of Chen Xi’s head, the Tanzhong acupoint at his chest, and the Huiyin Acupoint beneath his stomach to form a straight line that was linked together and fused together. It revealed the profound scene of the three souls fused together and profound vitality emerging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once this realm was attained, the entire body would be without the slightest shred of dirt. Thus, one’s body had truly formed into a Dao Constitution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of these were the signs of the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not bad, if I’m able to deal with the restoration of the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron, then I can allow my main body to act. In this way, my clone wouldn’t be exposed, and it continue playing the role of a trump card…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi took a deep breath and stopped thinking about this anymore before turning around and heading towards the depths of the starry sky.</span></p>
