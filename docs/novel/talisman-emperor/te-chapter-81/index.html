 <p>Chapter 81 – Tidal Dao Insight</p>
 <p><em>My current full force strike is sufficient to slaughter the Black Ape King in an instant, how could it be so easily neutralized by him? What level of cultivation technique is that black colored roiling river?</em> Chen Xi stared fixedly at the black river that whistled and surged between the Roc King’s hands. Although the river was only 70cm long, it gave a feeling that it was mighty and without end; it was extremely unbelievable.</p>
 <p>“Die!” Chen Xi refused to believe it and swung his sword out once again, Galeflash Shadow, Breezy Rain, Dark Squall, Tide Squall, Wavesplit Hurricane, and Space Shattering Typhoon, all six of the moves within the Windflow Divination Sword were executed to the limit by him, and he was confident that an attack like this was more than enough to kill even the Thunderhawk King head on.</p>
 <p>However, he still accomplished nothing!</p>
 <p>The black colored river was like a bottomless abyss that could dissolve anything, no matter how fierce and terrifying Chen Xi’s Sword Insight was. So long as it was flushed by the river water, then all the energy within it would dissipate without a trace.</p>
 <p><em>This won’t do. If this continues then even if the Roc King doesn’t take the initiative to attack, I’ll be completely worn down by this black river!</em> Chen Xi’s thoughts revolved and he didn’t continue going forward.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said it before, you aren’t a match for me.” The Roc King was calm and composed as he laughed, then a wisp of arrogance gushed out from his skinny face. “You’ve only comprehended a strand of Wind Dao Insight, whereas after experiencing 10,000 years of comprehending, I’ve instead comprehended Tidal Dao Insight, a complete Tidal Dao Insight! How could you possibly be a match for me?”</p>
 <p><em>Tidal Dao Insight? Complete?</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xi’s eyes squinted as he had a clear understanding of what that meant.</p>
 <p>Every technique was divided into the basic-stage, advanced-stage and unity stage. Once this stage was attained, one could already fuse with the world, and every move was able to draw upon the energy of heaven and earth to be used as one’s own.</p>
 <p>Above the unity-stage was the Dao Insight Stage.</p>
 <p>At this stage, one had to comprehend the world and the profundity of the Dao. So long as one’s natural endowments weren’t bad and possessed sufficient comprehension ability, then one could comprehend a Dao Insight of one’s own from all natural things like mountains, rivers, earth, flowers, plants, wind, fire, lightning, thunder, etc. Like the Wind Dao Insight Chen Xi comprehended from the wind, or the Tidal Dao Insight that the Roc King comprehended from the tide; they were all types of Dao Insight.</p>
 <p>However, there was also a difference between Dao Insights, comprehending a strand of Dao Insight could only be considered as to have only just found the path and only starting to gain mastery. If one was able to understand all the profundities of the Dao, then one could be considered to have mastered a complete Dao Insight!</p>
 <p>Chen Xi’s Wind Dao Insight could only be considered to have only just found the path, whereas the Tidal Dao Insight of the Roc King was a mastered, complete Dao Insight.</p>
 <p>Although both their cultivations in the Martial Dao were at the Dao Insight Stage, the difference between them was like the difference between the heavens and the earth!</p>
 <p>“I comprehended the Tidal Dao Insight 5,000 years ago, then experienced 5,000 more years of understanding and tempering to repeatedly improve it. Only then did I completely master a complete Tidal Dao Insight that belonged to me. This nether river in my hands was formed from the essence of water refined by my Tidal Dao Insight, and it’s able to allow me to exert the full might of the Tidal Dao Insight. The strength of its might isn’t inferior to an earth-rank Magic Treasure, and even if I encounter a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, I still have the confidence to kill him, let alone you?” The Roc King spoke with confidence and composure, and a domineering aura raged throughout his body. “Chen Xi, don’t struggle anymore, submit!”</p>
 <p>“Want me to submit? Then defeat me first!” Chen Xi grunted coldly, the eight Netherezim Flying Swords that revolved around him abruptly emitted a long cry as they transformed into eight dazzling sword lights that crisscrossed both horizontally and vertically as they moved to mince the Roc King.</p>
 <p>“Truly a stubborn little fellow. Then I’ll defeat you first!” As he sighed faintly, the Roc King’s palms suddenly grabbed towards the space before him, then fiercely pushed forward, as if he was pushing over a large mountain.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>The black river suddenly transformed into a surging turbid wave that instantly flooded the sky within an area of 50km. When gazed at from afar, it was like a vast and mighty pitch-black Great River hung beneath the sky, and it arrived before Chen Xi in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“Hmm?” Chen Xi’s face went slightly grim. Along with the appearance of the nether river, the Roc King had actually vanished into thin air! Chen Xi’s heart went cold as he summoned back the eight Netherezim Flying Swords.</p>
 <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>
 <p>Sounds of wind that were piercingly cold like blades emerged, raging like a hurricane, and every strand of wind was like a sharp sword. For a time, a myriad of sword blades slashed towards the river that assaulted straight at him, and the hurricane that contained Wind Dao Insight possessed extremely terrifying might. Even the black tide that was surging towards him was directly slashed into fine droplets before transforming into mist and vanishing.</p>
 <p>However, one wave had only just been suppressed, when a terrifying black river surged over from the distance, layer upon layer of waves flowed with it, and it was even greater in strength and impetus.</p>
 <p>“Kill!” Chen Xi didn’t hesitate in the slightest as he controlled the hurricane, and the eight Netherezim Flying Swords seemed like eight wind dragons that roared and danced wildly in the air as he moved to meet it head on,</p>
 <p>Wind Sword Insight was matchlessly fierce and swift and contained a myriad of changes. It was to break open one’s shackles and to struggle open one’s bindings; it was freedom!</p>
 <p><em>Kill!</em></p>
 <p><em>Crush the obstruction before him.</em></p>
 <p><em>Kill!</em></p>
 <p><em>Annihilate all the demons and monsters on his path.</em></p>
 <p><em>Kill!</em></p>
 <p><em>All for the sake of freedom!</em></p>
 <p>The water of the nether river roiled and surged like a tide. It seemed inexhaustible as each wave’s might was stronger and more terrifying than the last. Whereas Chen Xi instead relied on the eight Netherezim Flying Swords and his Wind Dao Insight to slaughter without restraint, like a hard stone on the precipice. <em>Despite the roiling tide, I’ll destroy it all with a myriad of swords!</em></p>
 <p>Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!</p>
 <p>The hurricane was like a sword as it crushed the tidewater into thousands of water droplets, yet was unable to completely eliminate them.</p>
 <p>“Relying solely on the eight Netherezim Flying Swords isn’t enough.” Chen Xi’s eyes were calm like icy snow as a grim light flashed within, then the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his right hand gave rise to a myriad of flickering lightning lights atop the flowing sword light condensed from his ice True Essence as he madly crushed the black waves that surged over from every direction, his imposing manner skyrocketing steadily!</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>On a small hill 5km away from Moonhowl Ridge, the azure clothed and white haired Profound-vision Old Turtle King, and the Nine-tailed Fox King who had eyes that were like peaches and hair that scattered on his shoulders, were shockingly standing atop the hill.</p>
 <p>Their gazes both looked at the black colored river below the distant sky, and the youth that was surrounded at the center of the river and waves.</p>
 <p>“What a pity!” The Old Turtle King sighed.</p>
 <p>“What’s a pity?” The Nine-tailed Fox King was stunned as he questioned.</p>
 <p>“You don’t understand.” The Old Turtle King sighed with emotion. “Not mentioning anything else, just look at this little fellow, his soul is extremely strong, and it’s more than enough to control eight top-grade yellow-rank flying swords. His comprehension ability is extremely shocking, as his cultivation in the Martial Dao is already at the Dao Insight Stage, moreover, it’s the Wind Dao Insight that’s most difficult to be comprehended. But, he still hasn’t understood the terror of the Tidal Dao Insight.”</p>
 <p>“The tide rises one after the other, and the might of each progressive wave is more formidable than the last. The might at its strongest is able to easily crush a towering mountain, and his circumstances will become more and more dangerous if he relies only on his current strength.”</p>
 <p>“If he’s given a period of time, then relying on his comprehension ability, he would be completely capable of mastering a complete Wind Dao Insight. Although his cultivation would be inferior to the Roc King, he would still be in an undefeatable position. Unfortunately, what a pity.” The Old Turtle King shook his head and sighed endlessly.</p>
 <p>“What’s there to feel pity for? If worst comes to worst, we can lend a hand and save him when he’s about to die. Didn’t you need something from him? Wouldn’t he be grateful and seek to repay us once we save him?” The Nine-tailed Fox King instead had a relaxed expression as he lightly laughed.</p>
 <p>“You don’t understand.” The Old Turtle King shook his head once more, and he said secretly in his heart. <em>Hauled into the nine layers of hell to become a dragon. If we lend a hand, then what transformation into a dragon could occur?</em></p>
 <p><em>Kill!</em></p>
 <p>The eight Netherezim Flying Swords shot out both horizontally and vertically, Chen Xi held the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand as he took step by step forward, and numerous black colored enormous waves were crushed into droplets before vanishing.</p>
 <p><em>The strength of the waves are growing stronger, and it’s becoming more strenuous for me.</em> Chen Xi was extremely anxious in his heart. <em>Moreover, my True Essence is being consumed bit by bit. If this goes on, then I’m afraid my circumstances will become extremely terrible.</em></p>
 <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>
 <p>Another black colored tidal wave surged over with an aura even stronger and fiercer than the previous wave, and there was even the sharp aura of halberds vaguely carried within it.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>When Chen Xi annihilated the first wave of tidal waves with his Seventhgold Swordbamboo yet saw it was unable to make the tidal waves die out, he clenched his left fist right away, then punch after punch tore through the sky towards the tidal wave. The fist lights seemed material, containing the strength of Chen Xi’s body that was at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm and a trace of indistinct and mysterious Shaman Energy as they roared out, thoroughly blasting the waves that had transformed into droplets to scatter and disappear completely.</p>
 <p><em>Kill!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xi could only desperately fight on when surrounded by the nether river from all directions.</p>
 <p>“He’s going to lose.” The Nine-tailed Fox King said unhurriedly, “He even used his body refinement cultivation that’s only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, and he’s undoubtedly making his last struggle. Should we save him?”</p>
 <p>The Old Turtle King shook his head. “It’s still a bit too early. Wait a while longer. He can still persist for some time.”</p>
 <p>“You still want to wait?” The Nine-tailed Fox King said in surprise, “If we wait any longer, then even if we rescue him, he’d probably have suffered an extremely heavy injury and become a complete cripple whose life is over.”</p>
 <p>“Wait.” The Old Turtle King still persisted, and the gaze he looked at Chen Xi with seemed to vaguely be anticipating something.</p>
 <p>Slap!</p>
 <p>The time of making another cup of tea had passed, when Chen Xi was fighting with his utmost strength, a black tidal wave was like an enormous hammer that slammed down fiercely onto Chen Xi’s body, and he was directly thrown flying over 30m away and a strand of dark red fresh blood appeared on the corners of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Kill!” Chen Xi’s hair was disheveled and he didn’t care about the blood that flowed out from the corners of his mouth. The instant his body fell from the impact, he’d scurried back up right away, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand moved straight out to annihilate the black colored tidal wave that once again approached in assault.</p>
 <p><em>Kill! Kill! Kill!</em></p>
 <p>His body was already extremely exhausted, his True Essence almost consumed completely, yet a ball of surging flames blazed within Chen Xi’s eyes. That was the flames of unyieldingness, persistence, and stubbornness!</p>
 <p>The time for making another cup of tea passed.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi’s expression was already completely lifeless, as if he’d fallen into possession by a devil, and his gaze was blank. If it wasn’t for the eight Netherezim Flying Swords that danced about around him and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand stabbing out, his current appearance was simply like a wooden puppet that had lost its soul!</p>
 <p>Countless scenes slipped past Chen Xi’s mind, like floating lights and passing shadows, yet they were so clear.</p>
 <p>His impoverished life when he was young, his mother missing, his father leaving, his marriage contract being torn apart, the unending humiliation and ridicule, his grandfather’s gaze of resentment and dejection…</p>
 <p>The countless scenes fused together, transforming into a large hand that tightly choked his throat.</p>
 <p>He felt out of breath as the strong feeling of suffocation filled his entire body, as if he was a little insect that was enveloped by the web of a spider, unable to struggle, and could only wait for death.</p>
 <p><em>Why?!</em></p>
 <p><em>Why?!</em></p>
 <p>He shouted at the top of his voice, roaring with rage and unwillingness.</p>
