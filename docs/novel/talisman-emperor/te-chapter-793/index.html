 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, everyone within the estate noticed the unusualness within the Prime Blood God Flags.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems…as if the Prime Blood God Flags have become weaker again?” Someone was surprised and bewildered because he acutely noticed that compared from before, the strength of the Prime Blood God Flags had simply weakened by more than 10 times!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The will of that great figure has vanished!” Earthly Immortal Realm experts like Wen Tianshuo, Qing Ping, Hui Zhong, Lou Qi, and the others very clearly determined the changes within it, and all of them were extremely horrified.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that all of this was done by that young man?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t.” The old servant shook his head and frowned. “A force capable of forcing the will of a great figure back is truly impossible to be determined. Unless…Chen Xi carries an extremely terrifying secret treasure in his possession.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. No matter how heaven defying his strength is, he’s restrained by his cultivation, and it’s utterly insufficient to go against the will of a great figure. Based on this inference, he surely possesses an extraordinary treasure.” The other old servant pondered briefly before he spoke as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An extraordinary secret treasure?” Baili Yan was shocked in her heart, and then she muttered. “Could it be the ultimate treasure of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, the Chaotic Magic Sword? Impossible! That’s the great weapon of slaughter that only the Sect Master of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect can possess, and it holds down the karmic luck of the entire sect. How could it possibly be passed down to be used by Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of dazzling sword qi that seemed capable of reaching the heavens surged out with a bang, and it shot into the sky and surged through the surroundings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, under the astounded gazes of everyone, a tall figure stepped out from within the shattered Prime Blood God Flags, and his clothes fluttered with the wind while he revealed a gaze that was like bolts of lightning. It was Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, as they looked at this figure, everyone was shocked speechless, and the atmosphere was perfectly silent.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You… You…” Compared to the shock of the others, Priest Zi Yun was shocked out of his wits, and his face was covered in deep disbelief and terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He simply seemed as if he’d seen a ghost.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of Creation Sword Qi flashed. The head of Priest Zi Yun who hadn’t awakened from his shock was chopped off directly, causing fresh blood to spray out as he perished. He couldn’t figure out exactly how this young man before him had accomplished all this no matter how he wracked his brains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, eight Earthly Immortal Realm experts and great sinners that were ranked in the top 100 of the Villain Rankings had been completely wiped out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person that accomplished this was merely Chen Xi alone!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone believed that if news of this battle were to spread, the entire Dark Reverie would fall into extremely great shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle had ended, and the sky was still suffused with a dense and pungent smell of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t become free. He executed his techniques to completely wipe out the energy of sin here, and then he swept out with his sleeve, causing all the broken pieces of the Prime Blood God Flags to be put away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After completing all this, Chen Xi put the sword away and descended back to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd seemed to tacitly and automatically open up a path for Chen Xi to tread on. The faces of every single one of them was covered in deep reverence that came from the heart, and they seemed to be welcoming a king respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them were clearly aware that if it wasn’t for Chen Xi, then they would have probably died a long time ago, and they would utterly be incapable of safely surviving until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing embarrassing about admitting this. After all, it was eight great sinners at the Earthly Immortal Realm! It was even to the extent that there was no need for all of them to make a move before they could crush every here like ants!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the reverence and gratitude they felt towards Chen Xi was absolutely from the heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s all thanks to Young Hero Chen’s life saving grace that everyone within my estate was able to survive this calamity. Please accept my gratitude.” Wen Tianshuo took a large stride forward with a serious expression, and then he bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Young Hero Chen, for your life saving grace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter their cultivations, everyone bowed deeply in unison when they saw this because such a great kindness of saving their lives was worthy of them treating him in such a way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those cultivators that had lashed out at Chen Xi earlier even revealed embarrassed expressions, and they were extremely anxious, causing the degree of their bows to be much greater than the others. Moreover, they wished for nothing more than to bury their heads into the ground in order to seek the slightest forgiveness from Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, it’s fine. I was just lucky enough to be here at the right time.” Chen Xi raised his hands slightly when he saw this, causing a gentle and shapeless force to surge out and help up the bowed figures of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Hero Chen, you’re too modest. I’m unable to repay such a life saving grace as well. If Young Hero Chen doesn’t mind, then I’m willing to use the treasure map in my possession as an invite, and I hope that you’ll head to the Sky Dao Abandoned Mountain with me in the future to carry out this important matter!” Wen Tianshuo spoke with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll discuss this matter later. I just want to have a good rest now.” Chen Xi changed the topic of conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, of course.” When he saw Chen Xi didn’t refuse directly, Wen Tianshuo instructed right away. “Quickly prepare the best room for Young Hero Chen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he glanced at the nearby Wen Hua in an imperceptible manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump!</span></p>

I admire Senior extremely, and I earnestly request that Senior takes me as a disciple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi glanced at the young man on the ground with a calm expression, and not the slightest fluctuation could be seen on his face before he walked away. From the beginning until the end, he didn’t speak a single word, nor did he make his stand clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned when they saw this scene, and some of them were unable to figure out what was going on. According to their thoughts, Chen Xi was entirely able to smoothly take Wen Hua as a disciple at this moment. After all, this little fellow was born with the Goldstar Body and extraordinary natural talent. Coupled with Marquis Wen being willing to share the treasure map with Chen Xi, taking Wen Hua as his disciple could be considered to satisfy both parties, so why not?</span></p>

So they could only bury this bewilderment in their hearts.</span></p>

He’d been disregarded by Chen Xi in front of so many people, causing him to feel extremely embarrassed, and a wisp of indignation flashed inadvertently in the depths of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Tianshuo had similarly not expected that Chen Xi’s attitude would be so cold and indifferent, and his expression stiffened slightly before recovering to normal, then he patted the shoulder of his son as he smiled. “Oh you, you’re too eager to acknowledge him as your master. Young Hero Chen just experienced a great battle, and he’s tired and exhausted, so how could he have the mood to pay attention to you? Quickly get up. It isn’t too late to pay a visit to Young Hero Chen after he rests.”</span></p>

But his expression was slightly depressed as he couldn’t figure out why Chen Xi would be so cold and indifferent to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, everyone within the estate dispersed because witnessing the shocking battle from before had caused their minds to be worn to the extreme, and all of them felt slightly exhausted.</span></p>

Most importantly, they wanted to investigate the identity of that young man!</span></p>

Eight great sinners had been annihilated by him alone, and such a heaven defying and monstrous figure had to be clearly ascertained.</span></p>

The matter was related to everything possessed by the Sky Dao Palace, so they had no choice but to attach great importance to it.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Baili Yan met Chen Xi once more before she left. On the contrary to how she usually acted, she didn’t continue pursuing the question of how Chen Xi had comprehended and grasped the Eternal profundity. She seemed to know as well that no matter how she questioned Chen Xi, Chen Xi wouldn’t give her a clear answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She only chatted with Chen Xi about some topics of no importance like the upheaval of the three dimensions, the Xeno-race, and various other situations in the world. When she left in the end, she even cordially invited Chen Xi to drop in at the Eternal Spirit Mountain when he was free.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi naturally knew that this was because Baili Yan was helpless against him, and since she knew very well that she was unable to do anything to him, she intended to form goodwill with him and win him over.</span></p>

Chen Xi had once said that killing Priest Zi Yun and the others was for the sake of completing an assignment of his sect, and it just happened that many great powers had obtained the news that the Nine Radiance Sword Sect’s disciple, Chen Xi, had just recently been promoted to an elder. Now, he’d left the sect to complete the two assignments of ‘passing down the flames’ and ‘enforcing justice on behalf of the heavens.’</span></p>
