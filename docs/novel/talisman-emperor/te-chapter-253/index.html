 <p>Chapter 253 – Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan</p>
 <p>Bei Heng heaved a sigh of relief in his heart as Huangfu Jingtian’s reaction sufficiently proved that this command token had an extremely great effect. Otherwise, this old fellow, Huangfu Jingtian, would absolutely not reveal such a shocked expression.</p>
 <p>All that was left was to see how this old fellow would choose.</p>
 <p>When they saw Huangfu Jingtian keeping silent as he held the command token, Mo Lanhai and the others couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. <i>Isn’t it only a command token? Even if it’s the Ninedragon Command Token issued by the current Emperor Chu, what can it do to us?</i></p>
 <p>But even though they thought like this, they knew the way Huangfu Jingtian behaved, and they knew that this old fellow had always been extremely overbearing. Even if he was facing the current Emperor Chu, he’d never revealed such a serious expression, yet at this moment, he was instead driven to silence by a command token. <i>Could it be that there’s something extraordinary about this command token?</i><i></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>All of them withdrew their arrogant expressions as they looked towards the command token.</p>
 <p>“A command token with a ‘白’ character atop it?”</p>
 <p>“Bai Clan, which Bai Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Could it be the Violet Thistle Bai Clan that stood above the Dark Reverie and dominated an area?”</p>
 <p>Violet Thistle was the name of a boundlessly vast mountain range in the Dark Reverie, and it was even the territory occupied by one of the overlords of the Dark Reverie, the Bai Clan. Thus, the name Violet Thistle Bai Clan came from this.</p>
 <p>At the instant everyone saw the ‘白’ character on the command token, their expressions abruptly turned to one of shock just like Huangfu Jingtian, and some terrifying information instantly appeared within their minds.</p>
 <p>“All of you have noticed as well? Exactly. This command token is precisely the command token of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan. I’ve once seen one in the possession of the Imperial Brother, and it isn’t the slightest bit different.” Huangfu Jingtian spoke with a low voice, and his voice revealed a trace of deep fear and shock.</p>
 <p>Hiss!</p>
 <p>After they obtained Huangfu Jingtian’s confirmation, everyone gasped in their hearts. <i>With the Bai Clan’s command token in his possession, wouldn’t that mean that this old fellow, Bei Heng, has an intimate relationship with the Violet Thistle Bai Clan?</i></p>
 <p>This wasn’t an exaggerated reaction. Only a person with a deeper understanding of the Dark Reverie would more clearly understand how formidable that boundless continent was, whereas, since the Bai Clan was capable of dominating an area of the Dark Reverie and be an overlord that stood firm, it was sufficient to show how terrifying the power of the Bai Clan was.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! I never imagined that you, Bei Heng, are actually connected to the Violet Thistle Bai Clan. No wonder you talk so big.” Huangfu Jingtian took a deep breath as he spoke coldly, yet compared with his domineering attitude from before, his present attitude had obviously eased up greatly.</p>
 <p>Bei Heng smiled slightly yet remained silent. Being able to see these old freaks be shocked and lose their composure was an exceedingly rare sight, and he enjoyed this feeling extremely, even if all of this was merely because of that command token.</p>
 <p>Just think about it, even the current Emperor Chu had the door closed in his face when he wanted to visit the Bai Clan, and how terrifying the power of the Bai Clan was could be seen from this. Even though everyone present was an Earthly Immortal Realm expert, and they usually swept through the world and looked down upon everyone. But in terms of status, they were inferior to Emperor Chu, yet even Emperor Chu’s visit was refused, let alone them. It wasn’t the slightest bit exaggerated to say that they didn’t even have the chance to be refused by the Violet Thistle Bai Clan!</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Under these circumstances, I won’t beat around the bush with you. Even though you, Bei Heng, possess a command token of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan, yet it’s unrelated to your sworn brother. Even if we kill him, what can the Violet Thistle Bai Clan do? They wouldn’t go to the extent of condemning us for the sake of a little fellow that’s utterly unrelated to them, right?”</p>
 <p>Huangfu Jingtian could help but be enraged in his heart when he saw Bei Heng having such an arrogant attitude, yet he feared the Violet Thistle Bai Clan behind Bei Heng, so he didn’t speak any extreme words and only locked his target onto Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“Exactly. Since Fellow Daoist Bei Heng has the protection of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan, we’ll naturally not easily offend you. But Chen Xi is only the sworn brother of you, Bei Heng, and he’s completely unrelated to the Violet Thistle Bai Clan. The Bai Clan utterly couldn’t be bothered to care if we killed him, right?” Mo Lanhai sneered as well.</p>
 <p>The others heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts when they heard this. <i>Right, Bei Heng is Bei Heng, and Chen Xi is Chen Xi. Why would the Violet Thistle Bai Clan move out for a tiny ant?</i></p>
 <p>“A grievous mistake! All of you...have really become more muddled the more you live!” Bei Heng criticized without the slightest vagueness, and his appearance seemed as if he was reprimanding his own juniors passionately without holding back in the slightest.</p>
 <p>But he was enjoying himself, yet the expressions of the others sank and they glared angrily at him. Even though they were afraid of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan, but their dignity as Earthly Immortal Realm experts couldn’t be violated, and Bei Heng’s words had undoubtedly challenged their bottom line.</p>
 <p>Bei Heng didn’t dare completely offend these old freaks as well. It was fine if he enjoyed himself, yet if he offended these old freaks to the point of disregarding everything and attacking him, then it wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
 <p>When he thought up to here, Bei Heng sighed deeply. “Fellow Daoist, don’t blame me for speaking offensively. To tell all of you honestly, if it wasn’t for that sworn brother of mine, I’d be utterly unable to obtain this command token.”</p>
 <p>Instantly, the expressions of everyone couldn’t help but go serious.</p>
 <p>“You said that a member of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan bestowed this command token to you because of that kid?” Huangfu Jingtian couldn’t restrain the shock in his heart and cried out involuntarily.</p>
 <p>Bei Heng shrugged and said helplessly, “With my status, does everyone think I would be willing to admit to a thing like this?”</p>
 <p>Everyone went silent. They’d already completely believed Bei Heng’s words. If it was them, they wouldn’t easily speak of this as well. After all, it was indeed shameful to speak of how one had obtained the favor of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan because of a junior.</p>
 <p>“Impossible! The Violet Thistle Bai Clan possesses such great status that even my Imperial Brother is unable to pay a visit to them. How could a little fellow at the Golden Hall Realm possibly receive the favor of the Violet Thistle Bai Clan?” Huangfu Jingtian was still unwilling to believe it, and he shook his head as he spoke, yet the depths of his heart had already started to be shaken.</p>
 <p>Bei Heng sighed in his heart. Not to mention Huangfu Jingtian, even he, the sworn brother of Chen Xi utterly did not dare believe that Chen Xi was actually related to the Violet Thistle Bai Clan before he saw Bai Wanqing’s ability.</p>
 <p>“Forget it. We won’t pursue this matter anymore. But Fellow Daoist Bei Heng, the treasures seized from our sect’s disciples ought to be returned in the end, right?” Mo Lanhai frowned as he sighed.</p>
 <p>The matter developing to such an extent was something that none of them had ever imagined. In the beginning, dealing with a little fellow at the Golden Hall Realm was an extremely easy thing, and it was even to the extent that they felt they were bullying the weak. How could they have imagined that Chen Xi possessed such strong backing?</p>
 <p>If they had known earlier, they wouldn’t have come over no matter what.</p>
 <p>Yet now, they’d come over with murderous airs, but not only did they not capture Chen Xi, they didn’t even reclaim a single treasure. In the end, they were instead struck with a warning bell that caused all their plans to fall through. Thus the grievance, sense of loss, and helplessness in their hearts was easily imaginable.</p>
 <p>“We can only do this. Fellow Daoist Bei Heng, we’ve made a concession already, so you ought to agree to this little condition, right?”</p>
 <p>“So long as that kid is willing to hand over the treasures he seized and return them to our sect’s disciples, then this matter will be written off and all enmity will be cleared, and we’ll leave each other alone. How about it?”</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist Bei Heng, make your attitude towards this matter clear. We’re all members of the Darchu Dynasty’s cultivation world and don’t belong to the Dark Reverie, so we’ll be meeting each other regularly. I hope you can think over this.”</p>
 <p>All of these old freaks were wise and experienced, so when they knew the situation was beyond recovery, they decided resolutely to take a step back and seek the second best, and they put forward a request that carried dense helplessness.</p>
 <p>Doing this wasn’t merely for the sake of retrieving some face, but it was because they couldn’t come over with murderous airs yet leave with their tails between their legs, right?”</p>
 <p>Bei Heng was greatly pleased in his heart when he saw this scene. Even though he was slightly borrowing the powers of others to masquerade around, but being able to see so many renowned Earthly Immortal Realm old freaks suffering defeat in unison was a matter worthy of delight. If it wasn’t for the situation being unsuitable, he would have started laughing heartily long ago and drink a cup of strong wine to celebrate his feelings at this moment.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he thought even more about how good Chen Xi was. He felt that becoming sworn brothers with Chen Xi was absolutely the wisest thing he’d done in his entire lifetime.</p>
 <p>Bei Heng pretended to be pondering before shaking his head and saying resolutely after some time, “I can’t agree to it because I and Chen Xi have a relationship as if two of the same generations. It’s impossible for me to make a decision for him.”</p>
 <p>The expressions of everyone including Huangfu Jingtian darkened to the point it was akin to the bottom of a pot when they heard this. <i>This old fellow isn’t even giving us the chance to reclaim our dignity? He’s simply going too far! </i></p>
 <p>“Everyone, I’ve always felt that this is a matter between juniors, and it of course should be dealt with by juniors. Aren’t we pampering them too much by interfering in it? This isn’t beneficial for their cultivation!” Bei Heng instead seemed to have not noticed the expressions of everyone, and he sighed while offering advice.</p>
 <p><i>Ptooey!</i></p>
 <p><i>You hypocritical old thing!</i></p>
 <p><i>The Heavenly Tribulation will surely blast you to death one day!</i></p>
 <p>Everyone was angered to the point they almost spat blood. All of them had lived for a few thousands of years, yet they were advised by Bei Heng with a lecturing appearance, so how could they endure it in their hearts?</p>
 <p>But since the matter had played out like this, and Bei Heng’s attitude was extremely firm, they could only leave with hatred in their hearts. As for seizing the treasures in Chen Xi’s possession? What a joke! Unless they were tired of living!</p>
 <p>They left silently without alarming anyone in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, yet there was a ball of blazing flames of rage in their hearts, and a variety of grievance, resentment, and sense of loss almost tortured them to madness.</p>
 <p>As experts at the Earthly Immortal Realm, when had they suffered such humiliation?</p>
 <p><i>These bastards just had to offend such a freak. They’ve simply pushed us into a pit of flames! We must teach these bastards a fierce lesson once we return… </i>Huangfu Jingtian and the others flashed swiftly towards different directions, yet the same thought gushed out in their hearts. It was the thought of fiercely teaching a lesson to those bastard disciples that hadn’t even found out clearly about their enemy’s circumstances before sending them to go lose face!</p>
 <p>If they didn’t do this, it wouldn’t be enough to vent the hatred in their hearts!</p>
 <p>“Whoosh~” Within the Audience Hall of the main peak of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, Bei Heng carefully placed the Bai Clan command token into his storage Magic Treasure, and then he heaved a long sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but feel a wave of fear in his heart when he recalled everything he encountered earlier. <i>If I didn’t possess a Bai Clan command token today, then I’d probably be unable to turn around everything that happened today, right?</i></p>
 <p><i>This won't do! I have to personally make a trip to Pine Mist City, otherwise, I’d be too useless an older brother… </i>Bei Heng pondered silently for a long time before stepping out of the audience hall right away.</p>
 <p>“Grand Ancestor, how was the matter dealt with?” Ling Kongzi had always been guarding outside the audience hall. Even though he didn’t hear everything that happened within the audience hall, yet he’d seen Huangfu Jingtian and the other’s leave with his own two eyes, so when he saw Bei Heng come out now, he hurriedly moved over to greet Bei Heng.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Didn’t you see them leaving dejectedly?” When this matter was mentioned, Bei Heng recalled the appearances of those old fellows when they suffered a defeat, and he couldn’t refrain from looking up into the sky and bursting into laughter.</p>
 <p>Ling Kongzi was shocked greatly, and he stared blankly at his Grand Ancestor Bei Heng whose laughter revealed boundless pleasure as he said, “In other words, Chen Xi’s life isn’t in danger anymore?”</p>
 <p>Bei Heng nodded and instructed. “Tell the others not to blab about this arbitrarily. Right, properly renovate True Heart Peak for me and send over anything that’s lacking. Besides that, the treatment of the disciples of True Heart Peak must be raised. Even if that sworn brother of mine doesn’t return, I must keep this peak nicely for him!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Bei Heng stepped up into the sky and vanished in the boundless horizon in an instant.</p>
 <p><i>Looks like Grand Ancestor occupied an advantageous position in this dispute! </i>Ling Kongzi muttered endlessly, and an unprecedented feeling of excitement arose within his heart. <i>From this day onwards, who would dare offend my Wanderingcloud Sword Sect that suppressed six Earthly Immortal Realm experts? </i></p>
