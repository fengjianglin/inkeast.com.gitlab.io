 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Molei was covered in injuries and had obviously suffered an extremely great injury. His cultivation had even been sealed, causing him to simply be weaker than an ordinary person while in this state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little… Little Junior Brother.” Huo Molei spoke weakly with a dry and hoarse voice. He felt both pleasantly surprised and disbelief when he saw Chen Xi earlier, and up until this moment, he finally dared believe that everything was real, causing warm tears to flow down from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was truly difficult to imagine what sort of torment had a cheerful man like this suffered to become so excited and sorrowful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt a lump in his throat and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, rest at ease. I’ll take revenge for you!” As he finished speaking, his voice seemed as if it was squeezed out from the cracks between his teeth, and it was icy cold and murderous to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this voice entered into Huo Molei’s ears, it was so calm and gentle, and it caused him to instantly become relaxed and actually unknowingly fall into deep sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi carried his Eldest Senior Brother on his back while moving step by step towards Tao Kun with an indifferent expression. He was like an unsheathed sharp sword, and the killing intent emanated from him would rise explosively with every stride he took. Up until the end, his entire surroundings surged with expanses of pitch black talisman markings that caused him to seem like a god of devils that had walked out from the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tao Kun was still howling while kneeling on the ground and unable to struggle free. His expression was warped and livid because kneeling on the street in public caused him to feel unprecedented humiliation, causing him to be on the verge of madness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The genius of the Taotie Clan, the eldest son of the Second Elder Tao Mo, and a Core Disciple of the Heavenflow Dao Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he’d actually been suppressed to the point of kneeling on the ground. When had he ever experienced such humiliation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You clearly knew his identity yet still dared to confine and torment him. This crime deserves death!” A flat and indifferent voice sounded out by his ears, causing Tao Kun who was overwhelmed with rage to tremble, and he seemed as if he’d been splashed with a pail of cold water, causing his entire body to shiver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…actually want to kill me within the territory of my clan?” Tao Kun revealed a terrified expression that was filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you think?” Chen Xi replied with an icy cold tone, and then he raised his hand seeming to intent to annihilate Tao Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at this moment, an explosive shout that was filled with dignity sounded out abruptly from the distant sky. “Stay your hand!” The voice was like a thunderclap that resounded out in the surroundings and shook the eardrums of all to the point of droning and aching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This voice had just resounded out when a tall figure tore through space, and then pushed away Chen Xi’s descending palm with a flick of his sleeve, easily assisting Tao Kun in dealing with this lethal strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes focused as he took a few steps back before standing still and looking over, and he saw a tall and dignified middle aged man stood before Tao Kun. The middle aged man wore a fiery red robe, had a firm appearance, and his eyes were deep like an ocean and rather awe-inspiring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Patriarch!” Tao Kun almost cried from his overjoyed feelings of escaping death, and he cried out repeatedly. “Patriarch, quickly, quickly kill this fellow. He actually dared to kill in the territory of our Taotie Clan! He’s simply mad and lawless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed. Only now did he know that the dignified middle aged man was the Patriarch of the Taotie Clan, Tao Zhentian, an Earthly Immortal Realm expert that had overcome the seventh level of the heavenly tribulations!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, another 10 plus figures arrived here. Every single one of them were seniors of the Taotie Clan with formidable auras, and their bodies were coiled with Immortal Energy. Merely the monstrous imposing auras on their bodies caused the hearts of others to palpitate without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he’d never really intended to kill Tao Kun since the beginning. After all, this was Taotie City, the territory of the Taotie Clan, and he wanted to participate in the Spirit Chef Gold Rankings to fulfil the wishes of Old Man Ma and Master Yong. So no matter how furious he was, he had no choice but to forcefully restrain his rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he felt that it was utterly impossible for someone like Tao Kun do dare make a move against his Eldest Senior Brother, and this fellow was an accomplice at most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was very simple. No matter how inferior Huo Molei’s cultivation was, he was a disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in the end, so no matter how bold Tao Kun was, he had to consider the consequences of offending the Nine Radiance Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kun’er! How did this happen to you? Who did this to you!?” A middle aged man with a gloomy expression noticed Tao Kun’s miserable appearance and couldn’t help but be filled with rage as he shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was Tao Kun’s father, Tao Luxiao, and he was the second elder of the Taotie Clan, causing him to possess monstrous authority. As he spoke, he swept his ghastly, icy cold, and murderous gaze at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, you’ve come as well.” Tao Kun’s face was covered in shame, and then it turned savage as he pointed at Chen Xi. “Father, kill him. You must not allow him to escape today, otherwise, there’ll be a great calamity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, there was no need for Tao Kun to point out as Tao Zhentian and the others had already shot their gazes at Chen Xi. All their gazes were filled with rage because a young man actually dared to be so presumptuous in Taotie City, and merely this was sufficient reason for them to annihilate him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged as he looked indifferently at the Earthly Immortal Realm experts with monstrous imposing auras before him. He didn’t feel the slightest nervousness or fear. Conversely, his gaze was icy cold and calm. “Everyone, aren’t all of you going to ask what sort of monstrous deed this scum of your clan has committed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tao Zhentian and the other Earthly Immortal Realm experts frowned as they sensed a trace of unusualness in this matter because the young man before them was too composed as if he had something to rely on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tao Kun’s expression went grim, and he shouted explosively and urgently. “Father, quickly, he can’t be aloud to continue speaking. I’ll explain everything to you and the elders after he’s killed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? You intend to kill me to keep me silent?” Chen Xi sneered, yet an unexpected event occurred before he could say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tao Luxiao had actually made a move directly and utterly didn’t give him the chance to speak. Tao Luxiao’s figure flashed as his fingers tore through space like sharp claws and fiercely grabbed down at Chen Xi’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attack was too sudden, and it was simply swift like a bolt of lightning and completely revealed the strength of an Earthly Immortal Realm cultivator. If Chen Xi were to be grabbed by it, then he would die for sure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi was prepared since the beginning, his heart still went cold when facing this strike, and his hairs stood on end. His True Essence rumbled as he didn’t hesitate in the slightest and intended to execute the Wings of Disruption to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at this moment, a wisp of dazzling starlight seemed as if it had appeared out of thin air and swiftly lay across the area before Chen Xi, and it waved with brilliant waves of light, causing it to seem like an extremely beautiful silver colored ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tao Luxiao’s grab was extremely terrifying and capable of overturning an ocean or crushing both Yin and Yang. But, when this strike hit the starlight, it only caused a string of blazing sparks yet was unable to shake it in the slightest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this, and for the very first time, he felt gratitude towards this candid young woman.</span></p>
