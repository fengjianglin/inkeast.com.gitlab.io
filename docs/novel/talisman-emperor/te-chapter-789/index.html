 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Priest Zi Yun’s expression had turned gloomy. “I’m unworthy of speaking about fortune with you? Very good, it’s truly slightly a surprise to me that you possess such courage at such a young age.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, he looked down and swept his gaze past everyone in the estate and said, “Everyone, I advise all of you to be obedient and don’t move, and perhaps you’ll have a chance at survival. Otherwise, I can only send all of you on your way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone shuddered with fear while they revealed struggling and indeterminate expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially Wen Tianshuo, Qing Ping, Hui Zhong, and Lou Qi, they were struggling intensely within their hearts. Truthfully speaking, if it was before Priest Zi Yun and the others had arrived, they would absolutely not hesitate to make a move and help Chen Xi annihilate Huai Ming and Bei Huang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now… They were hesitant.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, it seemed to be impossible for Chen Xi to be as bold and powerful as he was before while alone. After all, his opponents were five Earthly Immortal Realm experts whose hands were covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances, how could Wen Tianshuo and the others struggle?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even ants clung on to life, let alone existences like them that had lives for countless years. The older one got, the more one would treasure one’s life, so they couldn’t be blamed for being so troubled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I forgot to tell you something. I left the sect to wander the world because I had to complete an assignment of my sect, and I must kill 10 great sinners. I just counted, and if I kill all of you, I would still lack two more. It’s truly a pity.” Chen Xi’s green clothes fluttered within the wind while he seemed more and more fierce, and he was like an emperor of the sword as two cold bolts of lightning shot out from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An assignment of his sect?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he’d killed three Earthly Immortal Realm experts with ease just moments ago, and it seemed to be impossible for a single young man like this to appear in the 10 great immortal sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Priest Zi Yun smiled lightly. As an overlord amongst evil cultivators who’d slaughtered countless people, how could he be affected by a few words from Chen Xi? So he said right away, “Since you’re looking for death, then you can’t blame me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, he flicked his violet colored sleeve, causing five blood colored tiny flags to fly out before swiftly enlarging. Instantly, they transformed into 30km tall blood red flags that fluttered with the wind, and they were like a screen that covered the heavens and painted the heavens and the earth blood red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kill!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These five blood red flags seemed as if they were pulled up from an ocean of blood. Their surface was covered in fresh blood that seemed ready to drip out and had countless strange and ghastly restrictions drawn upon them. At the instant they appeared, they emanated waves of miserable and shrill cries that shook the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless evil and vengeful spirits were visibly floating and sinking within the blood red flags, and they were roaring with rage, causing everyone to have the misconception that they’d entered into a hell of evil spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish! Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five blood red flags that covered the sky transformed into five bloody glows that were inserted into the surroundings of Marquis Wen’s Estate according to the positioning of the five elements, and they cooperated with each other from a distance to completely seal up this expanse of space. It was utterly impossible to see anything that was occurring within the estate from the outside, whereas everyone within the estate was similarly incapable of establishing any connection with the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such an ability simply seemed like it had forcefully separated and sealed off this expanse of space, and it was practically godlike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone wanted to take a step back as they were afraid of being swept into it. However, all of them noticed to their shock that the entire estate had actually been confined, while they weren’t able to move at all as if they’d fallen into a swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit! Why can’t I move?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! My body has been confined as well. I can’t even circulate my True Essence!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was horrified, and then they looked at the five blood red flags that covered the sky because they understood that it was surely caused by this terrifying magic treasure that emanated a surging bloody glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This set of magic treasures was too terrifying, and it was no wonder that Priest Zi Yun was unafraid because this was absolutely a great and astonishing weapon capable of confining space and locking down everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, there’s no need for panic. So long as you stay there obediently, then I’ll surely leave all of you a chance at survival.” Priest Zi Yun spoke slowly with an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a sort of deterrent force, and it was similarly a type of conceit as well because a single set of magic treasures were capable of sealing off the heavens and the earth and causing all the cultivators within the magic treasure’s scope of effect to suffer varying degrees of suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them were horrified, anxious, and uneasy. Some were even trembling and were terrified to the point of collapsing onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wen Tianshuo, Qing Ping, Hui Zhong, and the few other Earthly Immortal Realm experts felt a wave of fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, I didn’t charge out impatiently earlier. This Priest Zi Yun is too terrifying. The resources and reserves of an old fellow that has lived for over 10,000 years is truly extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of if it was Baili Yan or the two old servants behind her, all of their expressions were extremely heavy. They were similarly within the area that was enveloped, so they were naturally able to sense the terrifying might emanated by the five blood red flags.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoists Huai Ming, Bei Huang, Chi Ya, and Huang Jiao, each of you take charge of a Prime Blood God Flag and completely seal off this place.” Priest Zi Yun instructed with an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huai Ming and the others smiled cruelly before transforming into four bloody streaks of lights that went to carry out their orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Prime Blood God Flags! Sure enough, it’s this precious treasure of evil.” Baili Yan spoke while a wisp of shock suffused her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Those are Prime Blood God Flags? The flag said to have been possessed by Ancestor Blood River in the Netherworld during the primeval times? The flag that’s capable of annihilating the five elements, dying the three dimensions with blood, and instantly transforming a myriad of living beings into vengeful spirits!?” Many people were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reputation of the Prime Blood God Flag was too great. It had once revealed extraordinary splendor during the primeval times and created a reputation for itself through slaughter, and it had killed countless great figures that shook the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Supposedly, this Prime Blood God Flag was refined from the soul of a god within the longest river of blood in the Netherworld, and it formed a world of its own called the ‘Blood River World’ within it. It was a great weapon of slaughter that had shocked the primeval times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many legends about this precious treasure of evil. All those years ago, Ancestor Blood River possessed it, and he almost conquered the six paths of reincarnation in the Netherworld and took control of the entire Netherworld. He was only a step away from becoming the ruler of a world.</span></p>

This is probably a copy, and it can only exert the might of an Immortal Artifact when there are five flags executed jointly.” One of the old servants behind Baili Yan spoke in a low voice.</span></p>

The five Prime Blood God Flags suppressed the surroundings and ceaselessly emanated a fluctuation that caused him to feel heavy pressure, and it was like he’d fallen into a cage and couldn’t struggle his way out.</span></p>

In next to no time, his expression returned to normal, but the corners of his mouth flashed with a strange expression.</span></p>

After all, he’d exhausted a few thousands of years to gather an innumerable amount of blood and souls to forge this precious treasure. Even though it was a copy, its might was even more formidable than an ordinary Immortal Artifact, and it was comparable with a Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact!</span></p>

Thank you, Big Brother Zi Yun, for helping me achieve my wish!” Huai Ming roared with laughter as he walked out with large strides, and his eyes emanated dense killing intent. “Little Kid, let me fucking see how you’ll complete that bullshit assignment of your sect once you’re dead!”</span></p>

The Light of Eradication! Such a supreme Divine Ability that’s ranked in the top 30 of the Divine Ability Gold Rankings of the three dimensions has actually been grasped by a little kid like you!?” Huai Ming was shocked, and then he laughed savagely. “Unfortunately, you haven’t cultivated it to a high level, and your strength is too weak. Such a Divine Ability falling into your hands is simply a waste of god’s give gifts, so how could it injure me?”</span></p>
