 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Moreover, his expression turned savage while he couldn’t refrain from roaring repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how he struggled, it was of no use because his knees were crushed by the oppressive force, and he directly kneeled before Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He kneeled!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mei Qingyuan was overbearing, arrogant, and haughty because he was a descendant of a great figure from the Immortal Dimension. Now, he was suppressed to the point of kneeling instead. Moreover, it was in front of so many people. Even if he returns to the Immortal Dimension, he wouldn’t be able to raise his head again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Nice! He thought he can be lawless in the Mortal Dimension. But he still can’t withstand a single strike before Chen Xi. He can properly realize that no matter if he’s a mortal or immortal, it’s better to keep a low profile.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd outside the hall seethed with excitement as all the Core Seed Disciples were shocked and satisfied when they saw Chen Xi pressure Mei Qingyuan to the point of kneeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Wen Huating and Lie Peng gasped as well, and they slightly didn’t dare believe their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard!” Mei Qingyuan’s eyes almost split apart, and he was on the verge of going mad as boundless humiliation surged out from the depths of his heart. His face turned purplish red from his fury, and he roared. “Chen Xi, you’re finished! You’re completely finished! From today onward, you’re the greatest enemy of I, Mei Qingyuan, and no one in this world can save you! No one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned while a wisp of killing intent suffused his eyes. If he was in the Talisman Dimension, he could kill this bastard freely. But after he returned to the sect, he had to consider too many things, and it caused him to be restrained and hesitant instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t like this sort of feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was even a moment that he wanted to disregard everything and annihilate all these bastards. After all, it was precisely because of these fellows that an elder of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect like him had become an enemy of the sect instead. Moreover, it even implicated everyone from the entire West Radiance Peak, and this had already offended Chen Xi’s ‘reverse scale.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! What’s wrong, Little Bastard? Kill me if you have the balls! Come on!” Mei Qingyuan’s eyes were filled with resentment while his face warped, and he shouted madly with a sharp voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d already decided that once he escaped this situation, he would surely find an opportunity to extract the tendons and tear the skin off this tiny ant before causing this tiny ant to be unable to die nor live. He wanted to repay all the humiliation he received today thousands of times over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t hesitate in the slightest to slap Mei Qingyuan on the face, and Chen Xi hit Mei Qingyuan to the point blood sprayed from his mouth and nose before Chen Xi said indifferently, “Want to die? It isn’t so easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…you…you… I’m going to fucking kill you! Kill you!” Mei Qingyuan gnashed his teeth with hatred to the point his teeth were on the verge of shattering, and he struggled madly with all his strength. But under Chen Xi’s absolute suppression, it was a futile effort in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another resounding slap sounded out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up! Who gave you the gall to try and forcefully seize people related to me?” Chen Xi’s expression was calm, yet the force he exerted was rather great, and he slapped Mei Qingyuan to the point Mei Qingyuan’s head swelled up like the head of a pig while Mei Qingyuan emitted sharp cries that sounded like pigs that were being slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wen Huating couldn’t bear to continue watching when he saw this scene, and he couldn’t help but say. “Chen Xi, it’s best to know when to stop.” The meaning within his words was that this kid had people standing behind him, and if Chen Xi were to offend these people, then it wouldn’t be beneficial to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Know when to stop? Impossible!” Mei Qingyuan’s overbearing arrogance surged up when he heard this, and he cried out in a sharp voice. “You too, old man Wen! You allowed a disciple to humiliate this Young Master, your crimes simply deserve death! Now this Young Master will give you one last chance. Capture Chen Xi and this Young Master will let bygones be bygones! Otherwise, wait to atone for you crimes for everything that happened today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi slapped Mei Qingyuan once more, causing teeth that were mixed with blood to spray onto the ground, and Mei Qingyuan’s head droned while he saw golden stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw that this bastard had finally understood the situation clearly and shut up obediently, Chen Xi raised his eyes to look at Wen Huating before he said, “Sect Master, I’ll bear all responsibility for this matter, you don’t have to bother too much about me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense!” Wen Huating’s expression finally became stern as he berated. “Remember! Even if the sky is pierced open, you’re still a disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect. So how could I, a senior, possibly look on indifferently!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, his entire body emitted a lofty and arrogant aura. He stopped enduring, stopped hesitating, and stopped worry about gains and losses, and he was filled with the dignity of a ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you remember what I said when you entered the sect for the first time? Our Nine Radiance Sword Sect is established by the sword, and it stresses upon the sword and heart being as one and forging ahead with spirit. If I lose this spirit, and if I’m even unable to take care of a disciple, then there no need for this position as Sect Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating stood with his hands behind his back. His figure was tall, his gaze was like a bolt of lightning, and he possessed a majestic and powerful imposing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Including those disciples that were outside the hall, the gazes of everyone towards Wen Huating had changed. Their gazes turned to gazes of excitement and reverence, and there was even a cohesive force surging in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man is ready to die for his friends!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a sect wanted to stand towering without falling, then it had to be operated like a metal drum from inside and out. Firstly, there was a need for responsibility because there could only be a cohesive force in the sect when the sect was responsible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wen Huating’s words that were filled with spirit had undoubtedly attained this effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Huating! Speaking such rash words for the sake of an insignificant disciple? What would others think of our sect!?” However, right at this moment, a cold grunt suddenly sounded out from outside the hall, and it was like a thunderclap that appeared abruptly and rumbled in the ears of everyone, causing their expressions to go grim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with this voice, three mighty figures appeared out of thin air in the hall as if they’d teleported here. All of their bodies were coiled with the energy of the Laws while their auras were deep like oceans. They were like scorching suns and possessed peerless divine might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an old man, a middle aged man, and a middle aged woman. At the instant they appeared in the hall, merely the auras they emitted caused the space within the hall to drone and wail, and it seemed like space itself was prostrating itself and respectfully welcoming the arrival of a group of kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person that spoke earlier was the old man in Daoist robes. His face was thin, and he had a boundlessly deep gaze and a strand of beard beneath his jaw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating took a deep breath when he saw this old man, and then he bowed with Lie Peng and said, “Martial Uncle Fei Ling!” Obviously, this person was one of the Three Sages of Nine Radiance, Fei Ling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit, it’s those two great figures from the Immortal Dimension!” At the same time, Lie Peng’s voice transmission suddenly entered Chen Xi’s ears, and his voice carried a wisp of anxiety. “Chen Xi, the middle aged man is called Mei Luoxiao, and the woman is called Yu Zhongxia. Both of them are supreme and great figures from the Immortal Dimension that are at the Heavenly Immortal Realm. Especially that Mei Luoxiao, he’s Mei Qingyuan’s Fourth Granduncle. You must endure and leave the rest to be dealt with by me and the Sect Master.”&nbsp;</span></p>

But his gaze was ghastly like lightning, and it was suffused with a horrifying sheen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Yu Zhongxia was a beautiful woman with thick and beautiful hair that was coiled into a bun. She wore violet colored dress, had a gorgeous and graceful bearing that seemed to look down upon everything in the world.</span></p>

So it turns out that their reliance is these two Heavenly Immortals…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sneered without end in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He secretly compared these two people with Bing Shitian, and even if he was unwilling to admit it, it was needless to say that even though Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia’s imposing aura was formidable, Chen Xi kept having the feeling that it was unable to compare with Bing Shitian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Bing Shitian in the Mortal Dimension was only a clone. Yet merely a clone like this possessed an imposing aura that could compare to two real Heavenly Immortals. So, Chen Xi had no choice but to suspect.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly how formidable is the cultivation of Bing Shitian’s main body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was merely his judgment based on their imposing auras on the surface. As for exactly how formidable their strengths were, Chen Xi was unable to estimate it with his current cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth Granduncle! Save me!” On the other hand, when Ancestor Fei Ling brought Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia into the hall, Mei Qingyuan who knelt on the ground suddenly emitted a loud and miserable cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, when Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia arrived here, they instantly noticed everything within the hall. Especially when they saw that those people that lay scattered all over the ground was actually those disciples that followed them to descend to the Mortal Dimension, their expressions had become gloomy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, when they saw Mei Qingyuan who knelt on the ground and had a face that was swollen to the point it seemed like the head of a pig shouting loudly for help, their faces had darkened completely while their eyes were filled with a piercingly cold and ghastly expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingyuan, stand up. Tell me what exactly has happened!” Mei Luoxiao spoke with a low voice, and his calm voice revealed unconcealed rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, there was utterly no need to ask because they could discern who did it with a single glance. But he just needed a reason to vent the rage in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, he actually felt slight disbelief.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could a little fellow possibly accomplish this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth Granduncle! It was him, him! He offended his superiors and considered everyone beneath him. Moreover, he even knocked out Junior Brother Gao and the others. His methods are despicable while his attitude is unbridled to the extreme! You must uphold justice for everyone!” Since Mei Luoxiao entered the hall, Mei Qingyuan’s spirits were refreshed. But even though he was excited in his heart, he spoke as if he was a resentful wife that had been wronged and abandoned, and he stared resentfully at Chen Xi while gnashing his teeth and speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he struggled with the intention of standing and returning to the side of his Fourth Granduncle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at this moment, a huge slap struck his face, and it struck to the point his neck almost broke while he emitted a miserable wail and knelt once more on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This slap was truly too ruthless and too quick, and it even exceeded the expectations of everyone present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia that didn’t imagine Chen Xi would dare make a move before them, even Ancestor Fei Ling, the Sect Master, and Elder Lie Peng had never expected that Chen Xi would actually act in this way at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Wen Huating and Lie Peng cried bitterly without end in their hearts because Chen Xi acting in this way was undoubtedly like pushing himself into a pile of flames, so how could they save the situation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere instantly became deathly silent. Only Mei Qingyuan’s wails of pain resounded out, and it irritated Mei Luoxiao to the point the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but twitch fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Mei…” Ancestor Fei Ling frowned and glanced at Chen Xi with slight displeasure before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to say anything.” However, before he could say anything, he was interrupted with a wave of Mei Luoxiao’s hand. His eyes were icy cold like blades as it swept past Wen Huating, Lie Peng, and the others before finally descending onto Chen Xi, and then he said, “I’m going to take this kid with me today. Do any of you have any objections?”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
