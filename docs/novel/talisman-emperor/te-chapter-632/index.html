 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It really is true!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;That piece of charred wood was really formed from a strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi recalled in his daze that An Wei had once said that for the sake of avoiding the calamity that affected the three dimensions during the primeval times, the Dark Parasol Divine Tree that linked up the Mortal Dimension and Immortal Dimension had joined forces with a supreme being to seize a trace of a chance of survival. Even though it had perished, yet it had left behind a strand of its soul in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strand of its soul had undergone the baptism of countless years and had actually transformed into a piece of charred wood now. Moreover, a tiny verdant sapling had grown out from it, and it was already gradually recovering a trace of vitality!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What condition?” said Chen Xi via voice transmission. After he recovered from his shock, he remembered that the tiny cauldron had said that it could help him obtain the charred piece of wood, but as the condition of exchange, Chen Xi had to agree to a condition of the tiny cauldron’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was before, Chen Xi would surely feel uncomfortable if the tiny cauldron spoke about conditions with him. But after experiencing the string of events on the Primeval Battlefield, he’d already understood the way the tiny cauldron handled things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a method of doing things that maintained the balance. If Chen Xi wanted to obtain anything from it, then Chen Xi had to pay the corresponding price. Doing this was good for Chen Xi’s sake, as it would prevent the tiny cauldron’s karma bringing disaster to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Help me find a piece of Chaotic Divine Crystal.” Replied the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chaotic Divine Crystal?” Chen Xi was stunned, and he was slightly unable to figure out exactly what treasure it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It exists within the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, and I’ll guide you to obtain it once you’ve gone in.” The tiny cauldron replied. “How about it, do you want to make this exchange?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I agree.” Chen Xi agreed without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was already intending to enter the Dark Parasol’s Abyss to temper himself and the tiny cauldron had said it would guide him to the location of the Chaotic Divine Crystal, so how could he not agree to such a simple condition?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait three days for me. This strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree is too strong, and for the sake of avoiding any mishaps, I require three days of time to slowly subdue it.” As soon as the tiny cauldron finished speaking, in the next moment, it had already vanished swiftly from Chen Xi’s chest, and it actually didn’t cause any spatial fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides Chen Xi, no one in the hall knew that at this instant, an extremely mysterious treasure had entered into the Icesoul Divine Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tiny cauldron only required an instant to annihilate those four Xeno-race experts in the Primeval Battlefield, yet never had I imagined that it would require three days instead to subdue the charred piece of wood. It’s obvious exactly how miraculous the strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul is…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought about how he would be able to obtain an unusual treasure in three days from now, Chen Xi’s heart burned and was filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Batch after batch of experts arrived within the hall, causing it to seem even more bustling. There were disciples from the Immortal Sects, Devil Sects, and even the formidable beings from the various clans from the Primordial Era. Moreover, there was no lack of experts from some ancient clans that were secluded from the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all these people were gathered together, and merely the aura they emitted was sufficient to shake a weak person to the point that the person’s vital energy entered into a chaotic state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the atmosphere wasn’t as harmonious as it seemed on the surface. After all, these experts were from various different and great powers of the Dark Reverie, and some were even hostile with each other. At this moment, it was already fortunate that they didn’t draw their swords against each other while being under the same roof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the Dark Parasol’s Abyss hadn’t emerged yet, otherwise, a bloody conflict would have already erupted here a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, no matter if they were friend or foe, they’d come to Icesky City for the sake of the Dark Parasol’s Abyss of legend, and they would absolutely not act rashly before they entered the Dark Parasol’s Abyss and obtained the benefits within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was obvious that once they entered the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, then no matter how friendly or hostile their relationships between each other were, they would all be competitors. At that time, perhaps they would fight with their lives on the line and cause blood to flow into rivers for the sake of a treasure or a piece of fortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sat alone before the table while silently waiting for the tiny cauldron as he sized everyone within the hall up, so he didn’t feel lonely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Long Zhenbei, he’d already stood up and sat before Daoist Crimson Sun’s table a long time ago, and both of them were drinking while speaking of something in low voices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, since he was able to make Long Zhenbei take the initiative to strike up a conversation with him, no matter if it was Daoist Crimson Sun’s status or strength, it ought to not be inferior to Long Zhenbei and might even be slightly higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, An Wei hadn’t returned since she left the Ice Cloud Pavilion, and it was a mystery what things she’d gone to buy. Her whereabouts were unknown, and it caused her to seem rather mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, Princess Leng Chan’er has come. Supposedly, she joined the Heavenflow Dao Sect, and she possesses an extremely great reputation amongst those of the younger generation. She’s one of the most dazzling Seed Disciples of the Heavenflow Dao Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, someone suddenly spoke in a low voice while looking with a burning gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, a group of people walked over, and they drew the attention of everyone within the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenflow Dao Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart shook as he raised his eyes to look ever, and he saw a beautiful young woman in a luxurious robe embroidered with phoenixes walking in while being surrounded by a group of people that seemed like a host of stars who were surroundings the bright moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beautiful young woman was obviously not human. Her ears were pointed while a red colored mark was present between her brows, and her eyes were actually sky blue in color, causing her to have an unusual charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides this, there wasn’t much difference between her appearance and that of a human. Her appearance was delicate and beautiful, her figure tall and slender, and her skin was supple like fat, crystalline and translucent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young woman obviously possessed a rather great reputation because her arrival received the attention of numerous gazes, and some people even bluntly revealed intense feelings of adoration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But a trace of a bright light flashed within Chen Xi’s eyes instead. When the Heavenflow Dao Sect was mentioned, he thought of Qing Xiuyi, Bing Shitian, Yun Lansheng, and the others, and he recalled the bet he made with Bing Shitian in the Primeval Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really wanted to know Qing Xiuyi’s situation in the Heavenflow Dao Sect now, and if she still remembered him after she recovered her memories from her previous lifetimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people in the surroundings of Princess Leng Chan’er were extremely formidable. Obviously, all of them were top figures in the Heavenflow Dao Sect. Their arrival naturally represented that one of the 10 great immortal sects, the Heavenflow Dao Sect, intended to have a hand in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Princess Leng Chan’er, I heard a peerless figure with shocking natural talent has appeared in your Heavenflow Dao Sect. Did he not come to the Icesky City? According to his character, he will surely not miss such a grand event, right?” Someone engaged in small talk with Leng Chan’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of many people shook as they’d similarly heard of this, and that peerless figure of the Heavenflow Dao Sect was called Yan Shisan. Supposedly, he possessed extraordinary natural talent and possessed the Firestar Body. Moreover, his character was extremely explosive, and he was madly addicted to battle. Every single time he left the sect to obtain tempering, he would challenge others everywhere, and he rarely lost to those of the same generation, causing him to be an extremely terrifying figure.</span></p>

Moreover, numerous great figures that shook the three dimensions had come from it, so the strengths of the disciples that were capable of obtaining its inheritance was rather outstanding.</span></p>

Her beautiful hair hung loosely on her shoulders, and she had gorgeous brows that were black like ink. Her grin was like a flower that bloomed after the rain, delicate and charming.</span></p>

Obviously, they knew how formidable Yan Shisan was, or perhaps, the person they didn’t want to encounter the most was this madman that searched near and far for people to challenge.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone actually dared to speak like this before Leng Chan’er and the experts of the Heavenflow Dao Sect, and he doesn’t care about Yan Shisan. Presumably, this person’s strength is surely extraordinary.</span></p>

However, when he sat there all alone, he seemed like a firm and lonely rock that couldn’t be moved and deep like an abyss.</span></p>

If he were to continue growing, he might possibly become an exalted figure amongst devil cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nether Spring Devil Sect was one of the six lineages of the Devil Sect, and its strength wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to any one of the 10 great immortal sects. As a Seed Disciple of the Nether Spring Devil Sect, Qiu Jun’s strength was formidable to the extreme as well.</span></p>

There were almost a thousand people that had perished at this hand, and his accomplishments in battle were shocking.</span></p>

We must bash that little girl up properly when we encounter her next!” After those beings walked into the hall, they were constantly cursing with gloomy expressions, and they entirely didn’t notice that some people within the hall carried a trace of displeasure towards their arrival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? There actually aren’t any seats left?” The being in the lead swept the hall with his gaze, and it quickly descended onto Chen Xi before he walked over directly and looked down at Chen Xi. “Friend, isn’t it too much of a waste that you’re occupying a table by yourself, you should give it up to us!”</span></p>
