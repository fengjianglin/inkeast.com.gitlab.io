 <p>The golden net formed from countless tiny and sharp sword lights descended from the sky while enveloping and locking down everything in all directions, causing Chen Xi, who was beneath it, to be unable to escape.</p>

This sword was over one meter in length, and its hilt was long, thin, and strong. The body of the sword was pitch black without the slightest impurities, like an expanse of autumn water, and the sword’s fuller was heavy and protruding like a mountain that had always sat ramrod straight on the blade. The blade itself was extremely sharp and suffused with dazzling and sharp lights that were bright as snow. &nbsp;</span></p>

Each of them had utilized different methods to allow the Talisman Armament to become a weapon that possessed boundless space to grow. But the five Divine Talismans merely possessed form, yet hadn’t had Dao Insight, Dao Territory, and the ‘force’ of the heavens and the earth fused into them, let alone condensed the phantoms of the gods of the heavens and the earth. So at this moment, this Talisman Armament could only be considered to be a Talisman Armament that was merely taking form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even then, the might of this sword was quite shocking. Chen Xi had once utilized a top-grade profound-rank sword to test its sharpness, and the outcome was the Talisman Armament was extremely formidable, as it easily sliced the top-grade profound-rank sword in half, like cutting through tofu. Most importantly, this Talisman Armament possessed five Divine Talismans that circulated and promoted each other, allowing it to derive various miraculous effects, and it also possessed an unbelievable amplification effect towards the circulation of Dao Insight!</span></p>

Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed and saw that the golden net that covered the sky would soon press down on him, and the sharp airflow blew onto him to the point a wave of piercing pain came from his eyelids.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Li Sword of Fire!” Chen Xi didn’t hesitate to lightly raise his wrist, causing the Talisman Armament to rise abruptly and sweep out towards the sharp golden net above him, and then the raging Grand Dao of Fire transformed into roiling waves of flames that roared out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>

It was a crimson red colored bull that was over 40m in height and around 27m in length. Its hooves stepped on roaring flames, and its entire body was bathed in violent flames. A single horn on its head was like a curved blade that pierced into the sky, and it flickered with a crimson red flaming light that seemed as if it wanted to melt the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Primordial Divine Beast, Inferno Bull!” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

When they saw this scene, everyone present recalled an infallible law the cultivation world had always adhered to.</span></p>

Every single one of these realms was divided into three levels, whereas, these four great realms and 12 levels were also called the four realms of Dao Insight’s 12 floored pavilion to ascend into the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meaning of these words was extremely simple. Dao Insights could be taken as the ladder to ascend the heavens, and it was divided into a total of 12 levels contained in four realms. Cultivators who cultivated step by steps on it could be supported up into the skies by clouds and ascend into Immortality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Dao Insight gasped by a cultivator attained the Initial Realm, the phenomenon of Dao Insight taking form like the Inferno Bull before their eyes now would appear. It was the phenomenon that would be produced when the Grand Dao of Fire attained the Initial Realm. Moreover, when a cultivator comprehended Dao Insight to this extent, the cultivator was already capable of starting to condense Dao Territory!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something that needed special mention was the phenomenon of Dao Insight taking form could only be produced by Grand Dao Insights, and Minor Daos were incapable of it.</span></p>

Its hooves were like seals that collapsed the sky, and every stride it took caused space to shatter. It easily tore apart the golden net that covered the sky, and with a flick of the horn on its head, the entire net formed from Goldflame sword light was sent flying before being trampled on, shattered, and melted into nothingness by its hooves that carried raging flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, Wei Yuezi’s Goldflame Skysnare was easily disintegrated, and it didn’t pose the slightest threat any longer, whereas the Inferno Bull vanished along with it.</span></p>

After being in closed door cultivation for 30 years in the world of stars, besides the first 25 years of refining the Talisman Armament, the remaining five years had been used by him to comprehend Dao Insight and practice the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture and Grand Obliteration Fist while meditating and cultivating.</span></p>

Moreover, his ability to circulate and deduce Dao Insight had become even more formidable as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, he didn’t have a sparring partner in the world of stars, so even he didn’t know to what extent had his cultivation in the Martial Dao attained. At this moment, he’d seized this strong opponent, Wei Yuezi, so he naturally had to properly feel the changes of his strength from this past few years.</span></p>

The countless talisman marking structures that were vast like an ocean resonated at the same time, and it carried along his strength to amplify his sword move, the Li Sword of Fire, causing the appearance of the scene from before.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the contribution of the Dao Grade martial technique, the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, couldn’t be forgotten. One of the eight great sword moves contained within it, the Li Sword of Fire, was a sword technique that was related to the utilization of the Grand Dao of Fire, and coupled with the amplification effect of the Talisman Armament, it created an unbelievably miraculous effect.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Dao of Fire at the 3</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">rd</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level of the Initial Realm. Wei Yuezi wouldn’t be shocked if a Dao comprehension realm like this appeared on a Golden Core Realm cultivator with extraordinary natural talent, but when it appeared on Chen Xi, it caused him to be unable to accept it.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, that sword technique is clearly a precious Dao Grade martial technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where did a cultivator from a remote little city obtain a Dao Grade martial technique? Could it be that Dao Grade martial techniques are already all over the streets now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how he speculated, Wei Yuezi had finally started to feel that this Half-step Golden Core Realm fellow that he thought he could casually annihilate had already possessed the qualifications to fight him, and he didn’t dare underestimate Chen Xi any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What other formidable techniques do you have? Execute all of them!” Chen Xi spoke indifferently, yet he was instead slightly impatient to test some sword moves in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, from the beginning of the battle until now, he’d always not utilized his full strength, even if he was against a perfection-stage Golden Core Realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Early on when in the depths of the Oceanic Desert, his cultivation was already sufficient to annihilate intermediate-stage Golden Core Realm cultivators, and he was capable of going against top Golden Core Realm experts like Huangfu Chongming. Presently, he’d been in closed door cultivation in the world of stars for 30 years, and he only lacked overcoming the tribulation of wind and fire to be ranked amongst the Golden Core Realm, so his strength had increased by more than a level when compared from before. Coupled with his Dao Comprehension realm, Dao Grade martial technique, and Magic Treasures being existences at the extreme top, it allowed him to possess the ability to surmount a realm and annihilate his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was common knowledge that when cultivators battled, there were too many factors that affected the battle. One’s own cultivation, Dao Insight comprehension, Dao Grade martial techniques, combat experience, natural talent in combat, and strength of Magic Treasures, every single one of these factors was closely linked to one’s combat strength. It wasn’t a big deal if one was strong in a single factor, and it was only truly formidable when one was strong at every aspect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivation — Chen Xi’s cultivation was at the Half-step Golden Core Realm. Both the Ice Crane Technique and Blackhole Void Technique he cultivated were top qi refinement cultivation techniques, causing his True Essences to be around 10 times thicker than ordinary cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dao Insight comprehension — He’s grasped over 10 Dao Insights. Moreover, all of them were Grand Daos and not a single one was a Minor Dao, so he surpassed ordinary cultivators by a great deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dao Grade martial technique — The Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture was publicly acknowledged in the cultivation world of the Darchu Dynasty to be the sword technique that was the most difficult to cultivate. If it was to be carefully differentiated, then this sword technique was in the ranks of top Dao Grade martial techniques as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Combat experience — After Chen Xi left Pine Mist City, he’d always been battling ceaselessly, and if it was in terms of the danger and abundance of his combat experiences, it was absolutely not something a figure like Wei Yuezi could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Natural talent in combat — It was related to one’s grasp and control of the battle. In this aspect, Chen Xi could be said to be shocking and unequaled. Early on when he was at the Congenital Realm, he was able to use an Icicle Talisman to successfully save Chen Hao and Bai Wanqing from the hands of the Li Clan’s Chief manager. All along his path until now, his sharp insight in battle and strategic level of control had caused countless people to sigh with admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magic Treasures — &nbsp;If it was before, this would perhaps be Chen Xi’s weak point. Due to the effect of the restrictions of his cultivation, he could only utilize a top-grade profound-rank Magic Treasure with his full strength and had no way of going against the earth-rank Magic Treasures in the hands of Golden Core Realm cultivators. But it was different now because of the appearance of the Talisman Armament, and it had already surpassed the quality of top-grade profound-rank. Moreover, it possessed boundless space for growth, so it was absolutely a divine weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these aspects were merely a part of Chen Xi’s strength. If his body refinement cultivation, the Divine Abilities and cultivation techniques he grasped, the strength of his soul, and the soul attack techniques he possessed were counted as well, it would surely shock a ton of people to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dammit! Truly damnable!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Yuezi’s expression was extremely ominous, and his cold and arrogant bearing had completely vanished to fully transform into cold and furious killing intent. Even though Chen Xi’s voice was light, yet it was like numerous sharp arrows that stabbed at his heart, causing him to feel boundless humiliation and rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A single strike shocks the sky and slashes out in all directions while Goldflame covers the entire sky with destruction, causing the world to be split apart as evil is annihilated. The world changes, yet the sword remains the same… Chen Xi, I’ll let you experience my Goldflame Sword Technique’s three great killer moves, Swordrain Annihilation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The sword in his hand flew out in the sky like a large river that lay across the skies. Golden waves roiled as mighty waves hit the bank of the river, and the fierce aura of slaughter shook the heavens and the earth to the point it trembled. The boundless river of sword qi converged into a vortex that crashed down with a bang, like a dazzling meteor shower that tore open the sky.</span></p>
