 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? You were actually able to injure me?” Bing Shitian was slightly shocked, as he never imagined that Chen Xi would actually be able to break open the force of his palm in the blink of an eye and press down towards him once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, needless to say, it’s truly not easy for you to have cultivated to this extent, and if you’re able to cultivate to the Earthly Immortal Realm in the future, then I really can’t imagine how formidable you would become. At that time, it might really be slightly difficult for me to kill you. But now, even if you struggle, it’s in vain!” Bing Shitian’s figure flickered in the sky, causing Chen Xi’s sword strike to instantly hit nothing but air, and it didn’t even touch the corners of Bing Shitian’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because this wasn’t any sort of movement technique but spatial teleportation!</span></p>

It was an ability of Heavenly Immortals, and Chen Xi’s attacks would have any effect on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s current strength was even capable of annihilating experts of the same cultivation realm that possessed seven times or eight times their combat strength, but when facing a Heavenly Immortal that had grasped the Spatial Laws, he would lose without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, it was useless no matter how strong his strength was. The gap in their cultivation realms wasn’t something that could be made up for with strength, combat strength, or magic treasures.</span></p>

Under these circumstances, all attacks would be unable to injure him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless Chen Xi’s attack was capable of slashing space apart and breaking through the shackles of space, otherwise, it would be impossible for Chen Xi to hit him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This green sky contained traces of the heavens and was branded with boundless profundities of the Laws. It emitted a terrifying aura that was vast, eternal, and inviolable, and it infiltrated into Chen Xi’s Dao Art and deterred him to the point he almost lost the will to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, his Dao Heart had already undergone a tremendous transformation in the Door of Profundity, and it was pure and condensed like glass, causing him to return to his senses after merely being stunned for an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he could resist, the green sky had already smashed down and trapped him directly. His surroundings were suffused with extremely powerful energies of profound Laws, and they were even more condensed and powerful that the profundities of the Grand Dao by a myriad of times more. With his current strength, he was utterly incapable of struggling free from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the strength of a Heavenly Immortal!</span></p>

This level of might was absolutely not something any cultivator in the Mortal Dimension could go against!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack! Crack!</span></p>

It seemed as if a myriad of large mountains were pressing down from above him, and his surroundings were suffused with Immortal Energy and the energy of the laws, causing it to be impossible to resist. The bones in his entire body emitted a wave of clear sounds that caused one’s teeth to ache, and it seemed as if he would shatter into pieces in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body was even pressured to the point traces of scarlet red threads of blood flowed out from every single pore on his body, and he was instantly covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the only good thing was that his body refinement cultivation was extremely formidable. So even if his body was destroyed, so long as his Soul Core wasn’t annihilated, he would be able to be reborn from a single drop of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi knew the situation was dire as well. He converged all the strength in his body around him while protecting his Soul Core at the center, and he couldn’t be bothered about escaping any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>

He was on the verge on being unable to hold on any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be imagined that if this pressure continued like this, then he would sooner or later be completely pressed into a piece of flat mush and perish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good! You’re actually able to resist to this extent. You really deserve to be a genius figure that possesses the potential to become an exalted figure. You didn’t disappoint me. If I give you another 100 years of time, then perhaps you’ll really be able to grow to the extent of being able to go against me.” Bing Shitian stood with his hands behind his back, and his expression was icy cold and indifferent to the extreme while his eyes surged with killing intent. “Unfortunately, you’re bound to die today, and that forsaker of the heavens, Liu Jianheng, won’t be able to save you ever again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his palm swung about repeatedly before pressing down towards Chen Xi once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi instantly felt the pressure exerted upon him had increased once more by more than 10 times!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He urged his Blackhole World to circulate repeatedly, yet it was in vain. The green sky was too terrifying, and it caused him to have the feeling of being unable to move and being confined within a cage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Bing Shitian’s feathered clothed fluttered while his expression was icy cold to the extreme, and he clenched his hand into a fist as he made a grasping gesture towards the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu! Pu! Pu!</span></p>

His bones broke while numerous fountains of blood shot out all over his body, causing it to be an extremely terrifying sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, this myriad of chains were extremely harmful to the Soul Core and soul. They emitted an energy of confinement that intended to extract both Chen Xi’s soul and Soul Core out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi felt boundless pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

It emitted a vast divine glow that was suffused with boundless divine rays of light. At the instant it appeared, it directly shattered all the myriad of chains into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s actually you!?” Bing Shitian’s pupils constricted as he instantly recognized this jade cauldron. Shockingly, it was the formidable existence that displayed invincible might in the Primeval Battlefield and annihilate four Xeno-race experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in next to no time, he noticed the strength of this jade cauldron was far inferior when compared to that day. This caused him to come to a sudden understanding and not be worried any longer.</span></p>
