It was deep, pitch black, and suffused with a horrifying sheen, and it seemed like a door that lead to the mysterious unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Chen Xi’s guess, the blackhole was probably the door that led to the Creation Sword Domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t move instead, and his gaze shot towards the sky at the side as he seemed to have noticed something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was completely silent, yet because it was silent, it seemed to be unusual instead. Along with Chen Xi’s gaze sweeping out, he instantly understood why this place would be unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because there was actually group after group of figures lying in ambush within the sky in an area of 500km around the black hole!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those figures formed groups of three to five and ought to belong to different powers, and they were scattered at different positions while using some sort of secret technique to actually be able to conceal themselves within space, causing their figures to be completely hidden out of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were like venomous snakes that were concealed in the shadows, hidden from the eye of others, and it caused them to be difficult to be noticed by others. It was even to the extent that it was impossible to notice them with Divine Sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for Chen Xi possessing the Eye of Divine Truth that was capable of seeing true reality and to see through the truth behind something, Chen Xi would have almost been deceived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But all of them had been completely exposed down to the slightest detail before his eyes, and he instantly noticed that there were 78 people that belonged to 13 powers lying in ambush in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he even clearly saw that when the gazes of these people descended onto him, all of them revealed imperceptible traces of excitement and cruelty.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They seemed like a group of wild beasts that had set their sights on a lamb that had fallen into a trap.</span></p>

Lying in ambush in the surroundings of the entrance to the Creation Sword Domain is indeed a superb location to rob and kill. If an ordinary person comes over, the person would probably become dizzy from the pleasant surprise of discovering the Creation Sword Domain, so how could the person possibly notice the layer upon layer of killing intent lying in ambush in the surroundings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An imperceptible wisp of a cold expression suffused the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth as he’d guessed the purpose of these people were lying in ambush here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

It was cunning and sinister, and it struck directly towards his heart from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At practically the exact same moment, a few more figures leaped out at the same time from the sky on the other side, and they assaulted Chen Xi from different angles. Their movements were extraordinarily swift, and their attacks were swift and mighty like lightning. Obviously, they intended to kill Chen Xi with one strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the entire surroundings were covered in piercingly cold and terrifying killing intent, and it was like a heaven encompassing net that completely locked down all Chen Xi’s paths of retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was anyone else here at this moment, the person would probably be shocked to the point of being dazed when facing this sudden scene, and the person could only wait helplessly for death to arrive. In the end, the person would be tortured and killed before the treasures in the person’s possession would be completely plundered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This group of experts was extremely formidable because it was impossible for weaklings to arrive here. Unfortunately, they’d chosen the wrong target and had actually targeted Chen Xi, so they deserved to suffer calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the peerless genius Yan Shisan wasn’t a match for him, let alone them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck off!” Chen Xi hadn’t moved yet a terrifying aura surged out explosively from him, and his voice sounded like spring thunder as he spat out two words. He’d already included the profundities of the Slaughter Dao Insight within this shout, causing its might to be extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

All of their bodies shook violently as the bones and meridians in their entire bodies were shattered, and blood sprayed from both their mouths and nose as they fell lifelessly into the Nether Spring Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AH!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water from the Nether Springs was exceedingly overbearing. No matter how formidable one’s cultivation was, merely being tainted by a single drop would cause one’s consciousness to be corroded while one’s flesh and bones were melted, causing one to transform into a spirit that lacked a consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These assailants had just fallen into the Nether Spring Ocean when they instantly emitted exceedingly shrill and miserable cries. After a short moment, they were completely swallowed by the Nether Spring water to the point not even scraps remained, and it was an extremely horrifying sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the other people concealed within space itself gasped when they saw this scene, and their entire bodies went cold. They instantly knew that this young man that had come here alone was a formidable figure that absolutely couldn’t be offended because his strength was terrifying to the extreme!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he killed these ignorant fools, Chen Xi seemed as if he’d done an extremely normal thing and dusted his clothes before sweeping the surroundings with his gaze, and then he didn’t hesitate any longer to unfold the Wings of Disruption and flash towards the black hole that floated in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, he’d vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, all the groups of experts hidden in space looked at each other. Especially that icy cold gaze that Chen Xi shot at them before leaving, it still caused them to be extremely terrified even at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of gaze was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Icy cold like a blade, it penetrated right down to the heart, and it seemed like the gaze of a god that was looking down at an ant and was filled with dignity that couldn’t be provoked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who’s that fellow?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why would there be such a formidable figure in the world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were unable to guess the answer, and it was precisely because of their inability that it caused them to feel horrified. Fortunately, Chen Xi had already left, and it allowed them to be slightly at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could recover from his shock, in the next moment, he’d arrived at a strange area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sky that was thick like blood, a ground that was crimson red as if it was soaked with boundless scarlet red flesh blood. This vast, boundless, and desolate area was covered in the color of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like the blood of the gods had been sprayed all over the ground, it was like a horrifying ancient battlefield, and the air was suffused with a bloody aura that caused one’s mind to become restless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The slightest weakness of the will might cause one’s inner demons to be drawn out by the bloody aura, causing one to lose control of one’s emotions and transform into a bloodthirsty and insane madman. It was even to the extent that one might experience qi deviation and have one’s foundation destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is the Creation Sword Domain?</span></p>

During the primeval times, they moved about in large numbers and had once ruled over a terrifying period of time. Every single one of them is capable of destroying a mountain and possesses boundless strength. Moreover, they once devoured a real god, causing them to possess a monstrous reputation.” The tiny cauldron reminded abruptly. “You have to be careful. This expanse of the heavens and the earth is filled with the bloody baleful qi formed from the fall of gods and devils. Once you enter battle, it’s extremely easy for your mind to be blinded by this bloody baleful qi, causing you to lose your cool before being completely reduced to a madman that only knows how to fight.”</span></p>

Even though he possessed the Dark Parasol sapling and didn’t have to worry about his True Essence drying up, but what if the bloody baleful qi caused him to lose his mind, that would be troublesome…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t forget that this is the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, and it was formed from the Dark Parasol Divine Tree. You possess a strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul in your body and being here is no different than returning to your own territory. Those Primeval God Devourer Ants wouldn’t dare make things difficult for you.” The tiny cauldron seemed to have seen through Chen Xi’s worries and reminded.</span></p>
