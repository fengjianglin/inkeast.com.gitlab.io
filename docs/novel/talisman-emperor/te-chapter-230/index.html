 <p>Chapter 230 – Breaking Through and Entering</p>
 <p>The Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl was an extremely miraculous and profound treasure that was capable of finding all concealed spaces within an area of 50 kilometers, and it was even capable of breaking through the barriers surroundings some secret realms and immortal abodes.</p>
 <p>Relying on this pearl, the Su Clan’s youngest elder, Su Leng, had found numerous secret realms and immortal abodes. He’d even obtained a huge amount of cultivation techniques, medicinal pills, and precious treasures from them, making him to cause a great stir in Dragon Lake City. But along with the death of Su Leng, this pearl had fallen into Chen Xi’s hands.</p>
 <p><i>Su Leng was a figure that possessed great fortune all those years ago, yet along with his death, not only has the Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl fallen into my hands, even the mysterious Netherworld Register and Condemn Evil Brush have become mine. Destiny really makes a fool of people. </i>Chen Xi sighed emotionally without end in his heart, and then he raised his eyes to look at Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault that was in the air.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault that lay across the heavens and the earth had already gradually revealed its true face. It seemed to be constructed completely out of the most pure and flawless jade, and 36 enormous pillars that seemed to be made of gold supported it from below. The surface of the treasure vault was inscribed with the sun, moon, stars, various living creatures and plants, and dense and complicated talisman markings, and layers of screens that were like water ripples suffused its surface, causing one to only be capable of vaguely seeing the pavilions and halls within it.</p>
 <p>The beautiful rays of light in the surroundings were like a veil that separated the treasure vault from the outside world.</p>
 <p>Shockingly, there were statues of primordial divine beasts occupying the top of the treasure vault. There was a Three-Legged Golden Crow, an Azure Scaled Dragon, a Bi’an, a Suanni, a Chiwen, a Qiuniu[1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_sons_of_the_dragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_sons_of_the_dragon</a>]... and so on and so forth. All of them were enormous and majestic like mountains, and their expressions were upright and unyielding as they silently occupied the top of the treasure vault. Even though they were lifeless things, they seemed like gods that looked down indifferently upon the world, and an overbearing air of looking down at the world arose from then and caused others to be awed.</p>
 <p>The heaven shaking scene of divine beasts occupying it caused Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault to absolutely seems of extraordinary origin!</p>
 <p><i>Are all the things like the Heavenly Immortal’s inheritance, cultivation technique, medicinal pill, precious treasures, and the profound and unfathomable Dao Insight Origin Pill sealed and stored within this enormous treasure vault? </i>Chen Xi’s heart burned with yearning, and he didn’t hesitate any longer as his figure that had transformed into a strand of spirit fire silently approached towards the beautiful and dazzling Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault.</p>
 <p><i>What a formidable restriction!</i><i></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The closer he approached to the treasure vault, the more vividly he felt a shapeless forcefield fill the area before him, and it was like he was facing a boundless ocean that couldn’t be surmounted. Moreover, this energy wasn’t motionless, and on the contrary, it seemed to have noticed Chen Xi’s approach, causing it to surge over from all directions in unison before fiercely pressing onto him. Even with his current cultivation, he couldn’t help but feel suffocated, and the bones in his entire body seemed to be unable to endure this enormous force and emitted clear cracking sounds.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chen Xi was only three steps away from Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault, yet no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to move in the slightest. Moreover, along with the passage of time, the shapeless force that pressed over from the surroundings became stronger and stronger, causing him to be like an ant that was shackled at the depths of the sea, and he seemed as if he would be squashed by it in the next moment.</p>
 <p>A distance of three steps already seemed like a wide chasm, and even an Earthly Immortal Realm expert would be incapable of forcefully breaking through the shapeless forcefield that filled every inch of space.</p>
 <p>Om!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chen Xi didn’t hesitate in the slightest to withdraw the Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl and pour all his True Essence into it, and then a wisp of a gorgeous and multicolored light surged out from the pearl. Under the illumination of this multicolored light, a layer of warping and translucent fluctuation suddenly appeared before Chen Xi, and he knew that this was the restriction barrier on the surroundings of the treasure vault.</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>With the Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl in his hand, the shapeless and translucent restriction was like a pricked bubble as a long and narrow crack was split open on it, and it led directly into Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault. Chen Xi didn’t dare dally in the slightest when he saw this scene, and he flashed out to slip in before vanishing completely.</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p>“Shit! Someone has gone in first!”</p>
 <p>“Dammit! What was that multicolored light? There’s a restriction barrier refined by a Heavenly Immortal Realm expert on the surroundings of Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault, after all. How could it possibly be cracked open?”</p>
 <p>“The Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Realm! It’s surely this treasure! In the world, only the Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl is capable of disregarding any barriers and restrictions!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Right when Chen Xi broke open the restriction barrier of Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault, the multicolored light emitted by the Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl had instantly drawn the attention of the nearby Huangfu Chongming, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, and the others.</p>
 <p>They’d always been staring fixedly at Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault and were waiting for the restriction barrier to vanish before charging in at the first possible moment, yet how could they have imagined that there was actually someone that was a step ahead of them?</p>
 <p>“Bastard! I recognize that fellow, it’s that Golden Hall Realm kid, Chen Xi!”</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi? How could it possibly be him? How could he possess such a precious treasure like the Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl?”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to say any more. So what if he’s a step ahead of us? After we enter, we’ll kill him and seize all the treasures he’s plundered.”</p>
 <p>After they identified that the fellow who slipped into the treasure vault was Chen Xi, the expressions of Huangfu Chongming and the others darkened as the flames of rage in their chests blazed, and they wished for nothing more than to tear Chen Xi into pieces. But they were helpless at this moment. They didn’t possess a Boundless Secretrealm Discovering Pearl, after all, so they could only wait for the restriction barrier on the treasure vault to vanish by itself before they could enter.</p>
 <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a wave of dense sounds of the air being split apart sounded out from the distant horizon, and then numerous streaks flashed over here from the horizon. With a rough count, there were at least over 100 people, and there might be even more people that would rush over later.</p>
 <p>“An Qianyu of the central plains’ Skysplit Sword Sect!”</p>
 <p>“Wang Daoxu of the central plains’ Brightray Sect!”</p>
 <p>“Zhen Liuqing of the eastern sea’s Mistwater Pavilion!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Along with the appearance of those streaks, Huangfu Chongming, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, and the others revealed surprised and bewildered expressions, and they seemed to have never imagined that they would actually encounter so many outstanding and well known figures of the younger generation here, causing their hearts to instantly become exceedingly heavy.</p>
 <p>The more experts that entered Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault, the greater the competition would be. When there are too many wolves, yet too little meat, battles were unavoidable, and no one was willing to see this scene occur.</p>
 <p>“How good would it be if Miss Qing is here!” Huangfu Chongming sighed suddenly. At this moment, he fully appreciated the benefits of Qing Xiuyi’s presence. If she was here to hold down the fort, why would he be worried about fighting with the other forces?</p>
 <p>When this sigh entered into the ears of the others, it obtained the acknowledgment of every single one of them. Qing Xiuyi could be considered to be the most outstanding and dazzling star in the Darchu Dynasty, and if anyone wanted to go against their group, they’d first have to weigh their strengths against Qing Xiuyi. Under other’s hesitation to take action, the treasures they would be able to gain would naturally increase greatly.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Qing Xiuyi wasn’t present now, and she’d vanished without a trace. No one knew where she’d gone.</p>
 <p>At this moment, along with the arrival of more and more cultivators, the scene instantly became a magnificent sight. All of these cultivators were top figures in the younger generation of the various areas in the Darchu Dynasty, and practically all these few hundred disciples of the various sects possessed a cultivation at the Golden Core Realm. All of them respectively occupied a different area and didn’t disturb each other, yet they faintly formed a confrontational situation that caused the atmosphere to seem exceedingly oppressive.</p>
 <p>To Huangfu Chongming and the other’s relief, their group gathered the cultivators of the Earthly Heaven Sect, Nine Cauldrons Immortal Sect, Dragonshark Isle, Skycave Mountain, and the Wise King’s Estate, and it could be said to be filled with excellent members, causing them to faintly become the strongest group amongst the numerous cultivators, so they didn’t have to be afraid of other powers.</p>
 <p>Dong!</p>
 <p>After 10 minutes, a clear ring that was like a morning bell lingered in the air as it resounded in the heavens and the earth.</p>
 <p>Everyone present swiftly raised their heads and looked over, and Qiang Yuan’s Treasure Vault that floated silently in midair rumbled as it opened its grand and magnificent entrance!</p>
 <p>After that, an arched bridged that seemed to be paved by clouds condensed into form outside the treasure vault’s entrance, and it was like a rainbow bridge that spanned across the heavens and the earth and led directly towards the treasure vault within the entrance.</p>
 <p>At practically the exact same time, a vast and lofty pressure that looked down upon all living beings swiftly swept through the heavens and the earth, then boundless flames that seemed like lava that came from the depths of the earth’s core suddenly surged out into the surroundings of the treasure vault, and it seemed to want to burn the entire world with its flames.</p>
 <p>The terrifying wave of heat seemed capable of melting anything, and it even forced the nearby cultivators to retreat repeatedly.</p>
 <p>Swoosh! Swish! Swish! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a few streaks flashed past in the sky, and they stepped onto the rainbow bridge and charged swiftly towards the entrance of the treasure vault.</p>
 <p>“You’re courting death!” Huangfu Chongming’s eyes exploded out with boundless killing intent, as there were actually people that were entering the treasure vault before his group. How could he not be enraged?</p>
 <p>“Young Prince Huangfu, let’s go quickly as well…” Tantai Hong hadn’t finished speaking when he stopped abruptly. The streaks formed by the cultivators that flashed over towards the treasure vault first didn’t even have the chance to emit a shrill cry before they transformed into a ball of flames that vanished in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>The surroundings of the treasure vault were coiled with beautiful lights and soaring flames, and only when approached them would one be able to truly feel how high the temperature the flames were. The tragic deaths of those cultivators were like a bucket of cold water that instantly doused the flames of eagerness in the hearts of everyone.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Those idiots from earlier only cared about moving ahead, yet forgot to defend against the flames in the surroundings. We only have to take out a formidable Magic Treasure and charge through that wall of flames, and we’ll be capable of entering it!” Huangfu Chongming’s eyes narrowed as he swiftly spoke via voice transmission. He’s already perceived that even though there was a rainbow bridge that passed through the scorching flames that coiled the surroundings of the treasure vault, yet they obviously had to avoid those flames when entering.</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he withdrew an iron fan that seemed as if it was tempered from scales, and the dull and lusterless surface of the fan suddenly emitted a light barrier that was like rippling water. The roiling waves of water covered him and allowed him to easily pass through the flames in the surroundings.</p>
 <p>At practically the exact same time, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, Tantai Hong, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, and the others withdrew their own Magic Treasures before tearing through the sky with a swish.</p>
 <p>Actually, it wasn’t only Huangfu Chongming’s group; the other cultivators present had also noticed the secret behind it, and they withdrew their respective water element Magic Treasures before tearing through the sky and heading rapidly towards the treasure vault.</p>
 <p>For a time, the sky was filled with streaks that overflowed with multicolored flowing lights.</p>
 <p>When they saw this scene, some cultivators that possessed cultivations only at the Golden Hall Realm couldn’t help but become restless, and they overestimated their ability as they charged towards the treasure vault. The outcome instilled fear in their hearts as not a single one of them survived, and they transformed into ash within the merciless flames.</p>
 <p>Most astonishing of it all was that during this period, there was a cultivator that obviously possessed a cultivation at the Rebirth Realm, yet he was blocked out by the treasure vault. The surroundings of the treasure vault seemed to possess a layer of shapeless forcefield that caused him to be incapable of approaching the treasure vault by a single step, no matter what formidable technique he executed!</p>
 <p>Inexorably, the wide open entrance of Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault seemed to only be opened to Golden Core Realm cultivators, and it seemed extremely mysterious.</p>
