 <p>Chapter 245 – A Frenzied Chase</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was fleeing.</p>
 <p>The Divine Windwing Flight that had been combined with the Dao Insights of Sky and Wind was executed to the limit by him, causing his entire body to seem like a strand of a translucent gale that fled within the boundless Oceanic Desert with a speed so swift that he moved 3km in an instant.</p>
 <p>The surrounding scenery seemed like passing shadows as they flashed past his eyes, and due to his speed being too swift, all the scenery before him that were reflected into his eyes seemed to have warped into numerous strange and unusual shadows.</p>
 <p>He had to flee because after he was transported out of Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault, he originally thought he could catch his breath, yet never had he imagined that he’d only just descended to the ground when he noticed Huangfu Chongming, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, and the others were actually nearby him.</p>
 <p>It was even to the extent that An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, and Zhen Liuqing were not far away from him.</p>
 <p>It was fine if it was only one or two of them, as Chen Xi wouldn’t be afraid of battling them.</p>
 <p>But this was a group of people! A group of Golden Core Realm experts of the Darchu Dynasty’s younger generation!</p>
 <p>Moreover, these fellows hated Chen Xi to the bone and held the resolute intention of killing him, so he could only choose to flee when faced with a situation like this.</p>
 <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>
 <p>A wave of sharp and ear piercing sounds of the sky being torn apart sounded from behind him, and Chen Xi didn’t have to turn around to know that Huangfu Chongming and the others were still persistently following behind him without relaxing in the slightest, causing his situation to be extremely dangerous.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi knew in his heart why these people would be chasing him so desperately.</p>
 <p>There were truly too many treasures in his possession. The Buddha’s Pagoda, the Netherworld Register, and the Condemn Evil Brush all possessed values that were comparable to Immortal Artifacts.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he’d plundered almost 100,000 Sky Jadeliquid Pills, a sword formation created from over 10,000 high-grade earth-rank swords, and countless rare materials from the treasure vault; the total value of these treasures was an astronomical figure that would cause anyone to go mad.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that during the final three tests of the treasure vault, he’d obtained a Half-step Dao Grade martial technique, the Grand Obliteration Fist, a Dao Insight Origin Pill that contained the Grand Dao of Earth, and a Sky Key that possessed a value that far exceeded the imagination of anymore.</p>
 <p>If all of these treasures were combined together, even Heavenly Immortals would probably be covetous and fight to the death for the sake of it, let alone Huangfu Chongming and the others.</p>
 <p>Men died in the pursuit of fortune just as animals died in the pursuit of food. This was a famous dictum that survived the ages.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi knew his situation extremely well. He knew that so long as he was captured, even if he didn’t die, he’d be heavily injured, and all the treasures in his possession would be plundered. A situation like this was something he was absolutely unable to allow.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of this that he didn’t dare slack off for a moment as he fled. His nerves strained as he gritted his teeth tightly, and the essence, energy, and spirit of his entire body attained an unprecedented peak state, whereas his mind was instead cool like ice as he pondered a method to deal with the situation.</p>
 <p><i>Huangfu Chongming and the others possess cultivations at the Golden Core Realm, and so long as they possess sufficient medicinal pills to replenish their True Essence, they’d be capable of continuously chasing after me. So, I have to find a safe place as soon as possible, otherwise, once my strength dries up, I’ll become a lamb that’s at the mercy of others, and my situation will be extremely worrying…</i></p>
 <p><i>However, where should I flee? The Baleful Fiend Burial Grounds? The Thunderstorm Zone? Or the Dead Sea of Spirits?</i></p>
 <p>“Chen Xi, I’ll give you one final chance. Stop obediently and hand over the treasures, and I’ll exempt you from death. Otherwise, if you’re caught by me, then not only you, but even your friends and relatives will be buried alongside with you!” Right when Chen Xi was pondering about a method to escape, Huangfu Chongming’s extremely gloomy and icy cold voice abruptly sounded out from behind, and the killing intent in his words was undisguised and revealed completely.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi instead turned a deaf ear to it and still continued flying swiftly without the slightest trace of stopping. He’d experienced this level of threats numerous times since long ago, and he naturally wouldn’t take it seriously.</p>
 <p>But the final sentence Huangfu Chongming spoke caused boundless killing intent to arise in his heart. As the saying went, the innocent shouldn’t be dragged into disaster. For the sake of threatening him to submit, Huangfu Chongming had actually aroused the thought of annihilating Chen Xi’s friends and relatives, and it was simply an unforgivable crime!</p>
 <p>“You’re thinking about how to escape? Hmph! A monk may run away, but the temple remains. So what if you escape? Now that I’ve already found out about your identity, I only have to capture your friends and family, and then let’s see if you’ll still not obediently allow yourself to be captured!” Huangfu Chongming’s ghastly and gloomy voice sounded out once again from behind him.</p>
 <p>The killing intent in Chen Xi’s heart skyrocketed with a bang when he heard this. The thing he hated the most was when people used the lives of his friends and family to threaten him. Presently, he only had a single relative, Chen Hao, in the world. If Chen Hao were to be captured and killed by Huangfu Chongming, then he would absolutely be unable to forgive himself.</p>
 <p>“Hu!” Chen Xi took a deep breath and identified a direction before flying with all his might.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he wasn’t thinking about anything as there was only a single thought in his mind — Rush back to Pine Mist City in the shortest time possible, because Chen Hao was there and the rebuilt Chen Clan was there as well…</p>
 <p>However, he instead seemed to have forgotten that this was the depths of the Oceanic Desert, and it was at least 50,000km away from Pine Mist City that was by the side of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range. It was utterly impossible for him to fly all the way to Pine Misty City without stopping with his current cultivation.</p>
 <p>Unless he advanced to the Golden Core Realm and was capable of utilizing medicinal pills to replenish his True Essence, otherwise, he would probably completely consume all of his strength before flying through half that distance.</p>
 <p>But at this moment, Chen Xi couldn’t care about anything, and he was stubborn like a madman.</p>
 <p>There was only a single reason for this — to protect his younger brother, Chen Hao!</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p><i>This Bastard is really disregarding his life for the sake of his treasures!</i></p>
 <p>Rage skyrocketed within the heart of Huangfu Chongming, who was chasing closely behind Chen Xi ,when he saw that Chen Xi seemed to have turned a deaf ear to his words. He wished for nothing more than to capture Chen Xi before skinning him alive and pulling out his tendons, and then he would drink his blood and eat his flesh!</p>
 <p>“Young Prince, don’t be anxious. This kid only possesses a cultivation at the Golden Hall Realm, and is unlike us who are able to maintain ample True Essence so long as we possess sufficient spirit pills. Once his True Essence is completely consumed, wouldn’t he have to obediently allow himself to be captured?” Liu Fengchi consoled. He wore blue clothes and stood on a bright and watery sword as if he was standing on flashing waves, and his speed was extremely swift.</p>
 <p>Actually, it wasn’t just him. Man Hong, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, and the others were utilizing their own flying Magic Treasures with a speed that wasn’t inferior to the others.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for Chen Xi’s Divine Windwing Flight having combined with the Sky and Wind Dao Insight, they’d probably have caught up with him a long time ago.</p>
 <p>But even then, they still felt extremely shocked by Chen Xi’s speed. <i>This fellow is only at the Golden Hall Realm, yet possesses such a marvelous movement technique that even we can only follow closely behind, yet be unable to catch up. If he’s allowed to advance to the Golden Core Realm, then wouldn’t he be even more outstanding?</i></p>
 <p>“I know this. I’m just slightly infuriated. This kid is simply like an extremely slippery loach and is always able to save himself in a desperate situation, yet he just so happens to have extremely great luck. If we’re unable to kill him this time, then I’m afraid I’ll be unable to eat and sleep in peace in the future.” Huangfu Chongming shook his head and sighed lightly.</p>
 <p>The others revealed an expression of deep agreement when they heard this as they agreed extremely with what Huangfu Chongming had said.</p>
 <p>“But Young Prince. An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, and Zhen Liuqing are following closely from behind us. If these three people were to poke their noses in, then I’m afraid it will be extremely troublesome.” Liu Fengchi frowned abruptly.</p>
 <p>Huangfu Chongming’s eyes flickered with cold lights as he sneered. “Let’s not care about them for now. If something really happens at that time, then we can only kill them. I presume everyone is unwilling to see a portion of the treasures in Chen Xi’s possession be seized away by those three people, right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course.” The others didn’t hesitate in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Then we don’t have to pay attention to them, as our strengths are more than enough to annihilate the three of them. As for if we’ll cause the members of the sects behind him to make a move against us. Hmph! For the sake of the treasures, we can’t care about anything else!” Huangfu Chongming’s eyes narrowed as he spoke with a ghastly tone.</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p>Two days later.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi felt his ears buzzing, his entire body exhausted, his entire body seemed like a corpse that was just pulled out from the water, and every single inch of his skin burned with pain.</p>
 <p>Even with his powerful body, flying swiftly at full strength for two days straight was too much for him. Coupled with his lack of a flying Magic Treasure and flying purely on the strength of his body, the consumption of his strength was extremely shocking as well.</p>
 <p>Compared to the exhaustion in his entire body, the consumption of his True Essence was the most troubling to him. At this moment, only a mere 10% of the True Essence within his Dantian remained, and according to this speed of flight, it wouldn’t be an hour before his True Essence would dry up.</p>
 <p>As for the Shaman Energy that surged within his flesh, he didn’t intend to use it, as he was keeping it to protect his life at the final moment. Once he utilized it, it would be no different than falling into eternal doom. In that way, there would be no meaning in him fleeing this time.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, he’d already flown out of the Oceanic Desert now, and just earlier, he’d even flown past the territory of Misty Sea City. According to his estimations, so long as he persisted for another day, it would be sufficient for him to arrive at Pine Mist City.</p>
 <p>Actually, Chen Xi knew as well that so long as he changed his direction at this moment and charged towards Dragon Lake City, then so long as he arrived at the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, these fellows wouldn’t dare act rashly with the presence of his big brother, the Earthly Immortal Realm expert, Bei Heng.</p>
 <p>But he didn’t intend to do this. Everyone in Huangfu Chongming’s group was an expert of the younger generation with great backgrounds and came from various places in the Darchu Dynasty, and they were absolutely not something Bei Heng and the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect could go against. It was alright if he went there to seek protection, yet it would cause an extremely great trouble for the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. If the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect were to be taken revenge on by the powers behind Huangfu Chongming and the others, and the outcome was similarly something Chen Xi was unable to accept.</p>
 <p><i>If I really can’t carry on, then I’ll utilize the Sky Jadeliquid Pill. I ought to be able to withstand the charge of its enormous medicinal strength by relying on my cultivation in body refinement… </i>Chen Xi gritted his teeth and had already made up his mind. If he was unable to escape the chase of Huangfu Chongming and the others before his True Essence dried up, then he would consume the Sky Jadeliquid Pill. As for whether it would injure his Dao Foundation, he didn’t care.</p>
 <p>This was an act of being forced to the point of helplessness. Since cultivating until now, there was never a moment where he was in such a sorry state and was in such danger, yet was so helpless…</p>
 <p>Moreover, Chen Xi had already hated Huangfu Chongming and the others to the bones, and he’d already decided in his heart that so long as he was able to escape the calamity today, he would surely exterminate all these bastards in the future!</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p>“Motherfucker! Is this kid made of iron? Two days have passed already, yet his True Essence hasn’t been completely consumed?” Huangfu Chongming couldn’t care about maintaining the bearing of a young prince as he gave vent to a torrent of curses, and his expression was extremely gloomy.</p>
 <p>Even he felt a wave of exhaustion and weariness after chasing after Chen Xi for two days and two nights, and his entire body felt uncomfortable. If it wasn’t for the fact that he coveted the treasures in Chen Xi’s possession, he’d probably have turned around and left long ago to find a nice place to sleep.</p>
 <p>The eyes of the others were bloodshot as well, their expressions unsightly to the extreme, and the flames of rage in their hearts had reached its utmost degree.</p>
 <p>They were Core Disciples that came from various great sects that led comfortable lives and possessed respected identities. Yet at this moment, they seemed like useless constables of the mortal world that were chasing after a criminal, and they chased tirelessly no matter the condition without stopping to eat nor drink…</p>
 <p>Even though they had spirit pills to replenish their strength and didn’t have to worry about their True Essence being insufficient, a life like this was simply a type of torture, and it caused their hearts and body to feel extreme suffering.</p>
 <p>They didn’t do anything during these two days and had only thought of thousands of methods to torture another, and they were waiting to capture Chen Xi before executing these methods one by one to vent the hatred in their hearts.</p>
 <p>“Eh! Look, quickly! This fellow seems to be unable to go on! Everyone, chase after him quickly!” Liu Fengchi suddenly spoke out, and his voice revealed extremely pleasant surprise.</p>
 <p>The spirits of everyone was refreshed instantly. As expected, they noticed that the aura of the figure that was flying 300m away revealed a trace of imperceptible disorder!</p>
 <p><i>The heavens aren’t blind! An opportunity has finally arrived!</i></p>
 <p>The excitement in the hearts of everyone was difficult to restrain when they saw this scene, and their faces were on the verge of being covered in tears.</p>
