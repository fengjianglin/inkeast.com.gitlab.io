 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first person he saw after he opened his eyes was a beautiful and cute little girl that wore beast skin clothes, and she was holding a shoddy large bowl while feeding him medicinal soup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The medicine was extremely bitter. Chen Xi tasted it carefully for a moment and noticed that there was practically no spirit medicine within this medicinal soul, and besides allowing him to replenish some water which he needed, it was of utterly no use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the little girl seemed as if she was holding a bowl of rare divine treasures, and she carefully placed it to the side of his mouth and seemed to be deeply afraid of dropping a drop of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is this?” Chen Xi spoke with an extremely hoarse voice that seemed to have been grinded out from sand, and even he himself was shocked for a moment before he couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense pain that felt like a myriad of ants devouring his heart surged through his entire body once more, and it hurt to the point his brows knit tightly together while a layer of cold sweat leaked out from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did he sense that the cracked open wounds on his entire body had already been wrapped by a layer of soft beast skin, and his flesh and blood were completely dried up. Not to mention Shaman Energy, even his vigor and vitality seemed to have been exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the situation within his body was even more severe. His veins had split apart inch by inch while his internal organs were damaged, dim, and lusterless. Even his Dantian seemed like a cracked up land that was completely empty and dried up, whereas his Blackhole World had already collapsed and shattered to the point of being impossible to find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that he was currently no different than a cripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah! You’re awake! Uncle Meng Wei, Aunty Mo Ya, this big brother has woken up!” The beautiful and cute little girl in beast skin clothes was stunned, and she hurried out of the tent while crying out with a clear voice. During this process, she still held tightly onto the large bowl that was filled with medicinal soup and didn’t drop a single drop as if she was holding a bowl of the rarest delicacy in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Meng Wei? Mo Ya?” Chen Xi frowned, and then he forcefully endured the violent pain in his entire body and sized up his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a beast skin tent that was extremely simple and crude, and there were practically no decorations and furnishing within it. There was only a piece of wood burning in the center and emitting a pale yellow and flickering glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything within here was primitive, ancient, and suffused with an indescribable backward feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flap to the tent was lifted open and a man and woman walked in. The man was tall, stalwart, and extremely robust. His muscles seemed like numerous rocks, causing him to be filled with extreme explosive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the woman had a tall and well proportioned body, a gorgeous appearance, and a capable bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the beautiful little girl from before, both of them wore beast skin clothes, and the man carried a pitch black bow made from a beast horn, whereas the woman’s waist had a whip made of the tendon of a beast coiled around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, both of them were figures that possessed martial prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw these two people, Chen Xi instantly knew that the Meng Wei and Mo Ya the little girl spoke of was probably the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re awake.” Meng Wei walked forward with large strides, and a wisp of joy appeared on his rough and manly face as he looked at Chen Xi who’d opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! He has already wasted so much of our food and medicinal material! If he still didn’t wake up, then even if the Lord Priest blames me, I’ll surely kill him!” Mo Ya grunted coldly. Her eyes were filled with hostility as she looked at Chen Xi, and she didn’t conceal her detest at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wants to kill me just for the sake of food and medicinal materials?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he heard such words in the past, he would surely feel that it was unbelievable. After all, cultivators like him didn’t need food to fill their stomachs, and merely absorbing spirit energy was sufficient for them to live for a long time. Even if they were injured, they practically didn’t require any ordinary medicinal materials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, as he looked at Mo Ya’s serious and murderous expression, he faintly felt that perhaps food and medicinal materials were related to their lives and survival. This caused him to have a deeper feeling that the place he’d appeared in this time seemed to be completely different from the places he was familiar with in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo Ya, that’s enough!” Meng Wei frowned as he reprimanded Mo Ya in a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya remained indifferent, nor did the hostility on her face disperse in the slightest, and she was stubborn and unyielding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Chen Xi met Meng Wei and Mo Ya. The atmosphere was awkward, and it couldn’t be considered to be a happy meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another seven days passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had already recovered a trace of strength and was barely able to stand up. But the violent pain in his entire body still remained, whereas the severe damage and injuries within his body hadn’t taken a turn for the better in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. His Blackhole World didn’t exist anymore, whereas his body lacked vital blood. Moreover, his vitality had practically dried up, so it was utterly insufficient to allow him to cultivate and recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing that he felt fortunate about was the Dark Parasol sapling still remained within his Dantian and emanated Immortal Energy that gradually repaired his broken veins, tendons, and bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He believed that it wouldn’t be long before he would be entirely capable of moving about like normal. But it was exceedingly difficult to recover his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Blackhole World had been blasted apart by Bing Shitian’s strike, and it had shattered to the point of not existing. It was equivalent to having his Dao Foundation destroyed, and he was utterly incapable of cultivating in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless he was capable of reconstructing his Dao Foundation and condensing a new Blackhole World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, since the ancient times until now, after a cultivator’s Dao Foundation was destroyed, there had practically been no cultivator that was capable of reconstructing it, and it was impossible to find a precedent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too difficult because the Dao Foundation was the foundation of a cultivator to establish himself in the heavens and the earth. It was a foundation that was established since the first step one took on the road of cultivation. So once it was destroyed, repairing it wasn’t as easy as it sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi gnashed his teeth with hatred, and his expression was extremely gloomy as he sensed the state of his body. All of this was caused by Bing Shitian, and he would surely repay it tenfold in the future!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he started cultivating until now, he’d never hated someone so madly, and if it wasn’t for the tiny cauldron’s assistance at the last moment, he would have almost perished on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Do you think you can seize Xiuyi back by destroying my Dao Foundation?! Don’t even dream about it! So long as I’m alive, I, Chen Xi, will surely be able to rebuild myself and ascend the Grand Dao once more!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trace of ruthlessness flashed within Chen Xi’s eyes, and he was matchlessly firm. It was absolutely impossible to make him become dejected and accept this fate just like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and tried hard to calm himself down before standing up and walking out of the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past few days, he’d understood from Meng Wei that this place was called Ninth Hell, and it was an extremely unfamiliar place to him. Even the Dark Reverie Manual didn’t have any description of Ninth Hell, and it seemed like a forgotten place.</span></p>

Merely this method of address allowed Chen Xi to perceive an unusual feeling from them.</span></p>

They would head forward a few thousands of kilometers every single day, and they would only leave a few hours in between for them to eat and rest.</span></p>

He seemed to be the leader of this group and possessed rather great authority. He was strong, valiant, and deeply received the respect and support of others.</span></p>

How many times have I said it? Your strength must be condensed as if it was one and exerted swiftly like a bolt of lightning before withdrawn in a similar fashion. Only in this way would all of you be able to cultivate to the realm of being able to freely control your strength!”</span></p>

Xiao Yan, come back here! You’re not allowed to send food and medicinal materials to that trash ever again!” After a short moment, Chen Xi was suddenly jolted awake by a berating voice. When he raised his eyes to look over, he saw that Xiao Yan was holding a large bowl of steaming medicinal soup with both her hands while walking over towards him from afar.</span></p>

We’ve already wasted too much food and medicinal materials. Could it be that you want all our clansmen to journey on with empty stomachs? Could it be you want our injured clansmen to lose their lives in the end because there are no medicinal materials to treat them?”</span></p>
