Based on the outline of his figure, he was probably a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Chen Xi’s gaze met the eyes of this mysterious person, he practically instantly noticed and lowered his head to sweep his gaze at Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi’s felt as if he’d fallen into a pitch black and bottomless abyss, and he felt a feeling of helplessness as if he was on the verge of suffocation, causing him to practically instinctively move his gaze away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, his back was already drenched in cold sweat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He finally recalled who this person was. While he was moving through the wilderness from Golden Mulberry Village to Crimson Swallow City, he’d met this black robed man once. At that time, the black robed man had merely emanated a strand of will, and it almost dragged him into a boundless abyss. If it wasn’t for him restraining his aura with all his might, he would have absolutely perished on that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, he’d roughly determined that the black robed man was absolutely a true Heavenly Immortal or even higher!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But never had he imagined that such a great figure would actually appear here abruptly and rescue Nan Xiuchong from Liang Bing’s hands.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that they’re together?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden appearance of the black robed man shocked everyone on the terrace to the point their eyes squinted. Some cowardly guests had already started fleeing silently, and in next to no time, only Liang Bing, Chen Xi, Teng Lan, Luo Zixuan, and the others remained on the terrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was with Feng Luyang, they were brought over to stand behind Teng Lan with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, after he rescued Nan Xiuchong, the black clothed man stood with his hands behind his back and stood before Luo Zixuan while remaining silent. Only his icy cold and gloomy eyes frequently swept towards Liang Bing and Teng Lan while faintly containing vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An expert at the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Looks like you’ve spent a great amount of effort this time, Luo Zixuan.” Liang Bing swept the black robed man with her gaze, and her expression was indifferent as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! It couldn’t be helped. I had no choice but to spend some effort for the sake of marrying you. Moreover, this is a good way to show my sincerity.” Luo Zixuan grunted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, you forgot that this is the territory of my Liang Clan, and it isn’t your Demon Forefather County. If I want to make all of you stay behind forever, then no one is capable of stopping me.” Liang Bing spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But you’ll surely have to pay a great price.” Luo Zixuan sneered as he said, “The Grand Deduction Tower is opening in four days, so would you dare do that at this critical moment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing went silent for a long time before she raised her eyes to stare at Luo Zixuan, and she didn’t conceal the detest and killing intent in her eyes at all as she said, “I’ll give all of you a chance. Leave the Eastern Emperor County immediately. Don’t force my hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zixuan wasn’t surprised in the slightest when he heard this, and he said unhurriedly, “I suggest that it’s best that you agree to marry me. Presently, the Gu Clan and Yin Clan have already agreed to join forces with me, and there are many formidable seniors that lived in seclusion who are standing on my side. If you continue to resist stubbornly, it will only hurt our feelings. At that time, the consequences aren’t something that you can endure by yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Zixuan led Nan Xiuchong and the others to swagger off from the terrace behind the black robed man, and they vanished in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing stared fixedly at him until he left, and she muttered after a long time. “I suddenly feel slight regret that I didn’t kill that bastard right at the beginning earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Teng Lan frowned while a trace of a pained expression suffused his eyes, and he said, “Eldest Young Miss, you’ve already done very well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The situation is very bad. Based on the information I received, Luo Zixuan has at least three or more Mysterious Immortal Realm experts on his side, and if he joins forces with the Gu Clan and Yin Clan, then the outcome is impossible to determine.” Liang Bing shook her head. At this moment, this young woman that possessed an extremely decisive and resolute imposing aura couldn’t help but reveal a trace of weakness between her brows. Even though it only flashed momentarily, Chen Xi was able to discern that due to how grim the situation was, she wasn’t as relaxed as she seemed on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the black robed man appeared earlier, Chen Xi didn’t have room to interrupt. After all, a collision of that level was far from something someone that was all alone like him could interfere in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, he couldn’t refrain from asking. “Is the Grand Deduction Tower very dangerous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing was stunned and seemed to be unwilling to speak about it as she said, “You’ll know when the time comes. It can’t be considered to be very dangerous while ascending the tower, and it only tests one’s understanding of the Dao of Talismans. The danger comes after you ascend the top of the tower.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, her expression suddenly turned serious while her bearing returned to her chilly and overbearing appearance from before, and she glanced coldly at the nearby Feng Luyang and said, “Young Master Feng, your display today really disappointed me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Luyang’s expression instantly started changing indeterminately. Only now did he notice that Liang Bing seemed to have found out about all his actions against Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He said hastily, “A’Bing, listen to me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing waved her hand and interrupted him. “You leave my Eastern Emperor County now as well. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, she brought Teng Lan and Chen Xi along as she transformed into a flowing light that vanished on the terrace, leaving Feng Luyang and his two servants all alone there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had he imagined that Liang Bing would actually be so ruthless and simply intended to cut off all ties with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that I was wrong earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Isn’t he just a little fellow at the Nether Transformation Realm? Who would have known that his combat strength is so shocking? If I knew earlier, would I pressure him like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Luyang had a bellyful of grievance yet nowhere to vent it, and he felt more infuriated the more he thought about it, causing his handsome face to warp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, what should we do next?” Wen Jiu asked carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go! We’re leaving Eastern Emperor County!” Feng Luyang gnashed his teeth and said, “Since Liang Bing is so ruthless, then she can’t blame me for being heartless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he kicked the table before him flying, and then soared up into the sky with a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Jiu and Wen Peng glanced at each other, and they sighed in their hearts as they hurriedly chased after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them faintly sensed that the Young Master would probably hate Liang Bing as well after experiencing this incident, and it might even cause him to become enemies with her.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Teng Lan hesitated for a very long time before he asked. “Eldest Young Miss, Feng Luyang is the disciple of the Immortal Dimension’s Sublime Glow Mountain’s Feng Clan after all, and the relationship of their clan with our Liang Clan is very deep. Doing this seems to be slightly…”</span></p>

You don’t have to worry about our safety.”</span></p>

But he knew very well that it was convincing because these words were spoken by Liang Bing. After all, she was a Mysterious Immortal that was even more formidable than a Heavenly Immortal, so she naturally had the qualifications to speak these words.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Moreover, she even had an expert with unfathomable strength like Teng Lan following by her side, yet she was still full of worry.</span></p>

Such a magnificent formation caused even Chen Xi to feel a wave of horror.</span></p>

Even though his cultivation couldn’t improve in the slightest, he’d obtained a great deal of Virtue Energy.</span></p>

It emitted a rhythm thumping that seemed as if an even stronger heart had been born in the Heart Core.</span></p>

They supplemented each other and were extremely miraculous.</span></p>

She was like a bloomed black rose, chilly and orderly, and it aroused indescribable coldness in the hearts of others.</span></p>

It wasn’t like those tight and strange clothes that she wore before. Those clothes had a skirt that only tightly covered her slender and alluring thighs, and they would be extremely inconvenient in battle.</span></p>

She waved her white hand and withdrew the Cosmic Grade Immortal Artifact, the Silverlight Shuttle, and then they transformed into a wisp of silver light that penetrated through the layers of space and vanished in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
