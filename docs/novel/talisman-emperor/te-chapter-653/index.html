 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, it was an extremely rare and precious treasure, so even though the forces of the Flameox Clan were many, they weren’t afraid because how could they possibly watch idly by and let such a fortune slip by?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Jiang Wei is amazing!” The experts of the Flameox Clan instantly erupted with cheers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before the robust young man, Jiang Wei, could take the Grand Dao Fragment, countless experts suddenly charged out from all directions, and they tore through the sky as they charged over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some attacked Jiang Wei while some directly charged towards the Grand Dao Fragment, the scene was instantly in chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death! All of you are courting death!” Jiang Wei was blazing with rage as he never expected that these bastards would actually aim their sights at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But for the sake of this Grand Dao Fragment, everyone present had even disregarded their lives. So they didn’t care about his threats and carried fearless expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Jiang Wei to be even more furious. His roars shook the sky as flames soared from his entire body, and he intended to kill these bastards that took advantage of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Magic treasures flew about as Dao Arts raged, and blazing rays of light shot out into the surroundings. Shrill cries echoed out occasionally while severed limbs and blood sprayed all over the sky, and they fought to the point the sun and the moon dimmed in comparison and it was an extremely horrifying scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the true scene of the cultivation world, brutal and bloody. For the sake of a treasure they dreamt of, every single person was able to bet their lives and slaughter madly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when faced with this temptation, there was a small group of people that maintained their calm and stood outside the battlefield while watching coldly because they intended to reap the final reward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone must be careful of that kid. He seems to be all alone, but he poses a great threat to us.” Someone glanced at Chen Xi, and his eyeballs spun as he spoke gloomily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, he was driving a wedge between everyone and Chen Xi, and even an idiot would be able to discern it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But to Chen Xi’s surprise, along with this person finishing what he said, the others really shot hostile gazes at him, and they seemed as if they’d taken him to be their greatest enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like my existence is the greatest threat in their hearts. They do really look highly upon me…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi rubbed his nose yet was completely unconcerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the battlefield, the battle was already approaching its end. The Grand Dao Fragment still floated there, yet the people that participated in the battle for it had almost perished completely. Even the Flameox Clan’s experts that possessed a large force only had a few people remaining, and they were bathed in blood while still in battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the eyes of those people in the surroundings that still hadn’t moved lit up, and they held their breaths in concentration while accumulating forces, causing them to seem like wild beasts hidden in the darkness that were about to make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wave of the sound of air being torn apart could be faintly heard from extremely far away in the sky, and it was like the sound of imminent death. It caused the hearts of everyone present to constrict as they understood a large group of experts would rush over in a short moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became anxious, and the people who were locked in battle started to fight desperately and with all their strength, whereas those who were watching coldly from the sidelines couldn’t help but become restless to join the fray. The atmosphere became horrifying and strained, and it almost caused them to be unable to catch their breaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi similarly understood that if he continued delaying, then something unexpected might occur.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he suddenly made a move in the next moment. He didn’t soar into the sky nor leave the spot he stood on, and he just stretched out his hand and gestured towards the Grand Dao Fragment in midair.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if he was greeting someone, and it seemed to be extremely strange and unexpected in this strained and horrifying atmosphere, causing all the people that were on guard against Chen Xi since a long time ago to be unable to refrain from being stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s this fellow trying to do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people even thought that Chen Xi was trying to play some tricks and sought to draw their attention away. They’d seen this sort of little tricks numerous times as they wandered throughout the world, so how could they fall for it? All of them revealed expressions of disdain and looked at Chen Xi as if they were looking at an idiot.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the next moment, a scene that caused all of them to be astounded appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Dao Fragment that had always been floating on the spot in midair actually seemed as if it was summoned and transformed into a golden ray of light that flashed towards Chen Xi like a bolt of lightning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their eyeballs almost fell out, and they seemed as if they saw a ghost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because it was too sudden, all of them only woke up from what seemed like a dream when the Grand Dao Fragment fell into Chen Xi’s hand, and they reacted to what had happened. But when they looked at Chen Xi once more, he’d already vanished a long time ago, and he seemed as if he’d evaporated into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck! What the fuck is going on?” Someone couldn’t refrain from cursing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! Give me back that Grand Dao Fragment!” Someone was shocked and furious as his roar shook the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve been tricked… Motherfucker! We’ve actually been tricked!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In midair, the expert of the Flameox Clan, Jiang Wei, was angered to the point of almost spitting blood. He finally understood that Chen Xi didn’t give up on the Grand Dao Fragment earlier, but had made preparations a long time ago and was waiting to draw in the net!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the reason this bastard had waited to make a move until now was because he wanted to see all of them kill each other and rely on the strength of others to strike a heavy blow to the Flameox Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the scarce few companions that remained by his size, Jiang Wei was angered to the point his eyes turned red and his insides almost exploded. He’d worked hard and fought for so long, yet came back empty-handed in the end, and even more than half of his companions had died. How could he accept such an outcome?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! I’ll surely kill you! Surely!” Jiang Wei howled with anger, and he seemed like a mad ox that was on the verge of going berserk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, he actually dared to play a trick on all of us. We must kill this detestable bastard!” The others chimed in successively. They gnashed their teeth while their eyes blazed with flames, and they simply hated Chen Xi to the bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I saw him fleeing towards that direction earlier.” Someone spoke out abruptly.</span></p>

All of them had murderous looks on their face and transformed their sorrow into motivation as they turned into numerous streaks that pursued towards the direction Chen Xi left.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people came from different powers and had even fought and killed each other, causing them to seem like mortal enemies. However, they’d actually joined forces because of Chen Xi!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious from this that one’s eyes would really be blinded with rage sometimes, and it would cause one to do some absurd things.</span></p>

They formed a formidable array that seethed with killing intent, and everywhere they passed, they shocked the cultivators on their path to the point of avoiding them and being puzzled towards what had happened.</span></p>

When he was breaking through the barrier in the surroundings of the Grand Dao Fragment with the Wings of Disruption earlier, he’d already noticed that the piece of charred wood that was rooted within his Blackhole World was actually able to form a slight strange fluctuation with the Grand Dao Fragment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this fluctuation that he noticed the Grand Dao Fragment would charge into his embrace without the slightest hesitation with just a single thought from him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It felt as if he’d transformed into the parent of the Grand Dao Fragment, and it was extremely miraculous.</span></p>

Presently, I possess a strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul, so I naturally have an extremely great force of attraction to this Grand Dao Fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, Chen Xi understood the reason behind what had happened, and he was extremely excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because if it was like this, then he was entirely capable of relying on this ability that was different from everyone else to obtain Grand Dao Fragments in a more relaxed and easy way!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just think about it, everyone else went through great troubles and experienced horrifying battles to obtain a Grand Dao Fragment with great difficulty, whereas he utterly didn’t have to go through so much trouble. He only had to wave his hand and the Grand Dao Fragment would obediently comply and fall into his palm. It was simply easier than drinking cold water, so who wouldn’t be excited by such a special ability?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? It has actually started to be refined and fused!” In the next moment, Chen Xi was shocked as he noticed the shocking changes that were occurring within his Blackhole World.</span></p>

At the instant it fell into his hand at that moment, it bore into the Blackhole World within his body and attached itself onto the sapling of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like a small sun that hung on the edge of a branch, and it emitted a boundless golden glow that illuminated the entire Blackhole World.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, at this moment, this Grand Dao Fragment had actually started to break down and melt like a rain of light that sprayed down onto the stars, moon, sun, mountains, rivers, plants… It completely fused into the entire Blackhole World.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its speed of fusing was so swift that it was simply like ice fusing into water.</span></p>

It was unlike him who was actually able to completely refine and absorb it within 10 minutes!</span></p>

It was full and flawless as if he was completely capable of turning stone into gold so long as he was willing!</span></p>

Even his Blackhole World had doubled in size and was covered in a brilliant golden color that was extremely dazzling. It was like a fort made from metal, and it emitted a fierce and solid aura that was majestic and brilliant.</span></p>

By relying on the marvelous ability of the Dark Parasol sapling, I’m entirely capable of obtaining even more Grand Dao Fragments, and that would mean that my strength will repeatedly multiply and rise explosively…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, a thought inadvertently flashed past Chen Xi’s mind, and then he was unable to restrain this impulse and transformed into a ray of light that left the Region of Metal swiftly. He intended to carry out a huge undertaking!</span></p>
