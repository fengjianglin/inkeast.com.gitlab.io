All the Elite Disciples from the East Radiance Peak, West Radiance Peak, South Radiance Peak, and North Radiance Peak would compete for the five positions to become Seed Disciples.</span></p>

People swarmed and surged about like tides, and all of them were discussing the upcoming Peak Trials.</span></p>

But, they didn’t leave and stood far away in the distance instead while waiting with raised heads because they wanted to witness the graceful bearing of the top Elite Disciples as well.</span></p>

On the first day of entering the sect, he’d bashed Du Xuan’s younger brother, ascended the top of the lotus platform to become the first person to ascend it in a few thousand years, and then he faced Elder Yue Chi directly, forced Du Xuan to kneel, contributed 49 Dao Art inheritances, and so on and so forth.</span></p>

He entered the sect on the same day as Chen Xi, and he’d called Ming Yan. Supposedly, he obtained a Dao Art within the lotus platform as well, and he possesses extremely shocking natural talent.</span></p>

Everyone anticipated the Peak Trials this time more and more.</span></p>

Along with the passage of time and the approaching of the Peak Trials, they couldn’t help but be anxious in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, Chen Xi will surely come.” The nearby Ling Bai sat lazily on Qing Yu’s shoulder as he held a sweet and juicy spirit peach that was bigger than himself with two hands, and he ate it with large bites and revealed a leisurely and carefree appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Kui sat on Qing Yu’s other shoulder and similar held a spirit peach that he was nibbling and eating. Obviously, he was more interested with the spirit peach than the Peak Trials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at the two little fellow’s carefree appearances, Huo Molei and the others were speechless and were even more anxious in their hearts.</span></p>

It turned out that the number one Elite Disciple in the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement from the South Radiance Peak, Xia Yu, had arrived. He still wore rough linen clothes, and his expression was still firm and sedate when being center of attention. He seemed like someone that wasn’t involved with what was happening, and he gave of the feeling of being firm like a rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eh, this fellow is quite formidable.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, when body refiners attained the Nether Transformation Realm, their bodies would already attain an unimaginable state, and they were capable of utilizing their Blood Essence and Soul Core to create an External Avatar that possessed an equal combat strength with the true body, causing it to be extremely terrifying when used in battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, no matter if it was body refiners or qi refiners, once they attained the Nether Transformation Realm, then both their cultivation and the essence of their vitality would undergo a complete and qualitative transformation, and they would belong to the ranks of ‘great’ cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the clamorous voices suddenly quieted down, and it became perfectly silent while the gazes of everyone shot towards the same direction in unison.</span></p>

They hadn’t arrived, yet strands of faint fragrance that refreshed the heart had suffused the air and caused others to be intoxicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were the female disciples of the North Radiance Peak. Every single one of them was graceful, charming, and gorgeous, yet the most striking was the young woman in the lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She possessed a classical and gorgeous appearance, eyes that shone like jade, and a peerlessly beautiful pair of red lips. Her skin was white, supple, and crystalline, while her beautiful hair flowed down like a waterfall, and she had an ample and jade white forehead. She was beautiful and ethereal to the point of seeming otherworldly, and she was like a celestial maiden that had fluttered down from the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her figure possessed a shocking allure. A pair of slender and long legs, a slim waist that a single arm could wrap around, a plump chest, and a snow white and long neck, and her curvy figure revealed an extremely attractive charm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was naturally the number one female disciple of the North Radiance Peak, An Wei. The lead figure amongst the five great Elite Disciples, and the deserving number one Elite Disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Annoying. It’s only a woman, what’s there to get excited over?” As he looked at everyone present that were dumbstruck, Ling Bai couldn’t but mutter endlessly in a light voice. He was annoyed the most by women, and since he followed by Chen Xi’s side, he felt extreme dislike towards all the women that came in contact with Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because his master had died at the hand of a woman of unparalleled beauty. This caused him to have an extremely detesting attitude towards these strange existences called women.</span></p>

No matter how great Senior Sister An Wei is, she’s still a woman. Look at all of you, you seem as if you’ve never seen a woman!” When they saw the attention of all these male disciples descending onto An Wei, it caused the female disciples that had obviously dressed themselves meticulously to be extremely displeased, and they couldn’t help but mutter sourly with a soft voice.</span></p>

Moreover, its clear sound suppressed all the clamorous noise here.</span></p>

His gaze was like bolts of lightning, and he was peerlessly mighty and possessed a majestic imposing manner. He was precisely Elder Lie Peng who specialized in the matters of the enforcement of punishment in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, and he was called as an Enforcement Elder as well.</span></p>

The final five Elite Disciples that’re able to hold their positions on the combat ring while facing all challenges will be selected as Seed Disciples!” Yue Chi’s voice drifted through the heavens and the earth, and it entered clearly into the ears of everyone. “But I have to specially remind everyone that once the time for the Peak Trials to begin arrives, Elite Disciples that still haven’t arrived at True Martial Peak will have their qualifications to participate in the Peak Trials this time stripped away!”</span></p>

That would truly be too disappointing…</span></p>
