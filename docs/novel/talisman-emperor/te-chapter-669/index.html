He looked at the myriad of doors in his surroundings for a good while before he asked. “Senior, which door do you think I should choose?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After staying silent for a short while, the tiny cauldron didn’t answer him but asked another question in reply. “Do you know how many cultivators have come here since the primeval times until now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned and didn’t know how to answer this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The primeval times were too far away after all, and it was far to the point of seeming like a legend. According to legend, it was a period of time where the chaos had just been split apart and the three dimensions had just been established, and it was a desolate and chaotic scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, everything in the world was born with intelligence. Fiendgods roamed freely while the saints fought for supremacy, and they created numerous myths that shook the heavens and the earth. Numerous supreme and almighty figures of the three dimensions were born during that period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dark Parasol’s Abyss was precisely formed from a divine tree in the primeval times that linked the Immortal Dimension and the Mortal Dimension, and it was already a matter of countless years ago. No one was able to be sure exactly how many living beings had stepped foot within it in the innumerable years of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, there are very few because since the primeval times until now, the Dark Parasol’s Abyss has only appeared three times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The first time it appeared was during the primeval times. At that time, a calamity of divine punishment that affected the three dimensions had erupted, causing the three dimensions to fall into great chaos, and the gods perished and the saints fell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The second time it appeared just happened to be when the calamity of the Fiendgods descended. At that time, all the Fiendgods that roamed freely throughout the ages and looked down upon the world suffered calamity, and they were completely obliterated in the annals of history. After that time, a true descendant of the Fiendgods couldn’t be found any longer in the entire world. That period of time was called the Primordial Era, and it’s a million years from the primeval times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The third time it appeared was 10,000 years ago. But it only appeared for a short moment of less than six hours before strangely vanishing, and it actually caused everyone to be unable to enter it. According to rumor, a great figure that had ascended to the end of the path of the Dao had descended here, and he personally sealed up the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now, it’s the fourth time the Dark Parasol’s Abyss appeared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tiny cauldron’s voice was flat and emotionless as if it was narrating an unimportant and trivial matter, and it rose slowly within Chen Xi’s heart before curling up and dispersing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when these words entered into Chen Xi’s ears, they weren’t inferior to a thunderclap, and they caused his mind to shake before a tempestuous storm arose within it. He was unable to calm down his feelings for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first time the Dark Parasol’s Abyss appeared, a calamity of divine punishment descended onto the three dimensions, causing the gods to perish and the saints to fall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second time it appeared, the calamity of the Fiendgods descended to the three dimensions, and the peerlessly formidable Fiendgod Clan were henceforth obliterated from the annals of time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third time it appeared, even though it didn’t draw down a great calamity, yet a great figure had descended and sealed it up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, it was the fourth time the Dark Parasol’s Abyss appeared. What does this mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wouldn’t be… that it’s related to the upheaval of the three dimensions, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, even with Chen Xi’s level of composure, he couldn’t help but gasp and feel his scalp go slightly numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first two times caused the gods to perish, saints to fall, and the Fiendgod Clan to be obliterated. Then what about this time? What sort of terrifying unexpected event would occur?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t dare imagine any further. Even existences with abilities that reached the heavens like the gods, saints, and Fiendgods were unable to avoid the successive calamities that struck the three dimensions, let alone the myriad of living beings in the three dimensions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do I feel that the Dark Parasol’s Abyss is like the source of calamity, and every time it appears, it’s accompanied by an upheaval of the three dimensions. Is it too unbelievable...?” Chen Xi muttered. This sort of thing seemed to be extremely far away from him, yet when it really occurred, who could guarantee that he wouldn’t be affected?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But after that, he suddenly realized something. At this moment, he was only a step away from the Door of Profundity, so why did the tiny cauldron suddenly tell him something like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once the time comes, you’ll naturally understand.” The tiny cauldron seemed to have seen through Chen Xi’s thoughts, and it said something that was extremely strange, “Because you’re different from others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words seemed to be very normal yet when they were spoken by the tiny cauldron, it caused Chen Xi to have the feeling that it was slightly unusual. This was an indescribable feeling that he felt was impossible to explain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really wanted to ask which part of him was different than others. But he forcefully restrained himself in the end. He knew that if the tiny cauldron wasn’t willing, then even if he continued asking, he would probably not get any answers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dark Parasol’s Abyss, the great chaos of the three dimensions… Saying that I’m different from others for no reason or rhyme. It’s truly difficult to comprehend.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed lightly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. With the protection of the Dark Parasol sapling, you can casually select any one of these doors to enter, and if you go forward continuously, you’ll be able to arrive at the core area of the Divine Palace of Creation…” The tiny cauldron guided. “As for the so-called inheritance of the exalted expert, I’m unable to guide you towards that. After all, I’m only able to sense the existence of the Chaotic Divine Crystal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and exerted great effort to completely recover his senses before he nodded and casually choose one of the doors, and then he flashed towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu~ Wu~ Wu~</span></p>

These images roared ferociously and emitted an oppressive force that felt like a mountain pressing down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A shocking scene appeared. Those blade vortexes and images of ghastly beings seemed as if they encountered the arrival of an emperor, and they moved aside successively before dispersing into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that the aura of chaos that coiled around the passageway was dispersed completely, causing his field of vision to instantly open up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did Chen Xi notice that the walls of the passageway were actually constructed completely out of the essence of the five elements mixed with various types of strange divine rocks, and they were densely covered with countless restrictions. Even the ground was paved with various natural treasures of the heavens and the earth that were branded with mysterious restrictions, and they emanated horrifying auras.</span></p>
