 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Chen Haotian’s voice resounded, both Xuanyuan Tong and Zuoqiu Sheng instantly shut their mouths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other old figures seated in the hall understood completely in their hearts. They were very well aware that there was old enmity between Xuanyuan Tong and Zuoqiu Sheng. In all these years of the past until now, conflict had erupted between them on many occasions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the Xuanyuan Clan and Zuoqiu Clan stood behind them respectively, it caused the relationship between these two clans to be rather tense, and they faintly showed signs of turning hostile against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, this was Dao Emperor Academy, and there were many seniors holding down the fort here, otherwise, the Pill Reserve would probably be unable to accommodate the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since the matter has come to this, what does Brother Chen think our next move should be?” said Mo Linghai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Haotian frowned and pondered deeply for a long time before he said, “Nevermind. It’s already too late to rescind the assignment now. The important matter at hand is to find a way to repair the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Tong said, “My cousin brother, Xuanyuan Pojun, has already returned to the clan. Perhaps it won’t be long before he’ll be able to invite some supreme talisman formation grandmasters over to repair the cauldron along with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Haotian shook his head and said, “I’m afraid that it won’t work. There are many supreme talisman formation grandmasters amongst us here, yet aren’t we helpless towards restoring the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, he walked forward to stand before the cauldron and stared at it. He said, “The key to the problem is the talisman formation diagram within the cauldron.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others shot their gazes towards the cauldron when they heard this, and they rather agreed with Chen Haotian’s opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron was personally created by the primeval Dao Emperor, and the talisman formation diagrams within it were mysterious, complicated, and extremely rare. Even though they were supreme talisman formation grandmasters, yet none of them had seen such talisman formation diagrams in their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They’d studied it bitterly and tried to break down the profundities within it and deduce them. However, they came up empty handed in the end. If it wasn’t for that, they wouldn’t have become anxious to such an extent in these past few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, I suspect that only…that mysterious sect is able to recognize the talisman formation diagrams within the cauldron.” Mo Lanhai seemed to have thought of something, and a wisp of a strange expression suffused his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the end, he didn’t speak that name, and he used the words ‘mysterious sect’ as a replacement instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the others seemed to have understood something when they heard this, and they revealed strange expressions as well. It seemed to be expressions of respect and wonder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master.” Right at this moment, a respectful voice sounded out abruptly from outside the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone moved their gazes and saw a black clothed young man standing outside the hall. He had a dignified and upright bearing, and all of them recognized him as the disciple that cultivated in the Dao of Pills by Chen Haotian’s side, Ling Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?” Chen Haotian frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Su said hurriedly, “News that caused quite a big commotion came from the Assignment Mountain just moments ago, and I felt that it was necessary to be reported to Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he gave an account of everything that had occurred earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A supreme talisman formation grandmaster?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He completed ninety assignments in the Dao of Talismans within twelve hours?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of those assignments were at an outstanding level of completion or above?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they finished listening to all of this, all the seniors within the hall weren’t able to maintain their calm any longer, and all of them exclaimed with shock and were slightly surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this true?” Xuanyuan Tong stood up and asked in a slightly excited manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is. I personally verified it before coming here. However, I’m unable to determine Chen Xi’s identity.” As he finished speaking, Ling Su was slightly hesitant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, all the others in the hall came to a sudden understanding.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right, is there even a supreme talisman formation grandmaster in the entire academy called Chen Xi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need to continue guessing. If this matter is true, then it’s definitely the first amongst the new students that were just recruited into the academy, Chen Xi.” Chen Haotian spoke while a wisp of a strange expression slipped past his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first amongst the new students?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the others instantly came to an understanding. They were naturally clearly aware who the first amongst the new students this year was, because since the ancient times until now, besides Yun Fusheng whose whereabouts were unknown, only Chen Xi had obtained a Praise of the Gods that exceeded the level of Resonance of the Heavens and the Earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason they hadn’t thought of him earlier was that Chen Xi was only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, and they were truly unable to link him together with a supreme talisman formation grandmaster. Even if it was this moment, they still felt slight doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially Zuoqiu Sheng, his expression froze slightly when he heard the words Chen Xi, and then the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl into an imperceptible arc. He seemed to be revealing ridicule and disdain, yet it also seemed like hatred and contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in next to no time, his expression recovered its calm, and he said, “Even if this Chen Xi is a supreme talisman formation grandmaster, so what about it? Could it be that all of you think a young man at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm like him is capable of restoring the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as these words were spoken, many of the others went silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just think about it, even many of the supreme talisman formation grandmasters of the academy were helpless, so how could a young man possibly be able to accomplish it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, since Chen Xi was able to accomplish this at such a young age, then he surely possesses unique attainments in the Dao of Talismans. I’ll go look for him right now. If he’s able to solve this problem, then no matter what sort of price I have to pay, I, Xuanyuan Tong, won’t even frown at it.” Xuanyuan Tong suddenly stood up and intended to leave the hall as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the others shook their heads and sighed lightly when they saw this. How could they be unable to perceive that Xuanyuan Tong was like someone who was critically ill and was willing to turn to any doctor he could find. Obviously, he was a bit too impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait!” Chen Haotian stopped Xuanyuan Tong. “Since the assignment has already been issued, then that little fellow has definitely seen it. If he’s able to solve it, then how could he remain indifferent? The reward for that assignment is an entire 800,000 Starpoints. Any new student would probably be unable to resist such temptation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Tong was stunned, and then his expression instantly dimmed down greatly as he sighed. “Then…what exactly should we do? Could it be that we should just continue waiting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice revealed a wisp of dejection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The damage suffered by the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron was related to Xuanyuan Tong’s cousin brother, Xuanyuan Pojun, so he naturally couldn’t sit idly by and remain indifferent. It was precisely because he was concerned about this matter that he seemed to be slightly anxious and worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nevermind. I have to try no matter what. Even if the hope of success is extremely tiny, it’s still better than having no hope at all…” Xuanyuan Tong muttered as he walked out of the hall, and he seemed as if he’d been possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others let out another wave of sighs when they saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zuoqiu Sheng eyes had a wisp of ridicule that flashed through its depths.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You’re dreaming of restoring the cauldron with that kid’s little ability? Alright, if you, Xuanyuan Tong, are able to drag him down as well, then so long as he fails, I’ll have an opportunity to teach him a good lesson as well!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The first amongst the new students is a supreme talisman formation grandmaster?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly. Amongst all the instructors and students in the entire academy, only he’s named Chen Xi. So besides him, who else could have been the madman that swept through ninety assignments in the Dao of Talismans within twelve hours?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My god! How extraordinary! I remember that he’s only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I should make friends with him if I have the chance. Such a young supreme talisman formation grandmaster is rarely seen…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this day, a piece of news was spread from Assignment Mountain, and it spread throughout the entirety of Dao Emperor Academy as if it had grown wings, whereas, Chen Xi’s name gradually appeared within the topics of discussion of numerous students and instructors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had expected that the first amongst the new students this year would actually be so formidable. He was only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm in cultivation, yet he’d obtained a Praise of the Gods that exceeded the level of the Resonance of the Heavens and the Earth, and he himself was even a supreme talisman formation grandmaster. All of this was so dazzling, and it was impossible for others to overlook.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vastcloud Mountain, Lucky Rain Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beautiful figure tore through the sky and arrived her. Her clear eyes swept the surroundings &nbsp;before it descended onto the abode on the peak, and then she formed a cone with her hands before she cried out in a clear voice. “Hey, are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her airy voice reverberated through the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the abode, Chen Xi who was in meditation opened his eyes while a wisp of helplessness suffused the corners of his mouth. He didn’t have to guess to know that it was A’xiu that had come looking for him because only A’xiu would address him with the word ‘hey.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, he’s stood up and walked out of the abode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of delight appeared on A’xiu’s clear and pure face when she saw Chen Xi’s tall figure emerge, and she leaped over to Chen Xi’s side before she pulled on his sleeve and chuckled. “Supreme talisman formation grandmaster, I have something I need to trouble you with. I wonder if you can help me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned. “Supreme talisman formation grandmaster?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu nodded solemnly and said, “Yes. Presently, the entire academy knows that you’re a supreme talisman formation grandmaster and a madman that madly swept through ninety assignments in the Dao of Talismans within twelve hours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was astounded, and then he came to an understanding.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I seem to have accepted and completed numerous assignments earlier. However, I don’t remember how long I spend to complete them or how many I completed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought up to here, his immortal sense entered the Violet Ribbon Starcrest. Surprisingly, he noticed that the Starpoints he possessed had already risen to a number of 168,000!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how calm Chen Xi was, his heart couldn’t help but thump fiercely at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, after he paid the fee of 1,000 Starpoints to verify his identity at Assignment Mountain yesterday, only a total of 8,000 Starpoints remained in his possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet &nbsp;one day later, he had an additional 160,000 Starpoints!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Chen Xi noticed that there was some information similar to a ‘statement’ within his Violet Ribbon Starcrest, and it clearly labelled the source and details of these Starpoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth twitched because he noticed that he should have obtained around 200,000 Starpoints, but in the end, the academy had forcefully deducted almost 20% in administration fees!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over 40,000 Starpoints were deducted… The academy is truly ruthless…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s expression became slightly strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong?” A’xiu looked at Chen Xi with a curious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s nothing.” Chen Xi returned to his senses and asked. “Right, what exactly do you need my help with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’xiu seemed to be slightly embarrassed when this was mentioned, yet she was unable to restrain herself in the end and said, “My third uncle, Xuanyuan Tong, came looking for me earlier. He said that he wants to trouble you to help restore the damaged talisman formation diagram of a treasure…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, A’xiu spoke in detail about everything related to the matter of the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this entire process, Chen Xi suddenly recalled that he seemed to have seen this assignment, and it seemed to require a supreme talisman formation grandmaster to accept it. Moreover, the reward of the assignment was 800,000 Starpoints…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, in the next moment, A’xiu said hatefully, “It was all done by that Zuoqiu Sheng. He spread the news of this by way of issuing an assignment, otherwise, my third uncle wouldn’t be in such a passive position!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Sheng?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s brows raised.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zuoqiu Clan again?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
