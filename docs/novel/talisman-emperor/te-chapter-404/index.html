 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This blade strike hadn’t slashed out yet already possessed such might, and even the Earthly Immortal Realm experts that watched the battle from afar revealed shocked expressions.</span></p>

This is the supreme ultimate move the Warlord used to sweep through the lands. All those years ago, he’d relied on this slash to kill a few tens of thousands of foreign cultivators, causing corpses to form mountains as blood flowed in rivers!”</span></p>

This strike can be said to be used in the best environment. The Devilbane Arena was refined by his Majesty by gathering the aura of battle from an ancient battlefield. When this strike struck out, it was filled with killing intent and the aura of battle converged upon it, causing its might to at least rise by 20%!”</span></p>

As soon as they saw the might contained within the strike of Su Chan’s, they instantly deduced that even if Chen Xi executed the sixth level of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, he would probably be unable to receive this strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the Warlord Huangfu Taiwu revealed a trace of a smile, and he felt that he did indeed not take Su Chan in all those years ago in vain. The talent displayed by this kid at this moment caused him to feel great pride.</span></p>

I’ll leave your corpse intact, otherwise, this strike will surely obliterate you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arrogant! Complacent!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with him finishing the last word, the air around Chen Xi shook and rumbled before shattering into powder, and it was like a peerless divine weapon was about to be unsheathe and slaughter the world!</span></p>

The sword move that contained the seventh level of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture ascended the arena in a shocking manner!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Martial Marquis couldn’t help but glance out of the corner of his eyes towards the sky high above, and he instantly noticed that Emperor Chu had already opened his eyes since an unknown time and revealed a trace of interest towards the battle in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He deeply concealed his strength without revealing it completely!” Qing Xiuyi, Zhao Qinghe, Huangfu Changtian, and the other top experts simultaneously had the same thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi, the most dazzling dark horse in the Allstar Meeting this time had overcome numerous obstacles all along the way and repeatedly obtained victories in battles. Up until now, he’d never lost in anything, yet most striking to all was that his strength increased along with the increase of his opponent’s strength, and his trump cards were concealed rather deeply, as if he would never reach a limit, so he could indeed be said to deeply conceal his strength without revealing it completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Su Chan’s Voidslaughter Annihilation Slash and Chen Xi’s seventh level Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture’s move collided with each other, and the destructive force that exploded out from this collision was like two erupting volcanos that emitted brilliant lights and surging rumbling. If it wasn’t for them being within the Devilbane Arena, merely the aftershock emitted from this strike was sufficient to obliterate the land in 500km of their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this scene, everyone in Silken City was dumbstruck, their hearts shook, and they were unable to calm down for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…actually blocked it?!” After a long time, the dust and smoke on the arena dissipated as Su Chan’s extremely shocked and furious explosive shout sounded out. At this moment, his clothes were tattered to the point he was in a slightly embarrassing situation and his countenance was slightly pale, but he didn’t seem to have suffered much of an injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opposite him, Chen Xi held his sword in his right hand, his azure clothes tattered extremely as well, yet his posture was extraordinary as before, and his expression didn’t have the slightest fluctuation and was completely calm and indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible! My Voidslaughter Annihilation Slash has already attained mastery. The combining of the Bloodsoul and Firmament Dao Insights has annihilated countless Bloodsoul Spirits, I don’t believe you can block all my attacks! Take this!” Su Chan’s eyes were red as he shouted out explosively and struck once more towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was something else Su Chan didn’t mention.

Unfortunately, once a slight flaw appears in one’s heart, it’s bound to be utilized by one’s opponent in such an extremely intense battle.” The other Earthly Immortal Realm experts felt extreme pity in their hearts as well.</span></p>

The blood red blade in Su Chan’s hand was directly blasted flying as the bones in his wrist shattered with a cracking sound, causing blood to spray out. Besides that, his entire body was blasted flying as his countenance went pale, and his appearance distorted from the intense pain.</span></p>

He understood that he’d acted impulsively and lost his head. But unfortunately, it was already too late now as Chen Xi had already arrived before him.</span></p>

The rules of this battle was that once one party admitted defeat, the other was disallowed from continuing. If anyone was to violate this rule, then Emperor Chu would directly annihilate the person!</span></p>

It was even to the extent that early on before the battle had begun, Chen Xi had already thought of how to deal with a situation like this. Right when Su Chan’s voice hadn’t finished resounding out, Chen Xi’s sea of consciousness rumbles as it swiftly struck out wish a shapeless Divine Sense attack that fiercely blasted towards Su Chan.</span></p>

It hurts! Chen Xi… How ruthless of you!”</span></p>
