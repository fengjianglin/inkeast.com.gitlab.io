 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit! Those two people are about to enter the secret realm!” Finally, someone noticed the movements of Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou and shouted out loudly, and it instantly alarmed everyone present at the scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present at the scene instantly reacted to what had happened. Chen Xi didn’t withdraw the Flaming Peacock Fan without the slightest hesitation earlier for the sake of deterring them, and it was instead for the sake of covering for his two companions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death!” A genius expert suddenly flashed out explosively from Qin Xiao’s group, and he withdrew two sharp flying swords that shot towards Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou like bolts of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flying swords were like bolts of lightning that tore through space while emitting sharp and ear piercing sonic booms, and it clearly displayed how swift the speed of the flying swords was. Perhaps it was incapable of instantly killing Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou, but its unparalleled speed was sufficient to stop their footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Xiao couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw this. Because the person who shot those swords out was Zhai Di. In the Darqin Dynasty, Zhai Di was famous for his first-rate reaction speed and the speed of his flying swords, and his ability to cope with sudden events was something that caused even Qin Xiao to feel embarrassed of his inferiority.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So when he saw Zhai Di make a move, he’d already concluded that Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou would be stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qin Xiao’s pupils constricted in the next moment. Suddenly, a pitch black and simple sword appeared in Chen Xi’s right hand, and it fiercely slashed down towards the side of the distant hall in a split second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A clear and melodious sword howl resounded out as an extremely dazzling thick sword light charged into the skies, and then it poured down from high above in the sky like a river of stars. Within this sword move, there were thunderstorms rumbling, water and fire roiling, Yin and Yang flowing, and the magnificent and grand scene seemed as if various Grand Dao profundities were fused within it, causing others to feel reverence and horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit!” Zhai Di who was in midair swiftly moved back and felt horrified in his heart, he felt that the might of this sword couldn’t be met head on and was impossible to go against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the movements of the other people that intended to charge couldn’t help but become momentarily sluggish when they saw the might of this strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thick sword light slashed down and directly drowned both of Zhai Di’s flying swords. Moreover, they could clearly see the phenomenon of the stellar bodies falling within the sword qi, and the Dao Insights contained within it were shocking. It slashed apart the ground before the ancient hall and caused an enormous black chasm to appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground quaked as countless cracks appeared like spiderwebs. Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou had seized this opportunity, causing their figures to have already flashed explosively into the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the ancient hall was swallowed by a violent spatial fluctuation, and it vanished along with Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou before the eyes of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This series of movements were like a flash of lightning. From Zhao Di withdrawing his flying swords, to Chen Xi’s sword strike descending from high above in the sky and slashing out a black chasm before the hall, and finally to the figures of Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou vanishing along with the hall, all of this had merely happened in an instant. However, everything that happened in this instant was so breathtaking, and it caused everyone to become dazed for a tiny bit of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a terrifying sword strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the first time that most of the people present had seen Chen Xi execute his cultivation in the Sword Dao, and it was precisely because it was the first time they saw it that they were even more deeply aware of how terrifying this sword strike was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, they’d once seen Chen Xi defeat Di Wanlou, Li Jun, and the others outside the mountain door of the ruins with a few punches, and they thought that was Chen Xi’s strongest trump card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet earlier, when they saw Chen Xi withdraw the Flaming Peacock Fan, they thought this Quasi Immortal Artifact was Chen Xi’s greatest reliance. But never had they imagined that Chen Xi’s cultivation in the Sword Dao would actually be so terrifying as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly how many trump cards has this fellow not revealed yet?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one was able to guess this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, everyone recovered from their momentary daze and looked towards the hall that had vanished, causing the expressions of everyone to become extremely gloomy and unsightly. Earlier, they’d actually allowed their prey to escape from right beneath their noses, and this was simply an enormous humiliation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the sake of seizing the talisman seals to enter the secret realm, they’d mobilized all their forces and contended both openly and secretly with each other. Originally, the treasure was within easy reach, and the secret realm was well within reach. Yet now, everything was gone, and their painstaking efforts had come to nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling caused everyone to almost go mad, and they wished for nothing more than to swallow Chen Xi up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, their gazes were already staring fixedly at Chen Xi who was the cause of all this, and they didn’t conceal their rage and killing intent in the slightest. If gazes could kill, then Chen Xi would have probably died a thousand times over by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Pei Yu’s gaze was gloomy, his expression livid, and his killing intent was surging like tidewater. A secret realm that was within easy reach had vanished just like this, and it caused him to hate Chen Xi to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Cui Xiuhong and the others who were behind Pei Yu, Qin Xiao’s group, and Bi Lingyun’s group couldn’t restrain their rage and killing intent as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Within the distant crowd, all the experts of the Skywolf Dynasty, Snowray Dynasty, Eastern Summer Dynasty, Darqian Dynasty, and Darxuan Dynasty roared at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, battle cries shook the heavens and the earth as killing intent bubbled and various lights fluttered about in the sky. Large expanses of martial techniques flowed down as piles of magic treasures blasted over, and everyone had made a move, causing attacks that covered the heavens and the earth to strike towards a single direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth seemed as if it had exploded open as magic treasures, martial techniques, and Divine Abilities poured down like a storm, like spraying lava, and all of it blasted towards Chen Xi in a dense and vast array that couldn’t be resisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes squinted. Even he didn’t dare go head on against such a formidable force. After all, it was the joint strength of countless experts gathered together to form a killing light that converged right at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was really struck by it, then not to mention his current cultivation, even if his combat strength was a level higher, it would be impossible for him to endure this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t hesitate in the slightest to change his position, and his figure moved as a myriad of stars condensed together and circulated into a pair of divine wings. With a flap of the wings, he soared past the attacks and avoided them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

They were like numerous divine arrows that densely filled the heavens and the earth as they shot violently towards the group of people that were closest to him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A scene like this was shocking and too terrifying. The Sword Dao cultivation that Chen Xi had cultivated diligently for a few tens of years had erupted with its might, and merely a single strike had taken the lives of six genius experts.</span></p>

No matter how strong Chen Xi is, it’s probably impossible for him to escape death under the encirclement of so many people.”</span></p>

There was no enmity between them and Chen Xi, and they’d come here this time merely for the sake of watching the show and didn’t hold any hope towards entering the secret realm. After all, the groups of Pei Yu, Qin Xiao, and Bi Lingyun were too strong, and there was practically no Dynasty amongst those that were present who were capable of going against them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its wide mouth was filled with fangs while a single horn grew on its head, and its figure was like a tiger or panther, yet it possessed the tail of a crocodile and a pair of wings. This was a Moon Devouring Silver Wyrmpanther which was also called a Silver Wyrmpanther. It was a descendant of an ancient ferocious beast and possessed a pure bloodline, causing it to be extremely formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Silver Wyrmpanther! It has actually developed the scales of a Wyrm, so its bloodline is really shocking! This beast’s strength is absolutely terrifying, and even though it’s slightly inferior to the peerless flying beast, Inferno Crane, it isn’t much inferior.” Many people were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aowu~” The appearance of this Silver Wyrmpanther that had a body that was enormous like a hill and emitted a shocking imposing aura pushed the other genius experts that besieged Chen Xi to the side while its limbs stomped on the air as it pounced towards Chen Xi. When looked at from afar, it was simply like an enormous hill flying over from midair, and it enveloped Chen Xi beneath its shadow.</span></p>

Being tied up in the slightest might cause him to suffer a calamity of annihilation, so he withdrew the Flaming Peacock Fan right away, causing a crimson ray of light to radiate brilliantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

If Chen Xi fell deep into a hopeless situation and fought desperately, then the consequences were something that they were unwilling to see.</span></p>

The scales that covered its body emanated divine lights, and it actually charged out from the envelopment of the sea of lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, its entire body was covered in crimson flames, and it was burned to the point it looked extremely hideous. But its ferocity didn’t reduce in the slightest as it opened up its bloody mouth and spat out surging silver lights that exploded like numerous stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw this ferocious beast had surmounted the boundaries of the Flaming Peacock Fan’s attack and intended to fight him in close combat, Chen Xi wasn’t fearful in the slightest, and he let out a long howl instead before charging forward while the Shaman Energy in his body surged. Thunderstorms rumbled as his fist struck out like a bolt of lightning that carried vortexes along with it, and it directly blasted onto the enormous paw of the Silver Wyrmpanther.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Moreover, the scales on its enormous paw were shattered as a hole that flowed with blood had been blasted open on it.</span></p>
