 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to assume the role of the Chieftain and deeply receive the support of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he’d exclaimed with shock at this moment, and it was obvious how great the shock in his heart was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this way, it caused Mo Ya to be even more curious towards the content of the jade slip, and she couldn’t help but size it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short moment, her eyes lit up abruptly as her red lips trembled, and she seemed to want to exclaim with shock, yet had forcefully endured it before continuing to inspect the jade slip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After another short moment passed, her entire body trembled while her ample and alluring chest rose and fell rapidly, and it drew out a breathtaking curve that caused the eyeballs of the nearby guards to almost fall out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those youths were stunned by this scene as a wisp of burning heat arose in their hearts, and then their faces flushed red as they lowered their heads without daring to look at Mo Ya’s proud figure any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gradually, Mo Ya’s breathing became rapid as her eyes grew brighter and brighter, and her entire body couldn’t be restrained from trembling. She seemed to be holding a rare and precious treasure, causing her to be excited to the point she was on the verge of losing control of her feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beautiful jet black hair was tied into a flowing ponytail, and she possessed a gorgeous appearance and a slender and hot figure. At this moment, she was entirely unaware that her rapid and tender breathing coupled with her hot figure that was trembling slightly struck an enormous blow on these youths that were filled with vigor and vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei couldn’t continue watching, and he coughed dryly before he said, “Mo Ya, how is it?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blackie and the others heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts. The display their Aunty Mo Ya put on earlier caused them to feel extremely embarrassed, but they were stunned right after that.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What? It’s 10 times more formidable than the cultivation technique I cultivated in the past?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei sighed instead. “Unfortunately, these cultivation techniques are only suitable to be cultivated by children, and they’re extremely complete. If we cultivate it, it would only accomplish the opposite effect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya’s beautiful brows frowned and she felt extremely regretful in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guard that had kept silent all along couldn’t help but speak. “What’s so difficult about that? Wouldn’t it be fine if we go look for Brother Chen Xi and ask for a cultivation technique as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya’s eyes lit up, and then they dimmed down. “Would he…agree?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei shook his head and burst into laughter. “It looks to me that you’re embarrassed, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya glared her eyes wide open and glance fiercely at Meng Wei before she puckered her lips. “You speak so casually, yet aren’t you the same?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei was stunned, and then he suddenly saw that guard sneaking off, causing him to be unable to refrain from frowning. “What’re you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Err, I’m going to ask Brother Chen Xi to bestow a cultivation technique to me.” The guard spoke with a distressed expression. “If I continue delaying then it would probably be cleaned off by the others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei and Mo Ya were astounded. Only now did they notice that numerous people were actually surrounded around Chen Xi, and all of them were the guards of the tribe. Some were waiting anxiously while scratching their heads while some were beaming with smiles as they left, and he was extremely popular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s truly a fellow that’s impossible to see through. Exactly how many secrets do you think are concealed in his possession? Why do I feel that he seems to be capable of everything and nothing is too much for him…?” Mo Ya sighed lightly as she spoke with a faint voice. However, she didn’t get a reply after waiting for a long time, and when she turned to look, she instantly gnashed her teeth with anger. “Meng Wei, you spineless bastard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Meng Wei had suddenly approached Chen Xi’s side and had a smile on his face as he talked with Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! You actually left me behind…” Mo Ya stamped her feet fiercely as she muttered and walked over with a murderous look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She split the crowd apart and directly arrive by Meng Wei’s side. However, before she could even speak, the opposite Chen Xi had said with a warm smile, “Miss Mo Ya, don’t worry, I’ve already prepared a cultivation technique for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Chen Xi passed a jade slip over. Obviously, it was just as he’d said, and he’d already prepared a suitable technique for Mo Ya to cultivate since the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya was stunned, and she forcefully swallowed the words that were about to escape her mouth. When faced with Chen Xi’s warm and magnanimous gaze, she lowered her head and became slightly embarrassed instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the surroundings were stunned. Mo Ya had always been a fiery woman that was mature, calm, and capable. Who would have imagined that she would actually reveal such a delicate and embarrassed bearing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya seemed to have noticed that something was off as well, and she instantly raised her head before fiercely sweeping the surroundings with her gaze until she forced them to not dare meet her gaze. Only then did she act poised and dignified as she received the jade slip. “Thank you, I’ll return this favor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as she finished speaking, she’d already turned and left, and her ponytail swayed in a gorgeous arc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned and felt extremely amused in his heart because he’d clearly seen the tip of Mo Ya’s finger tremble lightly when she received the jade slip. Obviously, she wasn’t as composed as she seemed on the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She’s truly a woman that wants to keep a tough outward appearance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed as he shook his head, and he started to pass out cultivation techniques to the others.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew very clearly that if he wanted to avoid the pursuit and destruction from the Xeno-race experts while allowing everyone to leave this Ninth Hell and arrive at the outside world safely, just his strength was far from enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention he’d lost his qi refinement cultivation now, whereas his body refinement cultivation had only recovered to around Golden Core Realm. Once he encountered some formidable figures, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he could only utilize the various cultivation techniques in his possession to strengthen the entire tribe because once every single one of them became stronger, they would be slightly safer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished distributing the cultivation techniques, Chen Xi noticed the entire group seemed to be absent-minded. He knew their minds were immersed within the cultivation techniques they’d obtained, and he couldn’t help but feel slightly amused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sized up the surroundings before immediately ordering them to set up camp. Under these circumstances, it was obviously not suitable for them to continue moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, all of you set your minds at ease and cultivate. Leave the food and guarding of the campsite to me.” Chen Xi knew that wasting the time of those guards and children at this moment was simply like a type of torment to them. So he could only assume the position of mess cook and guard.</span></p>
