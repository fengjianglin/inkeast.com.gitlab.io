 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

For example, the sudden attack of the assassin Qing Xiao at the Bloodbasin Hardlands, the sudden arrival of Wang Chong, Liu Jun, and Rui Qing at Darkcliff City, the pursuit of the white haired boy, Cui Ruyin…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the scenes were lifelike and were fully revealed down to the slightest detail before the eyes of everyone.</span></p>

This feeling came without reason, and it flashed momentarily before vanishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The gazes all of them shot Cui Fangjun had changed, and their expressions of rage carried indescribable disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even all the others that had spoken in favor of Cui Fangjun had become silent at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second Brother, what else do you have to say?!” Cui Fanghu took a deep breath and questioned with a grim voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How absurd!” Cui Fangjun’s expression was livid, and he frowned as he said, “I’m extremely furious towards all of this as well. But if you say that all of this was instructed by me, then you’re making slanderous charges against me! Perhaps someone is intentionally framing me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It has already come to this, yet you still intend to make excuses!?” Cu Fanghu burned with rage. His hair fluttered while he gnashed his teeth with hatred. As the saying goes, even a vicious tiger wouldn’t eat its cubs. Cui Fangjun’s despicable actions had touched the limits he could accept and infuriated him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third Uncle, calm your anger.” At this moment, Cui Qingning seemed to be especially composed, and her expression was extremely calm. She seemed to be completely emotionless as she stared at Cui Fangjun and said, “Second Uncle, you’re right. I do indeed have no proof that proves all of this was instructed by you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cui Fangjun grunted coldly and said, “That’s exactly how it is!”</span></p>

In the next moment, she said word by word, “But I possess proof that proves my Cui Clan’s Saint Artifact, the Netherworld Disk, wasn’t stolen by someone, and it was instead privately given away by you, Cui Fangjun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, everyone present was horrified and extremely astounded.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Cui Fangjun’s expression had become unsightly and gloomy to the extreme. He took a deep breath and worked hard to suppress the enormous waves in his heart as he said, “Qingning, there’s a limit to making slanderous charges! If you continue causing trouble for no reason, then don’t blame Second Uncle for being merciless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person had a vicious appearance. His features were flat, and his entire body was covered in strange eyes. He was precisely the Thousandeye Ghost Ape, Hou Zhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cui Fangjun couldn’t control himself any longer when he saw Hou Zhan, and his face turned grim as he cried out involuntarily. “How could this be possible?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked, and they were slightly puzzled because the Thousandeye Ghost Ape Clan had been annihilated in the annals of history. Who could have imagined that this fellow before their eyes would be a member of the Thousandeye Ghost Ape Clan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the changes in Cui Fangjun’s expression allowed everyone to suddenly realize that this person was probably the ‘proof’ that Cui Qingning spoke of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like Second Uncle has recognized him as well,” said Cui Qingning in a calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense!” Cui Fangjun shook his head immediately. “How could I possibly recognize him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Cui, I’m hoping on you to preserve my life! Could it be that you’re unwilling to admit what you’ve done?” Hou Zhan suddenly shouted with a sharp voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sure everyone has noticed that this person is a member of the Thousandeye Ghost Ape Clan, and his illusionary techniques are peerless beneath the heavens. It was precisely by relying on him that the Netherworld Disk was sent out of the clan.” Cui Qingning lowered her head to look at Hou Zhan before she said, “What appearance did you take all those years ago in the Cui Clan? Transform into it so that everyone may recognize you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hou Zhan hesitated for a moment, and then he looked at Cui Fangjun instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation developing to this extent had already caused Cui Fangjun’s mind to be thrown into chaos, and he was agitated and furious to the extreme. At this moment, when he saw Hou Zhan actually looked at him and faintly revealed the intent to seek help from him, he couldn’t help but berate immediately. “Bastard, what’re you looking at me for? You’re courting death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he suddenly raised his hand and directly moved to annihilate Hou Zhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, this strike was obstructed by Chen Xi who was prepared since the beginning, and then he exerted force with his fingers, causing Cui Fangjun’s figure to be shaken to the point he couldn’t help but retreat repeatedly by a few steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Bastard! You’re courting death!” Cui Fangjun was furious and was just about to make a move when something flashed before his eyes, and then a figure was already blocking his path. It was exactly Cui Fanghu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second Brother, it wouldn’t be late for you to make a move after he finishes!” Cui Fanghu spoke coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cui Fangjun’s expression changed indeterminately, and he stared fixedly at Cui Fanghu for a long time before finally forcefully restraining himself because he was clearly aware that perhaps his ability in tactics far exceeded Chen Xi, yet his combat strength was inferior. Once he made a move, he would have no way to back out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could you!? Cui Fangjun! You actually intend to silence me when the matter is exposed! Even if I fucking die, I’ll drag you down with me!” Hou Zhan exploded with rage when he saw this scene, and his figure flashed before he transformed into another person. This person’s appearance was ordinary, and he possessed a robust figure and a loyal appearance.</span></p>

Do all of you still recognize this face?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his voice had become coarse, and it was like he was a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re…Wei Hu!?” Someone exclaimed with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right! I remember now! He’s exactly that slave that followed by Second Elder’s side!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wei Hu! It really is him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone recalled that this person frequently followed by the side of the Second Elder, Cui Fangjun, and he was like the Second Elder’s shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly, it’s me! One year ago, it was precisely this old geezer, Cui Fangjun, that stole the Saint Artifact of your clan, the Netherworld Disk, and then he asked me to change my appearance and secretly send it away!” Hou Zhan stared at Cui Fangjun with resentment, and he gnashed his teeth and said, “Unfortunately, I was loyal and faithful, yet I received such an outcome in return. I was truly fucking blind!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was completely sure that this matter was absolutely related to Cui Fangjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the gazes they shot at Cui Fangjun carried extreme fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s stolen the Saint Artifact of the clan and given it to another, and then he attacked the daughter of the past Patriarch repeatedly. This was simply despicable and shameless to the limit, and his crimes deserved death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second Uncle, do you have anything else to say now?” Cui Qingning spoke coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cui Fangjun was silent while he revealed a livid and pale expression. After a long time, he suddenly raised his head while his eyes were already filled with the color of madness. “Haha! Who cares about proof!? Isn’t it just for the sake of the position of Patriarch? The loser is always in the wrong, so I, Cui Fangjun, will absolutely not admit defeat just like this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his figure flashed, and he actually intended to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed, and he was just about to make a move and stop Cui Fangjun. However, right at this moment, an unexpected event arose abruptly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An enormous hand that was crystalline like jade suddenly tore through the sky and grabbed lightly, and it seemed as if it was catching a fish from a river. It actually easily captured Cui Fangjun’s figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, Cui Fangjun was pressed down to a kneel on the ground, and no matter how he struggled and roared furiously, he was unable to stand up again. It seemed as if a myriad of mountains were pressing down onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How formidable!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked in his heart. Cui Fangjun was a peak sovereign at the Earthly Immortal Realm at any rate, yet he was actually easily suppressed like an ant, and he didn’t even have room to resist. So exactly how high was the cultivation of the person that did this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

As soon as it appeared, it emanated divine radiance that shot out 30km into the distance, and auspicious qi surged while it revealed a gorgeous and vast scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, numerous mighty figures strode out from within the golden door, and they were like numerous brilliant suns that had made an appearance as they illuminated the entire sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person in the lead was a grey haired old man with a tall figure and an icy cold bearing. His entire body emanated strands of golden rain, and they wove together to form the energy of the laws that suffused the heavens and the earth, causing him to seem divine and mighty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed like a saint of legend that had descended into the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings, Ancestor!” When they saw the figure of this old man in the lead, all the clansmen of the Cui Clan that were present here swiftly knelt down on the ground, and their faces were covered in reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, this old man was the ancestor of the Cui Clan — Cui Zhenkong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A supreme existence that was comparable to the Nether Spring Grand Emperor, the Hall Master of Granny Meng Hall, and the Grand Ministers of the Six Paths of Hell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for those mighty figures behind Cui Zhenkong, they were probably the seniors of the Cui Clan that lived in seclusion. This was the true might of the Cui Clan, and it was terrifying, shocking, and awed the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst everyone present here, only Chen Xi and Bei Ling didn’t kneel down, and they seemed to be extremely conspicuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Today is the day my Cui Clan worships its ancestors. Guests, please head to the pavilion for distinguished guests and rest for now.” Cui Zhenkong’s gaze was like a golden sharp blade that could tear open the heavens and the earth, and it swept down to descend onto Chen Xi and Bei Ling, causing both of them to feel a wave of horror in their hearts and sense a terrifying pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fanghu, you lead them away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understood!” Cui Fanghu rose and arrived by Chen Xi and Bei Ling’s side before he said via voice transmission, “Just leave for now. With the Ancestor present here, no mishaps will befall Qingning anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi and Bei Ling glanced at Cui Qingning and left with Cui Fanghu when they saw her nod back at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about me!?” Hou Zhan stood up with a swish, and he intended to leave along with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

He lightly pressed down with a single finger, and a strand of the energy of the laws wove together before it tore through space towards Hou Zhan. It annihilated Hou Zhan on the spot, and it was as easy as crushing an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked once more in his heart when he noticed this scene, and he had a completely new understanding towards the resources and reserves of the Cui Clan.</span></p>
