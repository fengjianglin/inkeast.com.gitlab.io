 <p>Chapter 119 – The Dignity of A Nobody</p>
 <p>The Immortal Assembling Pavilion was called the number one place of indulgence in Dragon Lake City. People who indulge themselves here either possessed formidable strengths or deep backgrounds, and they were naturally all first-class figures.</p>
 <p>Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei appearing here was obviously because that woman Qingni had brought them here to have fun.</p>
 <p>Who was Qingni?</p>
 <p>Chen Xi didn’t know, but he’d noticed when they were outside the city gate that this woman’s cultivation was unfathomable, and it was at least at the Violet Palace Realm or above. Moreover, he’d known from the proud and restrained aura on her that her background was surely extraordinary.</p>
 <p>So Chen Xi wasn’t worried when he saw Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei in confrontation with the young man who had an imposing build. If his expectations were correct, then the woman called Qingni would surely appear to stop him soon.</p>
 <p>Not to mention, this place was the Immortal Assembling Pavilion. If a disagreement that affected the customers were to occur here, then the power behind the Immortal Assembling Pavilion would surely not agree to it.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Duanmu Ze stood up and walked over before curiously looking down the pavilion, and he couldn’t help but be stunned. “Xie Zhan? No wonder he dared to make noise in the Immortal Assembling Pavilion, so it turns out that it’s him.”</p>
 <p>“Is he very formidable?” Chen Xi asked in surprise. A person that was able to make this Young Master, Duanmu Ze, recognize him was obviously no ordinary figure.</p>
 <p>“This fellow is the second son of the Xie Clan’s Patriarch and was born with extreme physical strength. Even though he’s only 19 years old, he has already attained the 6th star of the Violet Palace Realm and is called the little genius of the Xie Clan.”</p>
 <p>Duanmu Ze said, “But this fellow’s temper is terribly bad, causing trouble all the time. He’s atrocious, overbearing, and extremely arrogant. If it wasn’t for him having the Xie Clan supporting him from behind, he would have probably been crippled by someone long ago.” Duanmu Ze shook his head as he spoke, seeming to hold Xie Zhan in extreme contempt.</p>
 <p>The Xie Clan was similarly one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City. As the Xie Clan Patriarch’s second son, Xie Zhan was arrogant and domineering, but so long as he didn’t offend any formidable figure, there was indeed no one who dared touch him.</p>
 <p>“Right, why is he called the little genius?” Chen Xi asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s naturally because of his elder brother, Xie Meng. In the Xie Clan, Xie Meng and Xie Zhan were called as the big and little genius. Especially Xie Meng, he’s extremely formidable and is an existence that was 23rd in rank on the last Hidden Dragon Rankings. After all, he was only 13 at that time, and he’d already cultivated to attain the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm. Presently, 10 years have passed, and his strength is surely even more formidable.” Duanmu Ze explained, and his eyes contained a strand of extremely deep fear.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi had to admit, this Xie Meng was indeed formidable for attaining the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm at the age of 13. According to this speed, ten years later, today, what extent would his cultivation have attained?</p>
 <p><i>Dragon Lake City is worthy of being called a place that’s a lair of dragons and tigers!</i></p>
 <p>Chen Xi was already unable to remember how many times he’d let out an emotional sigh about this. This caused him to understand even more deeply that however great one was, there was always someone greater. This world was too vast and would forever have no lack of monstrous geniuses.</p>
 <p>“Hmm? He’s going too far!” It was at this moment that Duanmu Ze was stunned, then his gaze abruptly focused towards outside the pavilion.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi turned around, and his expression instantly went gloomy when he heard the sounds of discussion.</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p>Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei were extremely uneasy, as everything here caused them to feel unaccustomed.</p>
 <p>The scene that was like an immortal realm, the luxurious and exquisite food, the men and women that were smartly dressed and possessed an oppressive air of nobility… This place wasn’t the commoner’s district that they were familiar with, and the people they met weren’t the impoverished people in the town they were familiar with.</p>
 <p>Everything in this place caused a strand of dense inferiority and helplessness to emerge from their hearts, like a terrified little fawn that ran into a pack of wolves; struck with panic, terrified, and uneasy.</p>
 <p>Boundless rage was contained on the face of the brother and sister, and as they looked at the tall young man with a cold smile, his gaze was like a cat playing with a mouse. They wished for nothing more than to turn around and leave this den of demons that caused them to feel uneasy, helpless, terrified, and enraged!</p>
 <p>“Little Brother, speak no more. I’ll apologize.” Mu Yao took a deep breath and stood before her brother as she forcefully restrained the rage in her heart. However, as soon as she finished saying this, her slender figure trembled unrestrainedly. This clearly showed how great the rage and humiliation this young girl that was only 15 or 16 was enduring.</p>
 <p>“It’s too late! Kneeling down and apologizing won’t do. I’ll only let you and your brother off if you agree to be my concubine. How about it?” Xie Zhan raised his chin as he spoke unhurriedly.</p>
 <p>“You…!” Mu Wenfei’s face was livid as he roared. “If it wasn’t for you trying to flirt with my Big Sister first, she wouldn’t have grazed your face. You entirely bully others!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yao was dumbstruck, as only until now did she understand that the big and tall young man before her didn’t intend on letting her off since the beginning.</p>
 <p>“HAHAHAHA!” When he saw the enraged and helpless appearance of the brother and sister, Xie Zhan wantonly roared with laughter at the sky. “I’m bullying others, so what about it? If it wasn’t for your appearance being not bad, this Young Master would have killed both of you long ago. Why else would I speak so much nonsense with the two of you?”</p>
 <p>Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei were enraged to the point their bodies trembled, and they were extremely alike to caged beasts that had fallen into despair and helplessness.</p>
 <p>The commotion over here had drawn the attention of the nearby people long ago. Numerous gazes that carried ridicule focused onto Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei, and they seemed to have an appearance of watching the show.</p>
 <p>The gazes of these people were extremely discerning. They were able to discern from the behavior and expression of the brother and sister that they had just entered Dragon Lake City and might have come from some remote village. Who would have nothing better to do than to stand up and offend Xie Zhan for poor and lowly people like them?</p>
 <p>“I’ll count to three. If you don’t agree, then I’ll use force?” Xie Zhan held up a wine cup before slowly sipping and savoring it with a calm and composed appearance. It was indeed as the other people thought, he’d discerned that this brother and sister didn’t seem like people who had any background, and that’s why he was being so unbridled.</p>
 <p>“Agree to Young Master Xie. He’s the little genius of the Xie Clan. You can enjoy wealth and position for your entire life once you follow him, and that’s much better than anything else.”</p>
 <p>“Exactly, how many people fight to their deaths, yet are unable to find a chance to have a meteoric rise like this? You have to cherish it.”</p>
 <p>The nearby spectators emitted a wave of loud laughter as they added fuel to the flame.</p>
 <p>Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei’s bodies trembled even more intensely when they heard the surrounding discussions and loud laughter, they tightly clenched their hands as they bit their lips without letting go, and their expressions were extremely livid.</p>
 <p>“Xie Zhan, aren’t you going too far for bullying my people like this!?” It was at this moment that a clear and pleasant voice abruptly sounded out, and it seemed unexpected amongst the mass of sounds of discussion.</p>
 <p>The gazes of everyone quickly shot towards a direction, they saw a peerlessly beautiful woman with hair that was pitch black like ink, willow leaf shaped brows, clear eyes, snow white skin, and a jade dress walking out slowly. There was a handsome white clothed young man following by her side.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Qingni!” When they saw these two people, the excitement in Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei’s heart could be easily imagined.</p>
 <p>When he saw these two people appear, Chen Xi, who was within the bamboo pavilion, couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. When he heard Xie Zhan humiliate Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei earlier, he was almost unable to refrain from making a move.</p>
 <p>“Yan Qingni! Little Brother?” Duanmu Ze had an astounded expression.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Chen Xi couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
 <p>“Yan Qingni is one of the 36 Elite Disciples of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, and the one beside her is Duanmu’s younger brother, Duanmu Lin.” Unnoticed to him, Du Qingxi had walked to arrive before the window and she spoke in a light voice.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi came to a sudden understanding and completely eased up. With the appearance of these two people, Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei would naturally be safe and sound.</p>
 <p>However, the development of the matter wasn’t as Chen Xi expected.</p>
 <p>Xie Zhan was only slightly stunned when he saw Yan Qingni and Duanmu Lin appear, then he sneered. “Your people? Your people can be so presumptuous?</p>
 <p>“Then what do you want?” Yan Qingni’s beautiful brows frowned. Actually, she was unwilling to go against an arrogant and domineering son from a powerful clan like Xie Zhan, as offending the Xie Clan behind him for the sake of Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei wasn’t worth it.</p>
 <p>Seeming to have discerned Yan Qingni’s thoughts, Duanmu Lin said with a smile, “Brother Xie, how about this? I’ll ask Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei to apologize to you, and we’ll end this matter at that?”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Duanmu Lin turned around and instructed Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei. “What’re you two still staring blankly for, quickly apologize to Young Master Xie!”</p>
 <p>Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei were both dumbstruck. They originally thought that their savior had come, but unexpectedly, they still had to apologize in the end, and this caused the two of them to be slightly taken by surprise.</p>
 <p>“It’s he who tried to flirt with my Big Sister first, and it’s he who is in the wrong. How can you ask us to apologize to him?” Mu Wenfei summoned up the courage to speak.</p>
 <p>“Idiot!” Duanmu Lin glared fiercely at Mu Wenfei, and he wished for nothing more than to slap this rash youth to death.</p>
 <p>“I’ll apologize, don’t scold my little brother.” Mu Yao loved her little brother the most. When she saw Duanmu Lin snap at her little brother, she couldn’t help but speak out to protect him.</p>
 <p>“Alright, because of giving face to the two of you, ask her to kneel down and kowtow a hundred times, and I’ll let the two of them off.” Xie Zhan smiled gloomily.</p>
 <p>Mu Yao was stunned, her little face went completely red from anger, yet when she looked at the nearby Yan Qingni, she instead noticed that Yan Qingni remained completely indifferent, causing her heart to instantly touch rock bottom, and her entire body started to tremble intensely once again.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!” Duanmu Lin grunted in dissatisfaction. He was truly unable to understand why this pair of brother and sister that had nothing to depend on would be so keen on not losing face. <i>Was living more important or was dignity more important?</i></p>
 <p>“I’ll…apologize.” Mu Yao smiled sadly as if she’d lost her soul.</p>
 <p>“Sister, don’t make yourself suffer. You’ve sacrificed too much for the sake of allowing me to enter the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. If someone has to kneel, then it should be me!” Mu Wenfei grabbed onto his sister and gritted his teeth as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Quickly, quickly, this Young Master’s time is extremely precious.” Xie Zhan wildly roared with laughter.</p>
 <p>Mu Wenfei’s little face was livid, he bit his lips as he closed his eyes and slowly knelt down. It was at this moment that a sigh sounded out in his ears. “One mustn’t be arrogant, yet can’t be without pride. Once you kneel the first time, there will be the second, the third… Do you hope to become a person like this?”</p>
 <p>Mu Wenfei’s heart shook as if he was struck by lightning, and he abruptly stood up before saying hysterically. “I’m not willing! I, Mu Wenfei, won’t lower my head to any enemy!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, everyone present was stunned, seeming to have completely never expected that at this last moment, this 12 or 14 year old youth would back out.</p>
 <p>“Good! You’ve got balls! The two of you can see, I’ve already given you face, but they didn’t appreciate it.” Xie Zhan laughed gloomily.</p>
 <p>Yan Qingni and Duanmu Lin’s expressions instantly went gloomy.</p>
 <p>“Go, capture that little beauty for me. As for that little fellow, cripple his Dantian. Didn’t you have pride? Then let me see how long you can keep it up!” Xie Zhan casually instructed.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Young Master.” The two robust servants walked out, and they laughed savagely as they walked towards Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be afraid, leave it to me.” Right at this moment, an indifferent and calm voice abruptly resounded out, and the voice hadn’t died down when everyone saw something flash before their eyes and a tall figure had appeared before Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei like a ghost.</p>
 <p><i>What swift speed!</i></p>
 <p>Everyone was shocked in their hearts, and they all shot their gazes at the person that had arrived.</p>
