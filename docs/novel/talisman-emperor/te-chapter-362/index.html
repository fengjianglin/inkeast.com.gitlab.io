 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivators from countless sects and clans of the northern barbaric lands, southern territory, eastern sea, and central plains; and various independent cultivators hurried towards Silken City in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some small clans and powers were fated to have no chance to participate in this grand event. After all, Silken City was situated at the center of the central plains. Not to mention that it was far away, the path towards it was filled with a variety of dangers, and those with weak strength would probably be buried amidst the various dangers before arriving at Silken City. For example, by assaults of beasts, plundering of bandits, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So all the cultivators who had the strengths to head to Silken City and participate in the Allstar Meeting were from a great power that dominated an area. Moreover, their group surely had an expert leading them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the independent cultivators that were like wild cranes and floating clouds, if they wanted to witness the Allstar Meeting, then their strength probably had to be at the Golden Core Realm or above, and perhaps only then would they be able to safely arrive at Silken City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, for the sake of not missing this grand event, many powers had departed a month before. After all, the Allstar Meeting this time was publicly acknowledged as being unprecedentedly grand and rare to see in a thousand years, and it would have countless geniuses participating in it. If they were to miss this grand event, then they would probably regret it for their entire lifetimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the entire Darchu Dynasty was completely seething with excitement, Chen Xi, Ya Qing, Yan Yan, Yun Na, and the Thunder Marquis Estate’s Junior Marquis, Wang Zhenfeng, had left Thunder City and headed towards Silken City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason the Allstar Meeting drew the gaze of the entire cultivation world was firstly because this grand event was held by the Imperial Family. If they were able to obtain a rank in the Allstar Meeting, then would be bound to cut a striking figure, become renowned in the world, and win supreme honor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Secondly, it was because so long as one obtained the top 10 rankings in the Allstar Meeting, one would be able to enter the Primeval Battlefield and arrive at the sacred place of legend, the place that was closest to the Immortal Dimension — The Dark Reverie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it could be said that besides competing for rankings, they were also competing for the qualifications to enter the Primeval Battlefield and arrive at the Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whitecrane Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A group of peaks that rose higher and higher formed a cross shape. On a spacious peak that was suffused with smoke and mist, groups of red clawed white cranes fluttered about as their clear cries shot into the nine heavens, and it seemed like a paradise on earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

Suddenly, a myriad of hazy divine lights appeared in the sky above the spacious peak, and it seemed like auspicious qi that had descended from the heavens to form numerous peculiar scenes that seemed like lotus flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene here instantly alarmed the entire Whitecrane Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s Bewitching Dew Peak. Could it be that Eldest Senior Sister has emerged from closed door cultivation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest Senior Sister has always been in closed door cultivation since returning from the Oceanic Desert. At this moment, as soon as she emerged, the wind and clouds surged as a phenomenon of the heavens and the earth appeared suddenly. Her strength has probably increased greatly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah. There’s only a month from the Allstar Meeting now. With Eldest Senior Sister’s impressive cultivation as a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal, it would be sufficient for her to annihilate all opposition and seize first place!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous streaks tore through the sky from the various peaks in the Whitecrane Sect as they looked towards Bewitching Dew Peak from afar, and their gazes carried a fervent and astonished expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day and after being in closed door cultivation for three years, the Eldest Disciple of the Whitecrane Sect, the favored genius of the heavens, Qing Xiuyi, who was a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal, had caused auspicious light to descend from the skies and the sound of the Dao to be chanted as she emerged once more into the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merak Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Merak Pavilion was a sect that practically lived in seclusion and the disciples of the sect very rarely made an appearance in the world, causing them to be mysterious and possess a low profile. But no one in the entire cultivation world dared look down upon the strength of the Merak Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. The current Emperor Chu, the Kings of the four great king estates, and some experts of the Imperial Family that had shut themselves from the outside world had more or less once cultivated in the Merak Pavilion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How shocking the force possessed by the Merak Pavilion was obvious just from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, if it didn’t have some hidden resources and reserves, then it would be utterly incapable of drawing so many members of the Imperial Family to cultivate there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a secret chamber within the Merak Pavilion, it was extremely hot as waves of heat surged, and the terrifying high temperature seemed as if it was capable of melting anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bubble! Bubble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a large bronze cauldron with raging flames beneath it within the secret chamber. The body of the cauldron had birds, beasts, insects, and fish inscribed on it; besides that, there were also the diagrams of people from ancient times offering sacrifice to the heavens, and it emitted an ancient and desolate aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Water that revealed a blood red color boiled within the cauldron, and it was extremely thick. The strange thing was that this blood colored water didn’t have the slightest smell of blood, and it instead effused strands of fragrance as it gurgled and bubbled. At this moment, there was a young man sitting cross-legged within the cauldron with his eyes closed. He seemed to be unable to feel the scorching heat in the cauldron, and his cold face had a carefree expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, an enormous phantom of a Fiendgod appeared within the secret chamber, and this Ancient Fiendgod phantom practically occupied the entire secret chamber. At the instant it appeared, it roared furiously to the sky with a voice that was like a thunderclap while it struggled intensely, and it seemed to desire to struggle free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re merely a strand of Blood Essence and soul! Submit to me, now!” Right at this moment, the young man suddenly opened his eyes as he abruptly let out a thunderclap as he shouted out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, this Ancient Fiendgod phantom suffered a heavy injury and unwillingly transformed into strands of divine light that gushed into the body of the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man’s robust and well-proportioned body emitted a wave of rumbling that was like the melody of the Dao. Blood qi was like a cloud above him as he emitted a vast and mighty aura that was exceedingly ancient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a formidable strength! With my current strength, ranking in the top 3 of the Allstar Meeting is simply like retrieving it from my pocket!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man clenched his fists tightly and couldn’t help but raise his head and let out a long howl that was clear, resonant, melodious, and shot up into the nine heavens when he felt the surging and abundant energy in his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha! Qinghe, quickly depart to Silken City and display your unparalleled brilliance!” Outside the chamber, the clear and hearty laughter of the slovenly Old Daoist resounded out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, the Merak Pavilion’s disciple, Zhao Qinghe, had fused and gained control of the Blood Essence of an Ancient Fiendgod before emerging from closed door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wise King’s Estate.</span></p>

When looked at from afar, his entire body seemed like a dazzling sun that caused others to not dare look directly at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Allstar Meeting this time is extremely significant. Changtian, are you confident in ranking in the top 10?” A void that rumbled like surging thunder resounded out within the vast hall.</span></p>

Even though his voice was calm and indifferent, it revealed extremely strong confidence, and he possessed a terrifying and dignified imposing manner.</span></p>

Let’s not talk about you for the time being, what about you, Chongming? After cultivating in the Demonflame Sea for three years, do you have to confidence to look down upon everyone in the Allstar Meeting?”</span></p>

If my Wise King’s Estate is able to occupy two of the top 10 positions in the Allstar Meeting this time, then I’ll agree to any request by the two of you!” The Wise King stood up from his throne and had his hands behind his back as he looked down towards the lower part of the hall, and his voice was sonorous like a bell and a heroic expression covered his stern and dignified face.</span></p>

Beneath the eaves of the golden hut hung a string of scarlet red chili peppers, and they added a worldly aura to the place.</span></p>

If there was anything special about them, then perhaps the fruits and vegetables here were obviously fresher and finer.</span></p>

She straightened up her body from the vegetable garden when night descended, and then she carried the vegetable basket and walked joyfully into the hut.</span></p>

With a gesture of her hand, an azure and glossy wine gourd appeared on the table.</span></p>

This is probably the last time you’ll be able to eat the food I made, hurry up and come out!” After she finished doing all this, the young woman raised her hand to knock the old pine tree before her as she grinned.</span></p>

When I think about how my obedient and good disciple is about to leave, my heart hurts so much. I’m not eating, I’m not eating.” A sigh resounded out from the old pine tree and spoke slowly.</span></p>

It hurts because no one will be there to cook for you, right? If you don’t want to, then forget it! In any case, I’m going to participate in the Allstar Meeting, so I’ll be leaving once I finish eating.” As she spoke, the young woman sat before the table and picked up a pair of chopsticks before chewing carefully and swallowing slowly.</span></p>

Up until the point she finished eating, the old pine tree didn’t emit the slightest sound, causing the surrounding atmosphere to be extremely quiet.</span></p>

Take care of yourself. I’ll come back to see you after I get tired of everything in the Dark Reverie.” After she finished eating, the young woman stood up and stood quietly before the old pine tree for a long time before speaking word by word with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one replied.</span></p>

If I were to meet with you, then I’m afraid you would really not be willing to leave… With your natural talent, it wouldn’t be difficult for you to become an Immortal after entering the Dark Reverie.” Amidst the unhurried voice, a chubby little old man walked out from within the old pine tree. He had white hair and a rosy complexion, and he had a white beard that was like a waterfall beneath his jaw that fluttered without end. He raised his eyes to look towards the direction Zhen Liuqing left with a gaze that contained lightning flashes, rumbling thunder, and the movement between sun and moon, and his eyes only recovered its calm after a long time.<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
