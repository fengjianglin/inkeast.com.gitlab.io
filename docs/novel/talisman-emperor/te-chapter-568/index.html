It’s easy for one that’s outstanding to suffer the envy of others. Presently, the three dimensions are about to undergo an upheaval, and a storm is approaching. Such a good seedling can’t suffer any harm.” The Sect Master pondered slightly before he understood the old man’s intentions, and he gave the order right away. “From today onwards, everyone is prohibited from speaking of this matter, and violators…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will be thrown into the Floating Island!” As he finished speaking, Wen Huating’s face that was warm like jade was already filled with killing intent, and it caused all the nearby elders to be shocked in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They knew clearly that the Floating Island was a restricted area of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, and the traitors of the sect and great sinners were locked in there. Once one was thrown in there, it would be impossible to escape forever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master, this kid’s natural talent is extraordinary, but if he’s protected just like this and doesn’t experience tempering, then he wouldn’t be any different than a sheltered flower, and it would probably be easy for him to come to a premature end.” Elder Yue Chi spoke out abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating frowned. He knew that Yue Chi and Madman Liu didn’t get along, so when he heard these words, he couldn’t help but be worried in his heart that Yue Chi would implicate Chen Xi in this conflict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating knew extremely well that even though he was respected as the Sect Master, yet he didn’t possess the supreme authority to decide everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Nine Radiance Sword Sect was truly too enormous, causing there to be numerous elders, and there were even many seniors of extremely high seniority that lived in seclusion. All of this restricted his authority greatly, and he had no choice but the carefully consider the opinion and intentions of every single elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simply speaking, the Nine Radiance Sword Sect was like a Dynasty of the mortal world. There were marquis, kinsmen of the Emperor, and both internal and external officials. The entire power was extremely complicated and complex, so even if he was respected as the Emperor, there were some places where he was unable to manage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let him walk down his path by himself, all of you only have to pay close attention to him, and it would be sufficient if all of you don’t interfere.” The old man on the rocking chair opened his eyes and swept everyone with his gaze, and there was a faint trace of warning within. “As for the matters between the younger generation, allow the younger generation to resolve it themselves. After all, in this Dark Reverie, every expert can only rely on himself at all times as he rises!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

Twittering birds, fragrant flowers, and hanging plants were visible all over the heavens and the earth while Immortal Energy drifted all over, and it seemed like an immortal paradise in the realm of men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi saw this scene before him once he charged into the beam of light at the center of the lotus platform, and he couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place… seemed to be just like the world of stars in the Manor, and it forms a world of its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, compared to the world of stars, the space here isn’t very big, and it’s like a gorge that’s split apart by a river</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t ponder for took long before moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his inference, he ought to have passed through the test of the lotus platform, and since he’d already arrived here successfully now, he ought to not encounter any danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gorge was covered in lush verdant grass while a small stream that was clear like jade gurgled as it flowed through the center. There was a pergola at the edge of the stream, and within the pergola was a stone table that had a pile of books scattered on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These books were cut out from bamboo and bound together. When piled up together, they emitted an ancient fragrance of books that seemed to go back to the primeval times and the primordial era when sages used blades as their brushes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi arrived here, his attention was drawn by the numerous bamboo slips on the stone table at first glance. If it was said that Dao Art inheritance existed within the gorge, then it would surely be stored within these bamboo slips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d once heard that during the primeval times, men used the skin of beasts, bamboo, stones, and furnaces as their material to inscribe words upon and pass on the Dao, and it was an entirely different when compared to the jade slips that were commonly used now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this the place of inheritance that’s the most mysterious in the Nine Radiance Dao Scripture?” Chen Xi took a deep breath and restrained the excitement in his heart before stepping forward and walking towards the pergola by the bank of the stream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, look! How many years has it been? Someone has finally come today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect are really getting worse and worse generation after generation. They made us wait bitterly for a few thousand years before someone has finally appeared. Truly disappointing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, actually, it can already be considered to be not bad that someone was capable of entering here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when Chen Xi had just started moving, a wave of whispered discussions suddenly resounded out. At this moment, it instantly shocked him to the point of breaking out in cold sweat because his Divine Sense had stretched out 5,000km in the surroundings, but he didn’t notice any living being with signs of life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, let me test your strength first, little fellow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, loud laughter resounded out, and then an extremely sharp sword qi that carried the might of the heavens and the earth flashed over from the sky, and it slashed through the sky as it struck towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword qi was extremely swift like a bolt of lightning, and a vast and surging river of sword qi actually appeared in the sky as it slashed out. It seemed like a silver river that lay across the heavens and the earth, and it possessed a tremendous imposing aura and seemed rather magnificent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most horrifying of it all was that this sword qi seemed to have transformed the heavens and the earth to be of use to it, and it was filled with an unshakable might of the heavens and the earth. The sword qi flashed out both horizontally and vertically, and it simply seemed capable of slashing apart the stellar bodies and shattering both Yin and Yang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Chen Xi’s reaction speed, he was still caught off guard and retreated repeatedly while the protective barrier on his body was slices into pieces, and the sword qi almost broke through his defenses and heavily injured his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was exceedingly terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Chen Xi was almost injured by this sword qi even with his current strength and the speed of his Starsky Wings that could compare to the speed of teleportation, and if it was any other Rebirth Realm cultivator, the cultivator would probably have been killed instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was actually executed by a bamboo slip…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he dodged repeatedly, Chen Xi noticed that the thing that executed this sword qi was actually one of the bamboo slips within the pergola!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, this bamboo slip was floating in midair while covered in multicolored flowing lights, and it emitted a peerlessly fierce and vast sword qi that was simply shocking like that of a peerless expert of the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the voice from before wouldn’t be…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi suddenly realized that there seemed to be a sound of laughter that spoke about wanting to test his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad, not bad. You were actually able to dodge 10% of my sword qi attacks, you can inherit my mantle. Haha!” In the next moment, Chen Xi heard that voice resound out once more. Moreover, it had surprisingly come from that bamboo slip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on? Could it be that all these bamboo slips have become demons?” Chen Xi was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything in the heavens and the earth had a spirit. If some ordinary grass and rocks obtained a fortuitous encounter, they would turn into demons. Moreover, there were numerous legends about demons in the mortal world. For example, the Pagoda Tree Demon that would transform into a beauty at night and sneak into the temple to tempt young men before absorbing their Yang energy to nourish itself.</span></p>
