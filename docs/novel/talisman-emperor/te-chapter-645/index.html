 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surging flames suffused an extremely far expanse, and it formed a storm of flames that whistled about in the surroundings. The bone piercing coldness similarly covered the heavens and the earth, and it roared as it raged through the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was able to sense that no matter if it was the storm of flames or the torrent of ice, a light brush with them would be sufficient for any Nether Transformation Realm cultivator to be annihilated, causing them to be extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one was unable to find a safe path to enter the Dark Parasol’s Abyss from there, then it would absolutely be a path of no return. Even Earthly Immortal Realm experts would be crushed and suffer a calamity of death when facing the infinite suns and moons that circulated about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AH!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, only a small number of cultivators were capable of deducing a safe path, whereas existences like Long Zhenbei that possessed the Serpent Dragon’s Spiriteyes were extremely rare, so rashly entering would only cause one to face the fate of a horrible death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if they clearly knew this, there were still many cultivators that couldn’t restrain the greed in their hearts, and they yearned to enter the Dark Parasol’s Abyss to obtain a great fortune. So they resolutely took the risk and entered the sea of clouds with the intention of passing through by luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, reality proved that there was absolutely no luck to be found within the sea of clouds. In the end, these cultivators that came like moths that darted into the flames either died miserably or became utterly lost within the boundless sea of clouds, and it was impossible for them to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They truly overestimate their ability. Didn’t they assess their strengths? This is the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, so how could it be a place that an ordinary person can come into contact with?” Long Zhenbei led the way ahead, and he couldn’t help but shake his head endlessly when he heard these shrill cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though great fortune was hidden within the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, it was similarly a place of great danger. Since ancient times until now, there had been countless experts that had perished within it, and this was a fact that was icy cold, brutal, and impossible to deny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed. Coming here without sufficient preparations would only end in death.” An Wei nodded in agreement as well. The greater the chances of fortune, it normally meant that the risk was greater, and this was an irrefutable truth since ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister An, what plans do you have after we enter the Dark Parasol’s Abyss?” Chen Xi asked abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll naturally head to the Dark Parasol Secret Realm to search for Grand Dao Fragments. Most of the experts that came to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss this time have come for this.” An Wei combed her black hair behind her ears, and said with a melodious voice, “Amongst the Grand Dao profundities I’ve grasped, there are two that are only a step away from attaining the Perfection Realm. If I’m able to find the Grand Dao Fragments for these two types of Grand Dao, then I’ll be able to grasp six times my combat strength in a short period of time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six times her combat strength?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Zhenbei’s heart shook, and he was extremely surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d only grasped five times his combat strength now, and he’d similarly come to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss this time for the sake of finding Grand Dao Fragments to perfect his comprehension of Dao Insights and attain his goal of improving his combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So Senior Sister An has already mastered four times combat strength now, it’s truly admirable.” Chen Xi was stunned, and he seemed as if it was the first time he was acquainted with this beautiful young woman that possessed an ethereal bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was extremely surprised indeed because he’d advanced to become a Seed Disciple along with An Wei. But it was the first time he knew that An Wei had actually already grasped four times her combat strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman deserved to be the number one Elite Disciple at that time. Her natural endowments are shocking, her natural talent is extraordinary, and it’s rare that she conducts herself in a low profiled and restrained manner. It’s extremely easy for others to overlook her strength and only pay attention to how beautiful her outward appearance is.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then… what about after we obtain the Grand Dao Fragments?” Chen Xi couldn’t refrain from asking. Since the Dark Parasol’s Abyss only emerged into the world every 10,000 years, and they’d entered into it with great difficulty, he felt it would be too much of a pity if they only searched for and gathered some Grand Dao Fragments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, there wasn’t only the Dark Parasol Secret Realm within the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, and there were even more mysterious places like the Creation Sword Domain and the Door of Profundity. Their value was so great that it far exceeded the Dark Parasol Secret Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, besides these three great treasure troves, there was no guarantee that the other places of the Dark Parasol’s Abyss didn’t contain even more secrets and fortune that was waiting to be discovered and unearthed by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to head to the other places to try my luck as well. Unfortunately, according to my knowledge, the Heartcontrol Swordhouse and Truth Embrace Sect have already taken the Creation Sword Domain to be theirs, and they even possess many clues. They came to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss this time just for the sake of the Creation Sword Domain.” A wisp of a bitter smile suffused the corners of An Wei’s moist and brilliant lips. “Unfortunately, we don’t have much information related to the Creation Sword Domain in our possession. So, interfering rashly would probably draw a calamity onto us, and that would be really not worth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heartcontrol Swordhouse and Truth Embrace Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The images of the two top experts, Wen Daoran and Daoist Crimson Sun couldn’t help but appear in Chen Xi’s mind, and he couldn’t refrain from sighing with emotion.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Heartcontrol Swordhouse and Truth Embrace Sect are really worthy of being one of the 10 great immortal sects. They’re actually able to possess clues related to the Creation Sword Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his knowledge, the ranking of these two great powers amongst the 10 great immortal sects could enter the top five, whereas the Nine Radiance Sword Sect he was from was inferior, and it lingered at the end of the rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, the Nine Radiance Sword Sect stood proudly at the top amongst the 10 great immortal sects all those years ago. But regretfully, due to various reasons, it had gradually lost its former glory in the last thousand plus years, causing it to decline until its current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what about the Door of Profundity?” Chen Xi asked once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Wei couldn’t help but be stunned when she heard the words ‘Door of Profundity,’ but she shook her head resolutely right after and said, “No. That place is even more mysterious than the Creation Sword Domain, and it’s close to being a legend. Since the ancient times until now, countless great figures have come for it, yet returned empty handed and didn’t even have the fate to catch a glimpse of it. It’s practically impossible for us to locate it because there’s very little chances of success.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That might not be the case.” Long Zhenbei spoke out abruptly. “According to the information I obtained, the emergence of the Dark Parasol’s Abyss falls upon the time when the three dimensions are about to undergo an upheaval, and it’s extremely unusual. Some great figures who live in seclusion from the world deduced that a fortune that shakes the heavens will appear in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss this time, and it’s most probably related to the Door of Profundity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This news is actually true?” An Wei was surprised, and her cherry lips parted slightly while flowing lights flashed within her starry eyes, causing her to reveal an entirely different type of breathtaking beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course it’s true.” Long Zhenbei smiled proudly. A wisp of pride couldn’t help but gush out into his heart, and he felt extremely delighted when he saw his words were able to make An Wei so surprised and place her attention on him.</span></p>

Perhaps we’ll be able to obtain something.” An Wei blinked and felt slight anticipation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw the expression of hope on An Wei’s face vanished gradually, he hurriedly patted his chest and guaranteed. “Don’t worry, Junior Sister An Wei. This information can absolutely be relied on. Once we enter the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, and if you really want to go, then I’ll surely help you find the location of the Door of Profundity!”</span></p>

When he noticed that this fellow was innocently looking around into the surroundings, Long Zhenbei was uncontrollably furious in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bastard is simply a jinx!

Presently, Chen Xi had already stepped foot into the Dark Reverie, and he wasn’t the weak young man from before any longer. So the nickname ‘Jinx’ had naturally moved further and further away from him. It wasn’t just that, he’d already become a genius in the entire Darchu Dynasty that was like the sun in the midday sky, and his name was known throughout the world. He was already an existence that was impossible to reach in the hearts of the cultivators of the Darchu Dynasty.</span></p>

The man wore a golden long robe, had a tall figure, and his hair hung loosely behind his head. Numerous strange patterns that seemed like devils, yet weren’t devils, and seemed like demons, yet weren’t demons were embroidered on the golden long robe, and they formed numerous divine patterns that revealed a ghastly aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dark Parasol’s Abyss. It’s just nice for us to seize this opportunity and wipe out all the top disciples of the various powers of the Dark Reverie! After that, we’ll gather all the treasures in our hands!” A wisp of a savage and ruthless expression suffused the golden robed young man’s handsome face, and his gaze was like a blade while he seemed to be extremely vicious.</span></p>

It’s better to put everything else aside for now, so as to avoid exposing our identity.” The peerlessly gorgeous woman at the side was similarly in a golden robe. Her figure was graceful while her slender and plump thighs were even longer than an ordinary woman, and it caused her to seem graceful and gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Xuan Kui, there’s no need for you to remind me, I naturally know what’s important and what isn’t.” Xuan Chen grunted coldly as the ruthlessness and ghastly expression in his eyes grew denser, and then he licked his scarlet red lips as he said excitedly, “But with our strengths, we utterly don’t have to worry about exposing our identities even if we annihilate all these weak natives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Kui sighed lightly in her heart and didn’t speak further.</span></p>

Especially after they arrived in the Dark Reverie, he wished for nothing more than to annihilate everyone, and he was extremely ruthless and tyrannical. He was absolutely a madman that she was utterly incapable of dissuading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, we’ll put this matter aside until after we enter the Dark Parasol’s Abyss!” Xuan Chen flicked his sleeve and brought Xuan Kui along as he transformed into a cold gust of wind that silently vanished without a trace.</span></p>
