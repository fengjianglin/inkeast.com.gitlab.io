 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was only a sentence, yet it was like the enormous hammer of god of thunder that smashed onto the hearts of all, and it caused their entire bodies to tremble while the vital energy of those with slightly weaker strengths almost collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, Chen Xi was like a heavenly emperor that had descended into the world. His entire body glowed brilliantly with talisman markings and surging divine radiances, and a grab of his hand caused an expanse of mysterious and vast talisman markings to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged while he raised a single hand and suddenly pressed it forward. The talisman markings that were vast like a river of stars erupted with blazing light, and they were like clouds that fell from the heavens and crushed down towards Yan Shisan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could even dodge, his entire body felt as if a myriad of enormous mountains were pressing down onto him, and he was completely suppressed by those talisman markings to the point of kneeling down on the floor while spitting blood without end. No matter how he struggled, he was unable to resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this be possible!?</span></p>

Why has he not lost his cultivation, but become even more terrifying?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shisan’s entire body convulsed from pain while his countenance was pale to the point it was almost translucent, and he seemed as if he was on the verge of drowning to death. His entire body was suppressed to the point of being curled up on the ground while convulsing without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But compared to this pain, his heart was swallowed by an unprecedented feeling of terror and helplessness. At this moment, Chen Xi was simply too terrifying, and it caused him to simply have the feeling of despair he had when facing an Earthly Immortal Realm expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, kill me and you’ll be the greatest enemy of my Heavenflow Dao Sect! You’ll never be able to gain a foothold in the cultivation world after that!” Yan Shisan had a twisted expression as he roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he was called a madman and lusted madly for battle to the point of not recognizing his own kin while in battle, he still instinctively felt terror when facing death, and he was unwilling to die just like this, extremely unwilling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t even care about Bing Shitian, let alone you?” Chen Xi’s expression was indifferent, his eyes were deep and vast, and his figure was tall, and he emanated a bearing of supremacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You…” Yan Shisan’s entire body trembled violently while his face twisted, yet he was filled with the fear of death because he’d fallen into complete despair when facing a ruthless figure like Chen Xi who didn’t care about anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he flicked his sleeve, causing Yan Shisan’s corpse and the traces of blood on the ground to be completely wiped away and return its original state. Even the pavilion that was shaking violently had become peaceful once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Early on before the battle had begun, Chen Xi had utilized the Grand Confinement Dao Arts to seal up the space in the surroundings, otherwise, merely the short battle between his and Yan Shisan was sufficient to destroy this entire pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that way, he would be unable to avoid affecting Meng Wei and the others, and this was something he wasn’t willing to see happen.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan Shisan is dead!” After a short moment, an exclaim of shock resounded out within the silent atmosphere, and it was rather ear piercing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The breathing of the others sped up as well while their pupils dilated. They were both shocked and in disbelief, causing their expressions to be blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A peerless genius of the Heavenflow Dao Sect, a madman that was extremely renowned in the Dark Reverie was actually annihilated in less than a single strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who could have imagined that Yan Shisan would lose so swiftly and so completely, and he’d even lost his life in the process?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Senor Sister Wen and the other young women turned pale while their entire bodies felt icy cold as if they’d fallen into an icy pit, and a strand of regret that couldn’t be restrained arose in their hearts.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, if he’d suddenly made a move against us while we ridiculed him, then wouldn’t we have…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their bodies trembled because that sort of consequences was too severe, and they didn’t dare continue thinking about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Bai Gunan who was mentally prepared since the beginning was shocked greatly and almost leaped up.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Too ferocious, this fellow Chen Xi is simply too ferocious! Such a fierce figure like Yan Shisan was actually like a completely useless fellow that couldn’t withstand a single strike before him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Serve the food.” Meanwhile, Chen Xi had already returned to his seat with a tranquil expression, and he seemed as if what he’d done earlier was an exceedingly ordinary and trivial matter as he casually instructed the attendant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Al…alright. Wait…wait a moment.” The attendant seemed as if she’d awoken from a dream and replied with a stutter. Moreover, she walked weakly and staggered to the point of &nbsp;almost falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the hall finally recovered from their shock when they saw such an amusing scene, but they didn’t dare chat loudly. All of them looked carefully at Chen Xi’s tall figure with gazes that revealed deep reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he was able to slaughter Yan Shisan so easily, it caused them to be even more certain that this handsome young man before them was Chen Xi, because only a genius figure like Chen Xi would be capable of achieving all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there any trouble?” asked Meng Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Chen Xi shook his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the moment he decided to expose his identity, he knew that he must kill Yan Shisan, and there wasn’t another second choice at all, nor was there any room to maneuver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, strictly speaking, he had an irreconcilable relationship with the Heavenflow Dao Sect because of the relationship between him, Qin Xiuyi, and Bing Shitian, so it was utterly impossible to relieve their hostile relationship even if he didn’t kill Yan Shisan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So…sorry. We were wrong earlier. Fellow… Fellow Daoist, please forgive us.” Meanwhile, Senior Sister Wen and the others had stood up obediently and walked over to stand before Chen Xi, and then they lowered their heads and apologized.</span></p>

Truly brainless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior Sister Wen frowned but forcefully swallowed this anger in the end. They only hoped to seek Chen Xi’s forgiveness now, otherwise they would truly feel uneasy and terrified in their hearts.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Yan shook her head and said with a clear voice, “They didn’t apologize to me, Uncle Meng Wei, Aunty Mo Ya, Blackie, and the others, so I won’t forgive them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she’d spoken like this, Senior Sister Wen and the others would simply be brainless like Bai Gunan had said if they were unable to discern the meaning behind her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoists, it was we who were in the wrong this time. We apologize to all of you, please forgive us.” Senior Sister Wen and the others took a deep breath and spoke in low voices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, all of you can leave.” Chen Xi waved his hand and allowed them to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was the territory of the Heavenly Insight Palace. Even though the attitudes of these young women were detestable, yet their crime didn’t warrant death. So being able to force them to make such a stand was already alright. Not to mention Su Qingyan was still at the side, and they were her senior and junior sisters in the end, so she wouldn’t feel happy if he went too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Senior Sister Wen and the others seemed as if they’d been relieved of a heavy burden, and they turned and left right away because they weren’t willing to stay for another moment here. The loss of face this time was nothing, and the main issue was the death of Yan Shisan. It was impossible for them to escape being related to it, so the pressing moment at hand was to quickly leave this place and hide in their sect before doing anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you.” At this moment, Su Qingyan walked over trippingly. Her skin was tender and white like snow, her appearance gorgeous, and she was like a celestial maiden that was untainted by the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I only lifted a hand. In any case, you didn’t like Yan Shisan as well, whereas he’s my enemy. So killing him can be said to be killing two birds with one stone.” Chen Xi stood up and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not talking about all this.” Su Qingyan shook her head as her clear eyes glowed, and she looked at Chen Xi as she said seriously, “The things that made me the most grateful was that you were able to let my senior and junior sisters off because of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there any need for courtesy between the two of us?” Chen Xi was stunned as he never imagined that Su Qingyan would place such emphasis on it, and he invited. “Don’t just stand there, why don’t you sit down and have a drink with us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I have to return quickly because those senior and junior sisters of mine…” Su Qingyan shook her head and smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Alright then, take care.” Chen Xi frowned before coming to an understanding. Perhaps the death of Yan Shisan was nothing to him, but it was an extremely severe matter for these disciples of the Heavenly Insight Palace. At this moment, if Su Qingyan were to continue sitting with him, then it would probably be misunderstood by others and bring trouble to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You too.” Su Qingyan nodded before bending down to pull off the red string on her ankle, and she said with a relaxed tone, “This was tied on me by my mother when I was born. In my hometown, it implies blessings and happiness. I hope you can keep it and take it as a token of my gratitude.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, she placed the red string on the table before turning and leaving trippingly, and she utterly didn’t give Chen Xi the chance to refuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and he watched as Su Qingyan’s figure vanished before picking up the red string on the table. The red string was fine and bright like flames, and it carried a trace of a women’s warmth that lingered on his fingertips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, this wouldn’t be a token of love?” Bai Gunan grinned from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi put the red string away carefully before glancing at Bai Gunan, and then he said, “Believe it or not, I’ll throw you out if you dare say another word.”</span></p>

That stubborn old geezer has actually gone on strike, and he won’t cook ‘Let Ability Shine’ no matter what. Even I was unable to change his mind. Would you like to choose a different dish?”</span></p>
