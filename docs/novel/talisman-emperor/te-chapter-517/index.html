Supposedly, the emissaries of the Dark Reverie are from the various ancient powers, and all of them have cultivations at the Earthly Immortal Realm. Now that I’ve seen them, they really do deserve their reputation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We must make a good display.

At this moment, all the cultivators in the city revealed excited expressions and were burning with eagerness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them were top figures of the younger generation of the various Dynasties, and they’d overcome all difficulties and experienced danger after danger all along their way here. Wasn’t all of this for the sake of obtaining the recognition of an emissary and being brought into the vast and gorgeous large world that was the Dark Reverie?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, when they saw the emissaries of the Dark Reverie arriving here, the excitement and anticipation in their hearts was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the sudden appearance of the emissaries had eased up the tense and confrontational atmosphere between Chen Xi and Feng Jianbai, causing the gazes of everyone present to move towards the 10 plus figures in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even Qing Xiuyi who insisted on killing Feng Jianbai had given up this thought, and she and Zhen Liuqing brought Chen Xi away from Feng Jianbai and to a safe place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Jianbai didn’t obstruct them, as he utterly didn’t have the courage to start a battle under the gazes of the emissaries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the conversation between Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing from before had almost tortured him to the point of burning up from within, and he even eagerly looked forward to Chen Xi leaving as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

Compared to the other people, she seemed to be indifferent towards the emissaries, and all her thoughts were on Chen Xi. As she spoke, she’d already started to help Chen Xi wipe off the traces of blood on his body and clean his wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she clearly knew that these injuries weren’t sufficient to be fatal to Chen Xi and he only required some time to swiftly recover, she still couldn’t help but do this, and her actions were gentle, as if she was deeply afraid of causing Chen Xi pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt slightly uncomfortable, and he said embarrassedly, “There’s no need to go to such lengths, I’ll recover very quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing’s clear eyes spun before she glared angrily at him. “Be still, what’s there to feel embarrassed about!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby Qing Xiuyi was stunned as she watched Zhen Liuqing carefully helping Chen Xi clean his wounds, and then her beautiful brows knit together slightly as she seemed to have made an extremely huge decision. With a flip of her delicate hand, a jade white bottle appeared, and she passed it to Zhen Liuqing and said, “This is some Divine Pinkdew Powder, and its medicinal effect isn’t bad. It’s capable of recovering injuries and physical strength. Help him put some on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, her gaze never left Zhen Liuqing, and she’d never spared a glance at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this caused Chen Xi to be extremely shocked in his heart. Never had he imagined that Qing Xiuyi would actually start being concerned about him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it’s merely a bottle of medicinal powder, yet doesn’t it display that…she doesn’t hate me anymore in her heart?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, Chen Xi suddenly felt indescribable happiness, and a trace of a smile couldn’t help but appear on the corners of his mouth. The change in Qing Xiuyi’s attitude towards him was undoubtedly a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really seem happy, huh?!” Zhen Liuqing glanced at Chen Xi before opening up the jade bottle. A strand of a cold flow of air that was like icy mist and carries a refreshing fragrance gushed out from within before it was lightly grabbed by her delicate hand, and then she slapped it into Chen Xi’s wounds and started rubbing fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An icy cold and bone piercing coldness moved along his wounds and instantly spread throughout his body, causing Chen Xi to be unable to help but tremble as he looked at Zhen Liuqing with a peculiar gaze.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is she jealous?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing was staring at Chen Xi to the point her beautiful face flushed red, and she lowered her head in embarrassment. She stared at the injuries on Chen Xi’s body as she carefully wiped them, and her movements had once again become gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Qing Xiuyi stood alone and silently at the side. Her black hair flowed down like a waterfall while her slender and graceful figure was enveloped in a layer of hazy mist, and it caused her bearing to seem even more aloof from the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those are the emissaries of the Dark Reverie?” Chen Xi raised his head and looked at the emissaries that were like numerous suns in the sky, and he couldn’t help but ask curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, these 13 people have all come from different powers of the Dark Reverie. They came to the Dark Reverie this time for the sake of presiding over the final test in the Primeval Battlefield, and those that become eminent in the test will be able to obtain a Dark Reverie Token and smoothly enter the Dark Reverie.” To Chen Xi’s shock, it wasn’t Zhen Liuqing that answered him, but Qing Xiuyi. Her voice was lofty and ethereal as it resounded lightly in his ears like the sound of wind chimes in a valley, and it was indescribably pleasing to the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If one is able to obtain the favor of these emissaries, then not only would one be able to obtain the qualifications to enter the Dark Reverie, one would even be recruited as a disciple of their sects, and this a form of temptation that’s irresistible to most cultivators.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But Chen Xi, our situation will probably not be good.” Right at this moment, Zhen Liuqing suddenly raised her head and said, “Most of the emissaries have an intimate relationship with the disciples of some Dynasties, and the Shang Clan is naturally no exception. Since you’ve killed so many members of the Shang Clan and have practically uprooted it, there’ll probably be someone that looks for trouble with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chen Xi’s brows raised as he asked. “Could it be that as emissaries of the Dark Reverie, they dare arbitrarily make a move against us juniors?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They wouldn’t under most circumstances, but we have to be on guard against the occurrence of such an incident.” Meanwhile, Zhen Liuqing had already finished helping Chen Xi clean his wounds, and she patted her hands together then said after pondering for a moment, “Not to mention that if the emissaries of the Dark Reverie want to deal with anyone, they utterly don’t have to make a move themselves. They just have to casually think of a method to give you a hard time, and it would be sufficient to cause you to be eternally doomed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt apprehensive in his heart and seemed to be lost in thought as he said, “It’s easy to dodge a thrust from a spear in the open, but it’s difficult to evade an arrow shot from the darkness. If such a thing really does occur, then it would really be rather troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll absolutely not allow it if they dare go against you.” Qing Xiuyi suddenly spoke, and her starry and deep eyes revealed a firm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned as a warm feeling arose in his heart, and then he laughed lightheartedly. “Who cares about them? We’ll resolve the situation when it arises. We’ve already come all this way, I don’t believe we’ll be unable to get past the final test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, an old man with a fluttering violet beard and a gaze that was like lightning suddenly took a step out from amongst the 10 plus emissaries of the Dark Reverie in the sky, and an extremely terrifying aura surged out explosively from his entire body to envelop the entire city, causing everyone to shut up in unison and the clamorous noise to be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He spoke in a deep voice upon seeing this. “I presume all of you have already guessed our identities. According to convention, the final test of the Primeval Battlefield will begin three months from now, but the situation is special this time. We’ll activate the final test a month from now, so all of you should prepare as soon as possible.”</span></p>

Could it be that some sort of unexpected event has occurred?”</span></p>

Looks like we must prepare properly. I heard the final test is different every single time. I wonder what the test will be this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the cultivators within the city were stunned when they heard this, and then they exploded into an uproar as they were extremely puzzled by the final test being brought forward by two months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the violet bearded old man wouldn’t explain it to them. After he announced this matter, he nodded to the emissaries by his side before heading swiftly towards Primeval City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xue Ranchen greets Ancestor Zi Ming!” Right at this moment, a figure flashed up kowtowing towards the violet bearded old man in midair. Shockingly, it was the Xue Clan’s Xue Ranchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mmm, I know you. You’re the leader of this generation, right?” The violet bearded old man nodded with a smile, and his attitude was pleasantly warm as he waved his hand and said, “Rise and lead the way. I heard from your grandfather that the natural talent of all the disciples that have entered Primeval City this time are extraordinary. Let me see if it’s true.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Xue Ranchen stood up right away before leading the violet bearded old man away in a respectful and reverent manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t only Xue Ranchen, there were numerous figures that flashed out from other places in Primeval City, and they kowtowed to the emissaries while revealing intimate relationships.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, the disciples of these Dynasties had a rather intimate relationship with the emissaries of the Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Chen Xi noticed that these emissaries had practically taken away all the disciples of the powers like the three top Dynasties, and it was basically unrelated to the ordinary Dynasties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to Chen Xi’s surprise, at this moment, there were two emissaries flashing over towards the area where he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was a grey clothed hawked nosed and gaunt old man that had thin lips, and his face was covered with wrinkles. Within his sunken eye sockets were a pair of eyes that seemed bright and profound like lightning, and they emitted shocking divine light as his eyes opened and closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side was a white haired and handsome young man with a tall and graceful figure. However, he only wore an extremely simple handwoven robe, and his snow white hair fluttered behind his back while suffused with strands of a peculiar sheen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially his eyes were deep, magnificent, and actually emanated an aura of experience and ancientness, causing him to seem as if he’d fully experienced the rise and fall of the world and the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Each generation is worse than the previous, where’re the disciples of the Shang Clan!? Why hasn’t a single person come to greet me?” The grey clothed old man’s gaze was like bolts of lightning as it coldly swept past Chen Xi and the others, and he couldn’t help but grunt coldly when he noticed that there weren’t any disciples of the Shang Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of Chen Xi and the others instantly jerked when they heard this, and they felt the situation was far from good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the spectators in the distance that hadn’t left couldn’t help but reveal strange expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancestor Ling Ya! You’ve finally arrived!” Right when the grey clothed old man had just finished speaking, a figure swiftly flashed over from the distance, and then the figure knelt down with a thump upon arriving before the grey clothed old man and howled sorrowfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, this person was Shang Que.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorrowful and rueful, could it be that you’ve encountered some sort of mishap? Speak, what exactly happened!?” The grey clothed old man’s gaze was extremely discerning, and he instantly understood something from Shang Que’s miserable expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s him! It’s him! He cruelly killed all the other disciples of my Shang Clan, and even the Young Master…didn’t survive!” Shang Que turned around to stare resentfully at the distant Chen Xi as he spoke while gnashing his teeth.</span></p>
