 <p>Chapter 174 – Sword Visualization Stone</p>
 <p>Chen Xi thought for a moment before cupping his fist towards Qing Qiu. “Big Brother Qing Qiu, this young man passed the test of will earlier, yet his position was replaced by someone called Liu Chen, and it’s extremely unfair. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, leave it to me.” Qing Qiu agreed readily and said, “I’ve just taken up a new official post and I just happen to be worrying about how to open up a new prospect. Using this as a turning point is a good choice. In any case, I’m not familiar with any of the other elders in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. So if anyone wants to pass through the test of will, they have to display real ability, and wanting to do nothing, yet enjoy the spoils of others by relying on their relationships is utterly impossible here!”</p>
 <p>Chen Xi said with a smile, “Perhaps the Sect Master Ling Kongzi arranged for you to come here precisely for the sake of using this opportunity to rectify the malpractices in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. Big Brother, I support your decision in doing this, and I presume Big Brother Bei Heng would support your decision as well.”</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll thank you greatly in advance.” Qing Qiu held a smile on his face as he nodded. Speaking with a person like Chen Xi was simple and direct as he was intelligent and easily understood things, and he knew deeply of the way of giving and receiving favors.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Senior Chen Xi. Zhu Xun will never forget Senior’s great kindness for my entire life.” When the young man from a family of hunters saw that Chen Xi had helped him get through his difficult position with a few words, his dark face was covered in excitement and happiness, and he knelt on the floor right away as he spoke with a firm voice.</p>
 <p>“Arise, this is something you ought to obtain, and I haven’t helped you with anything. You have to walk down your future path by yourself, did you hear me?” Chen Xi nodded before raising his hand, and a shapeless energy supported Zhu Xun’s body up.</p>
 <p>“So long I’m allowed to cultivate, I’m able to endure more hardships than anyone, and I’ll surely not let Senior down.” Zhu Xun puckered his lips tightly and nodded fiercely.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi smiled and said no more, and after he bid his farewells to Qing Qiu, he brought along Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei to the Sword Visualization Stone to test their comprehension ability.</p>
 <p>The Sword Visualization Stone was a glossy stone wall that covered an area of 30 meters, and above it was countless marks from swords that crisscrossed both horizontally and vertically. These marks were left behind by the countless extraordinary Sword Immortal experts of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect for a few tens of thousands of years, and every single mark contained a trace of the profundity of the Sword Dao, causing it to be profound, unfathomable, and extraordinarily mighty.</p>
 <p>During the past tens of thousands of years, an innumerable number of disciples had attained sudden enlightenment in a Supreme Sword Dao before this Sword Visualization Stone.</p>
 <p>But the Sword Visualization Stone was a restricted area of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, and only Elite Disciples were able to freely come here to comprehend and visualize it. As for Inner Court disciples and Outer Court disciples, unless they’d comprehended Sword Insight, they’d have no fortune in visualizing the Sword Visualizing Stone.</p>
 <p>After all, their strength was low, and their comprehension towards the Sword Dao was insufficient. If they still forcefully comprehended the Sword Visualization Stone’s Sword Dao profundities, it would only cause them to be affected by inner demons and even suffer a backlash that led to qi deviation, and their end would be exceedingly tragic.</p>
 <p>The Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s test of comprehension was set before the Sword Visualization Stone, and so long as one was able to execute any one of the sword moves contained within the Sword Dao profundities on the stone, the person would be considered to have passed.</p>
 <p>Actually, it was no different than copying from a painting, and the more sword moves one was able to execute, it proved that one’s comprehension ability was higher.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was an extremely great danger in this. Comprehending a sword move from a Sword Dao’s profundity to an ordinary person wasn’t strenuous, but to comprehend many different swords moves from many types of Sword Daos was too difficult. After all, these Sword Dao profundities were left behind by different Sword Immortal experts, and each of these Sword Daos was different. Trying to comprehend a few types of sword moves in a short period of time was easily able to cause one’s vital energy to become chaotic, cause one’s mind to collapse, and suffer from qi deviation.</p>
 <p>Due to the Sword Visualization Stone being a restricted area of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, only the young men and young women that were participating in the test of comprehension were able to enter, and as for their family and guards, they were instead disallowed from approaching a step closer.</p>
 <p>Most of these seniors and guards of the young disciples had extremely deep cultivations, and there was surely no lack of people with exceedingly high comprehension ability amongst them. If they were allowed to enter, then what would the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect do if they were able to comprehend the various Supreme Sword Dao profundities on the Sword Visualization Stone?</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was extremely curious towards the Sword Visualization Stone as well, but for the sake of avoiding any complaints, he didn’t enter in the end and only asked Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei to not worry and enter.</p>
 <p>The Sword Visualization Stone was situated at the side of a mountain. Outside it was numerous elders guarding it, and an unknown amount of grand formations had been set up within, and its defense was exceedingly strong. Only young disciples that held command tokens were able to be sent in after being verified by those elders.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there were a few thousand seniors and guards that were staying on the empty space at the mountainside and raised their heads to look.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi swept his gaze and noticed to his surprise that Dong Fang and Wang Wan were here as well, and he thought to himself. <i>Looks like their younger brother and younger sister aren’t people that lack both skill and ability, they’ve actually passed the test of will…</i></p>
 <p>Dong Fang and Wang Wan had noticed Chen Xi as well, and they hurriedly jogged over and were about to greet him with a bow when they were instead signaled by Chen Xi with a shake of his head.<i> What a joke, if they called me Supreme Ancestor before so many people, then it would be like I’m showing off. </i></p>
 <p>“How was it? How was the test of your younger brother and younger sister?” Chen Xi smiled as he asked.</p>
 <p>“Not bad, that kid’s natural endowments are not bad, He’s just too mischievous and arrogant. After the incident from yesterday, perhaps he’ll be able to restrain his disposition and devote his heart to the cultivation of the Dao.” Dong Fang spoke respectfully.</p>
 <p>“My younger sister is the same: arrogant, conceited, and looks down on everyone. The lesson from yesterday is a good thing for her. Otherwise, once she goes out to gain experience and tempering, she might not even know the reason why she was killed.” Wang Wan replied respectfully as well.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi smiled and said suddenly, “I might be leaving True Heart Peak tomorrow to go out and gain experience and tempering, and it will be at least five years. All of you should be fine while cultivating on True Heart Peak with Supreme Elder Bei Heng looking after all of you, but you can’t trouble him for everything. So when you’re free, pay more visits to Elder Xuan Jing and Elder Qing Qiu. The both of them have deep friendships with me, and they’ll surely help all of you.”</p>
 <p>Dong Fang and Wang Wan were stunned, and they were hesitant to speak.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to ask any further. The True Heart Peak is the place I cultivated concentratedly in for all these years. After I’ve finished with all my affairs, then I’ll surely return if nothing unexpected happens. Otherwise, wouldn’t all of you become lonely and helpless people that nobody wants?” Chen Xi smiled.</p>
 <p>Dong Fang and Wang Wan’s hearts went warm, and they felt even more unwilling for Chen Xi to leave.</p>
 <p>Since they entered True Heart Peak, their lives could be said to have undergone a tremendous change. The height of their status and the greatness of the treatment they enjoyed was even comparable to some Elite Disciples. Moreover, Chen Xi was extremely nice. He’d never been bossy and ordered them around, and he’d never taken them to be servants. It could be said that these few years of cultivating at True Heart Peak was simply like being in heaven for them and the other 70 Inner Court disciples. They had a carefree life of freedom, and they only needed to devote their hearts to cultivating.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of this that they thought of how good Chen Xi was even more, and they naturally would be unwilling for Chen Xi to leave. This was perhaps called reliance.</p>
 <p>After the time for an incense stick to burn, Dong Xuanhong and Wang Yunshi both walked out from the Sword Visualization Stone’s area, and they were in high spirits and beaming with joy. Obviously, they’d performed extraordinarily in the test of comprehension.</p>
 <p>But when they saw Chen Xi, who stood by the side of their brother and sister, the spirited expressions on their faces instantly vanished, and they lowered their heads, shut their mouths, and were trembling in fear as if they were mice that had seen a cat.</p>
 <p>“All of you can leave first, I still have to wait for Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei.” Chen Xi wasn’t willing to meet with these two little arrogant children of the powerful as well. He’d only just fiercely taught them a lesson yesterday, and now that they’d met again now, could it be that he could teach them a lesson again?</p>
 <p>Dong Fang and Wang Wan urgently wanted to know how their younger brother and younger sister had performed, so they didn’t decline right away and brought Dong Xuanhong and Wang Yunshi to leave.</p>
 <p>After another two hours, Chen Xi still didn’t see Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei come out, whereas, it was already dusk, and the sect entrance test today was about to end.</p>
 <p><i>Could it be that the two of them have met with an accident inside there?</i></p>
 <p>Chen Xi swept his gaze towards the surroundings and noticed only a few family members were still waiting on the empty ground, but in next to no time, their children had come out successively before leaving. Instantly, only he remained.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chen Xi was unable to continue waiting any longer, and he moved forward towards the entrance at the mountainside.</p>
 <p>“Stop, this place it the restricted area of my Wanderingcloud Sword Sect…” An Inner Court disciple’s shouter out with a deep voice.</p>
 <p>How could Chen Xi have the mood to listen to his nonsense? Chen Xi withdrew a command token from his pocket right away before tossing it over.</p>
 <p>This command token was like iron yet not iron, like jade yet not jade, and it had a lifelike little sword with an imposing aura that was like lightning inscribed on it. It was precisely the authenticating token he’d obtained from Bei Heng on their first meeting.</p>
 <p>This Inner Court disciple was stunned as he obviously didn’t recognize the meaning this command token represented, and he turned to look at the black robed elder by his side. Yet he saw the black robe elder sweep his gaze on the command token before his originally indifferent and reserved expression instantly vanished, and he stood up with a thump and bowed respectfully. “Disciple Liu Ang greets Supreme Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>As an elder, Liu Ang had once heard that the Supreme Elder Bei Heng had passed his command token to his sworn brother, Chen Xi. Now, as soon as he saw the command token and matched it with Chen Xi’s appearance, how could he be unable to guess that this person was the reputed owner of True Heart Peak?</p>
 <p>“Supreme Ancestor.” When they saw Elder Liu Ang bow, all the other elders shuddered as they stood up and bowed. Whereas the other Inner Court disciples had been dumbstruck by this scene long ago, and they hurriedly bowed towards Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry for troubling everyone, I just want to know if the comprehension ability test had ended now?” Chen Xi nodded and asked directly. Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei had once suffered the obstruction of Elder Hua Hong earlier, and if they suffered any mishap at the Sword Visualization Stone, then how horrible would that be?</p>
 <p>“Supreme Ancestor, the test has already ended.” Liu Ang replied respectfully.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi frowned. “Two of my friends are still inside, so how could it have possibly ended? Move aside, I want to go in and take a look.” As soon as he finished speaking, Chen Xi walked forward into the area.</p>
 <p>Liu Ang and the others were stunned, yet they didn’t dare obstruct him, and they instead hurriedly made various seals to open up a path in the layer upon layer of grand formations for Chen Xi to safely pass through.</p>
 <p>The passageway was coiled in light and emitted a mysterious aura. Chen Xi’s footsteps were like the wind as his figure flashed for an entire 15 minutes before stepping into a spacious great hall that was built deep in the mountainside.</p>
 <p>This great hall covered an entire 3k in area, it had four enormous pillars that were sculpted with dragons and phoenixes holding up the sky. Its floor was covered with smooth and neat limestone, and its four walls had fist sized moonlight stones hanging on them. The moonlight stones emitted a gentle and clear radiance that illuminated the entire great hall to be completely bright and dazzling.</p>
 <p>At the depths of the great hall was an enormous stone wall that was glossy like a mirror, and atop it was boundless amounts of sword lights fluttering about, whistling and flowing like rainbows and bolts of lightning as they sprayed and shot out violently, and they were extremely miraculous.</p>
 <p>Obviously, this was the Sword Visualization Stone, and the sword lights that flowed about as if they possessed intelligence was surely the Sword Dao profundities left behind by the peerless Sword Immortals of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect for the past tens of thousands of years.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there were six Wanderingcloud Sword Sect elders sitting cross-legged on the ground before the Sword Visualization Stone, whereas at their center sat Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei.</p>
 <p><i>What’re they doing?</i></p>
 <p>Right when Chen Xi was wondering, a familiar voice suddenly sounded out by his ear. “Chen Xi, I’m helping my two disciples to clear the impurities in their bodies and develop their Sword Hearts. It will be done in the time it takes an incense stick to burn. During this period of time, you can observe the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s Sword Visualization Stone. Perhaps it will be of great benefit to you.”</p>
 <p><i>Daoist Wen Xuan!</i></p>
 <p>Chen Xi raised his eyes to look, and sure enough, Chen Xi saw that the elder that had his back towards him was exactly Daoist Wen Xuan!</p>
 <p>At this point, Chen Xi could finally heave a sigh of relief, and then he glanced in astonishment at Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei before thinking to himself. <i>Daoist Wen Xuan actually made an exception and took these two as his disciples, and he’s even clearing the impurities in their bodies and developing their Sword Heart. This can be considered to be an extremely great fortune as well.</i></p>
 <p>Chen Xi shook his head and walked towards the Sword Visualization Stone. The instant he raised his head to view it, his gaze was instantly firmly drawn by the various Sword Dao profundities on the Sword Visualization Stone.</p>
