 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi had a calm expression and wasn’t surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the moment he’d killed Luo Shaonong and the others, he was clearly aware that he would definitely face tremendous trouble upon leaving the Desolate Manku Ruins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He even faintly suspected that the clans standing behind Luo Shaonong, Gongye Zhefu, Di Jun, Yue Ruhuo, Jin Qingyang, Kunwu Qing, and Pei Wen had already become clearly aware of the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was even to the extent that he couldn’t rule out that these top-rate powers from the Imperial Region had already set out and had set up a tight encirclement at the shores of God Burial Ocean that lay before Phoenix Perch City!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chen Xi wasn’t afraid of this. Presently, no one besides Jia Nan was aware of exactly who had killed Luo Shaonong and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an opportunity to Chen Xi because so long as he was able to escape before they completed their investigations, then he would be able to avoid encountering all sorts of lethal disasters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely because of this that Chen Xi had hurried off to leave and hadn’t stopped upon returning from Violetsky Dao Palace, and he’d done this for the sake of making the best use of his time to leave the ‘crime scene’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for the reminder, Senior.” Chen Xi cupped his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like you already have a plan.” The temple guardian seemed to be lost in thought as he glanced at Chen Xi. “That’s good. Make the best use of your time once you’ve left this place and absorb the Imperial Sovereign Dao Root. In this way, unless an expert at the Imperial Monarch Realm makes a move against you, otherwise, no one in this world would be able to pose a threat to you any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial Monarch Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a realm above the Universe Enlightened Ancestral God Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Figures like these were like peerless imperial monarchs that resided in the numerous regions of the Ancient God Domain, and they possessed the qualifications to seize the position of Region Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, the Region Lord of Snow Ink Region, Empress Yu Che, and the Region Lord of South Pole Region, Emperor Gou Chen were both existences of such level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course.” Chen Xi nodded because that was exactly what he’d planned to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his current combat strength, he didn’t even have to fear experts at the Universe Enlightened Ancestral God Realm. However, if he encountered figures at the Imperial Monarch Realm, they his strength would be far from sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, improving his strength by advancing into the Universe Enlightened Ancestral God Realm had become the important matter at hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, Chen Xi had already condensed an Ultimate Divine Dao Altar, and his cultivation had attained the limits of the Domain Enlightened Spirit God Realm. It had arrived at an unprecedented state that reigned supreme throughout the ages. Moreover, he’d obtained the Imperial Sovereign Dao Root earlier, so it could be said that he was fully prepared and only lacked an opportune moment to break through and attain the Universe Enlightened Ancestral God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re simply too longwinded. With me here by his side, it wouldn’t be easy for this kid to die even if he wanted to. So, is there any reason for you to be worried about it?” Senior White grunted coldly and was very disdainful towards the temple guardian’s actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temple guardian disregarded Senior White once more. He seemed to have gained a complete understanding of Senior White’s character since a long time ago, and he couldn’t even be bothered to speak with Senior White.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since it’s like that, then go on ahead.” The temple guardian realized that Chen Xi was even calmer than he’d expected, and this allowed him to feel much more relaxed and gratified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the temple guardian. He’d become accustomed to watching storms brew and erupt, and he was clearly aware that Chen Xi who possessed the inheritance of the River Diagram was just like Xuan from the Manku period. Chen Xi’s path towards the Dao was utterly not something that an old fellow like him could comment on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their paths were bound to be unlike the other cultivators in the world, so they could only tread on it themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior.” Chen Xi suddenly asked. “May I know if you know the Divine Black Lich Venom?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temple guardian’s eyes narrowed, and then he shook his head and said after a long time, “Such a secret technique was passed down from the last era. If you intend to find a method to cure it, then perhaps you must make a trip to the Imperial Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial Region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s heart shook, and then he took a deep breath and cupped his hands as he said, “Thank you for your guidance, Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go on, the path towards the Grand Dao is difficult. But so long as the Dao Heart remains strong, you’ll be able to achieve anything. Take care of yourself.” The temple guardian smiled lightly, and his aged face was covered in an encouraging expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Fellow, I’m leaving. You stay here all by yourself forever. Hahaha!!!” Senior White roared complacently with laughter instead and seemed extremely self-satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temple guardian chuckled and shook his head without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short moment, a simply and bright golden divine gourd carried Chen Xi and the others as it tore through the sky, and it instantly charged into the area enveloped by Desolate Manku Qi and vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, if this kid doesn’t die young, then the ultimate path towards the Dao is bound to not be too lonely….” The temple guardian watched the divine gourd leave before muttering to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, his brows knit together while his expression instantly returned to its indifferent state from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that a wave of fluctuation arose from the doors of ‘life’ and ‘death’ before the divine temple, and then numerous figures swarmed out from within the doors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shockingly, it was all the cultivators that had fled out from the Ancestral Root Grounds. However, only Luo Shaonong’s group wasn’t present amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The saddest fact was that even until this very moment, all of these cultivators that fled the Ancestral Root Grounds had still not figured out exactly what had occurred within the Violetsky Dao Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was even to the extent that they were utterly unaware of the Door of the Grand Dao’s existence. So, they were naturally unaware that an Imperial Sovereign Dao Root which was even more formidable than the ninth-grade Emperor Rank Ancestral Dao Root existed within Master Xuan’s Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no matter what, they’d escaped safely in the end, and compared to those cultivators that had perished in the Ancestral Root Grounds, it could be considered to be a form of fortune as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the path back from the Ancestral Root Divine Temple, they had to pass through that area enveloped by Desolate Manku Qi and traverse the Chaos Beast Boundary that was filled with danger before they could arrive within the initial area of the Desolate Manku Ruins. After that, they had to traverse the God Burial Ocean after leaving the Desolate Manku Ruins before finally returning to Phoenix Perch City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only by arriving at Phoenix Perch City could they be considered to have returned to the Ancient God Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely this entire process would at least require a month of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, while Le Wuhen controlled the Soulsever Bottle Gourd, Shentu Yanran couldn’t restrain herself from asking. “Chen Xi, did you really obtain the Imperial Sovereign Dao Root?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others shot their gazes over in succession when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded. There was no need to conceal this because Le Wuhen and the others would definitely find out about it later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they obtained a confirmed answer, Le Wuhen and the others still couldn’t avoid feeling shock and slight disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then… haven’t Luo Shaonong and the others failed already?” Le Wuhen pursued even more answers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Chen Xi pondered deeply for a moment. In the end, he described everything that occurred on Master Xuan’s Divine Mountain in a concise manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished speaking, the surroundings were already deathly silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had their eyes wide open while revealing astounded expressions, and unprecedentedly tempestuous waves were roiling within their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhen Liuqing had suffered misfortune, and Chen Xi slaughtered Luo Shaonong and the others in rage, causing blood to cover the peak of Master Xuan’s Divine Mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This piece of information was like a thunderclap amidst a clear bright sky, and it shocked them to the point their entire bodies stiffened while they were unable to recover from their shock for a long time. If they hadn’t heard this from Chen Xi himself, they would probably not dare believe it no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, if Luo Shaonong and Gongye Zhefu were included, Chen Xi had an entire seven enemies during the battle, and every single one of them was a renowned existence that was ranked on the Domain Enlightened Chart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet Chen Xi had actually slaughtered all of them by himself. Would anyone dare to believe of such heaven-defying combat strength even if news of this were to spread to the Ancient God Domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi didn’t speak about his experiences within Master Xuan’s Divine Palace in detail, and he didn’t reveal that when compared to the time he annihilated Luo Shaonong’s group, his combat strength had undergone another tremendous transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was fortunate that he hadn’t spoken about this, otherwise, Le Wuhen and the others would definitely go mad with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Senior White didn’t speak with ridicule. It combed its feathers in a carefree manner while glancing at Le Wuhen and the others with a proud and satisfied expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed as if it really enjoyed this feeling of watching everyone be shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long time passed, Senior White instantly felt bored when it noticed that Le Wuhen and the others still showed no signs of recovering from their shock, and it cried out with disdain. “What a bunch of frogs that lay at the bottom of a well. All of you’ve still too inexperienced and young!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Le Wuhen and the others were instantly jolted back to their senses, and they revealed slightly embarrassed expressions from being ridiculed by Senior White.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi, what do you intend to do after this?” Le Wuhen took a deep breath and revealed a wisp of a solemn expression. “Killing Luo Shaonong and the others is equivalent to completely offending the powers that stand behind them. When we return to Phoenix Perch City this time, I’m afraid….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s there to be afraid of? According to what Chen Xi said, only Jia Nan knows of this matter. So, if we act as if we’re unaware of this matter, then would anyone know that it was Chen Xi who did it?” Yuqiu Jing grunted coldly as he spoke. “I don’t believe those old bastards would dare to make a move against Chen Xi without discriminating between right and wrong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others nodded in succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just as Yuqiu Jing had said. Besides Jia Nan and them, no one else was aware that it was Chen Xi who’d done this. Thus, so long as Chen Xi left Phoenix Perch City before those great powers found out the truth and lay low for a while, then no one would be able to do anything to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The true danger might already be laying in wait before Phoenix Perch City.” Le Wuhen sighed in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need to worry. The powers that stand behind us have probably already been alarmed because of the deaths of Luo Shaonong’s group, so they’d definitely dispatch some forces to support us. At that time, so long as Chen Xi follows by our sides, then would anyone dare to suspect him?” Shentu Yanran grinned, and her clear eyes were suffused with a wisp of confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly, exactly. There’s no need to fear those powers with all of us here.” The others spoke successively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was in terms of personal combat strength, then they were naturally inferior. However, if it was a competition between the forces that stood behind them, then most of them were unafraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, all of them were from top-rate powers in the Imperial Region, so would any one of them be inferior from the other?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, doing this would be equivalent to standing on Chen Xi’s side, so if the powers that stood behind Luo Shaonong and the others found out the truth in the future, then they would naturally have to endure an extremely great amount of danger and risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Le Wuhen and the others were already determined at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief in his heart and feel extremely touched when he heard all of this. Earlier, he’d told of them the truth because he wanted to probe their reactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Le Wuhen and the others became fearful and kept their distance from him because of this, then Chen Xi wouldn’t blame any one of them, and he would just leave by himself to endure all of this. But this meant that they were bound to be strangers in the future and would be unable to remain as friends any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was very obvious that Le Wuhen and the others hadn’t acted in this way, and this was more than enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, please hear me out. If I’m able to escape this predicament this time, then please severe all relations with me, so as to avoid implicating yourselves and the clans that stand behind all of you.” Chen Xi took a deep breath before he spoke in a serious manner. He was extremely touched by Le Wuhen and the others’ willingness to take a risk without hesitation and help him. However, he would naturally not just watch as they did this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi! What do you mean by that? Are you looking down on us?” Yuqiu Jing’s face sank, and he spoke furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Yuqiu, don’t misunderstand Chen Xi. He’s just asking us to keep a distance from him on the surface, and we’re still friends in secret. In this way, we’ll be able to reduce the risk and dangers we face to a minimum.” Shentu Yanran had seen through Chen Xi’s intentions, and she explained in a light voice.</span></p>
