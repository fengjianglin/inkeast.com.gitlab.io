 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he advanced to the Half-step Immortal King Realm, Chen Xi felt that the greatest change in him was in his Immortal Force. It had transformed from the originally clear colored energy of Saint Immortals to strands of dark gold energy of Immortal Kings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single strand of dark gold Immortal King Energy was filled with extremely terrifying might, and merely a single strand was capable of smashing a mountain apart. Space was unable to withstand its weight, and the heavens and the earth were unable to bear the brunt of its force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if it wasn’t true Immortal King Energy, it already possessed a trace of an Immortal King’s might, and it was entirely not something a Saint Immortal could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Immortal Force possessed by a Saint Immortal was a vast ocean, then the Immortal Force possessed by Half-step Immortal Kings was boundless like the universe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a qualitative difference in these two energies, and it could be said to be like the difference between the heavens and the earth. They couldn’t be compared at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he carefully sensed the changes in the strength within his entire body, Chen Xi finally had a deep understanding of why Half-step Immortal Kings were able to crush all Saint Immortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because if energy was divided into levels, then the energy possessed by Half-step Immortal Kings had already touched the paramount height of the three dimensions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The changes in his Immortal Force was merely one of the benefits he obtained after advancing into the Half-step Immortal King Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides that, the world within Chen Xi’s body had expanded. It seemed to encompass an entire universe, whereas, his internal organs, veins, and meridians were like the stars and constellations within the universe…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His blood, vital essence, soul, and the supreme Laws of time, space, and life and death had instead become a quintessence energy that maintained the operation of the universe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A universe had formed within his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the most prominent characteristic of a Half-step Immortal King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Half-step Immortal Kings merely possessed a universe that was forming, and when the universe within the body was complete, it would be the sign of advancing into the Immortal King Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, even though the Half-step Immortal King Realm and Immortal King Realm seemed like only half step away, yet there was still a gap that was practically like a natural chasm between them. If one intended to surmount this chasm, then one had to fight for supremacy with the heavens and seize a strand of great karmic luck to attain success!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As it was said, it was impossible to become an Immortal King without karmic luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Chen Xi had just advanced into the Half-step Immortal King Realm, so no matter how extraordinary his natural talent was, it was utterly impossible for him to touch the threshold of the Immortal King Realm in a short period of time without heaven defying karmic luck and accumulation through time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even then, Chen Xi was extremely satisfied in being able to advance to the Half-step Immortal King Realm after spending a short period of seventy years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Chen Xi was sensing the changes in his body, Hua Jiankong flipped his palm and withdrew an Immortal Sword of simple and ancient make. The body of the sword was pitch black and lusterless, and it had a characteristic of returning to simplicity. Shockingly, it was Chen Xi’s Talisman Armament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now that you’ve already advanced into the Half-step Immortal King Realm, there’s no need for me to keep this treasure for you any longer.” Hua Jiankong casually passed the Talisman Armament to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Senior.” A wisp of happiness flashed in Chen Xi’s eyes. He took the Talisman Armament in his hand and stroked it gently. This treasure had accompanied him to battle through the Mortal Dimension, experience slaughters and drink the blood of his enemies. It had long since become a part of Chen Xi’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that this treasure had returned into his possession, Chen Xi was naturally extremely happy and joyful in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This sword’s might is only comparable to a Cosmic Grade Immortal Artifact, so if you intend to utilize it, then you probably have to refine it once more.” Hua Jiankong reminded from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded. He’d accumulated numerous treasures of the heavens and the earth since a long time ago, and it was for the sake of fully refining the Talisman Armament once day when he reclaimed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially the tiny sword he’d obtained from within the Azurelotus Immortal Sword, it would absolutely bring about unbelievable effects when utilized to refine the Talisman Armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, an expanse of space in the vicinity suddenly fluctuated, and then a passageway unfolded within space until it arrived before Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Jiankong instantly came to an understanding when he saw this, and he said, “Chen Xi, the Dean requests your presence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned. “The Dean wants to see me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of excitement couldn’t help but surge into his heart. Because that was the current Dean Meng Xinghe!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was an extraordinary figure of legends!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A long time ago when he obtained the Dao Emperor’s inheritance, &nbsp;he’d started looking forward to being able to meet the Dean, Meng Xinghe. Especially when he found out that Ji Yu was the Dao Emperor, he’d taken the Dean, Meng Xinghe, to be someone close.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, when he found out that he was about to be able to meet the Dean, Meng Xinghe, how could Chen Xi not be excited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chen Xi still had a slight bit of bewilderment in his heart. Because Hua Jiankong had once told him that Meng Xinghe would only meet him after he’d completely grasped the Dao Emperor’s inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why would Meng Xinghe suddenly meet me in advance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, because of the River Diagram fragments, he’d still not grasped the Dao Emperor’s inheritance until now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Presently, the aura of the Five Signs of Death has descended, and it’s a sign that the upheaval of the three dimensions is about to begin. So the Dean had no choice but to change his mind. Quickly go over, don’t make the Dean wait.” Hua Jiankong explained in a casual manner and urged Chen Xi to make a move quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aura of the Five Signs of Death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s heart jerked, and he carried numerous questions in his heart as he stepped foot on that passageway before his entire figure suddenly vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Jiankong didn’t stay here any longer when he saw this, and he returned to Sword Sharpening Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Xuanyuan Xiu, has come to pay a visit to Senior Hua Jiankong.” Right at that very afternoon when Hua Jiankong returned to Sword Sharpening Peak, a young woman in a green dress stood outside Sword Sharpening Peak with an anxious expression between her brows. It was A’Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you need something?” Hua Jiankong always had a rather warm expression before Chen Xi, yet when he was before others, he recovered his aloof and indifferent expression. Even if it was A’Xiu, she was unable to enjoy his special treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, A’Xiu frequently came to send over some jade slips in the recent years, and they recorded some information about the Zuoqiu Clan’s actions that were extremely useful to Chen Xi. So Hua Jiankong had never refused to meet A’Xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, with A’Xiu’s ability, it would be impossible for her to step foot on Sword Sharpening Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, Junior wants to meet Chen Xi. Presently, a major incident has occurred within the Zuoqiu Clan, and the later Chen Xi finds out about, the worse the situation will be for him!” A’Xiu spoke swiftly with a rare solemn expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of shocking cold lightning flashed abruptly within Hua Jiankong’s eyes. “The internal strife of the Zuoqiu Clan wouldn’t have erupted completely, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A’Xiu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the recent years, Hua Jiankong had already obtained an understanding of the enmity between Chen Xi and the Zuoqiu Clan, and he was extremely aware of what the news A’Xiu brought over this time meant. After he obtained A’Xiu’s confirmation, he instantly understood that the situation was so severe that it couldn’t wait any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come with me.” Hua Jiankong went straight to the point and took A’Xiu along as he flashed away from Sword Sharpening Peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an extremely vast Secret Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Green pine trees, waterfalls, violet bamboos, clear springs, ancient rocks… They were scattered all over the Secret Realm like stars in the sky, and it was simple and tranquil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Chen Xi sat cross-legged on a low rock, and his expression was slightly dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Junior Brother!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the greeting he heard when he entered the Secret Realm, and the person who greeted him was none other than the current Dean, Meng Xinghe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned because of this greeting, ‘Junior Brother!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he met Ji Yu in the Mortal Dimension, he’d long since guessed that at the bottom of it all, the reason his Senior Sister Li Yang had arranged for him to enter Dao Emperor Academy was because of Ji Yu. Because Ji Yu was the Dao Emperor that established this number one academy in the Immortal Dimension by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely because of this knowledge that he finally understood why no seniors of the academy dared to take him as their disciple after he entered the academy while being the first in the recruitment test. Because strictly speaking, he was the Martial Nephew of the Dao Emperor! So, would anyone have the qualifications to take him as their disciple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also finally clearly aware of why the Dean took his Talisman Armament away. Because the Dean was worried that he would expose his identity. In other words, Meng Xinghe had definitely guessed his identity, so Meng Xinghe acted in this way entirely with the intention of looking after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chen Xi had never imagined that he would actually become the Dean’s Junior Brother!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If news of this were to spread, it would probably cause everyone in the Immortal Dimension to go mad, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, when Chen Xi calmed down and thought about it, this outcome was within reason. Because Meng Xinghe was able to succeed the position of Dean in Dao Emperor Academy, so he’d definitely obtained the Dao Emperor’s inheritance in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the Dao Emperor’s inheritance had been left behind by Ji Yu. In other words, Meng Xinghe was one of Ji Yu’s disciples. In this way, it was extremely normal for Meng Xinghe to address Chen Xi as Junior Brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Meng Xinghe was similarly sitting cross-legged in a casual manner on a rock before Chen Xi, and his deep eyes that were filled with the aura of experience carried a smiling expression as he looked at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw Chen Xi’s expression recover its calm, he said, “I called you over here this time for two reasons. The first is to allow you to understand the relationship between us, and the second is to confirm something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was slightly stunned, and he hurriedly said, “Senior, please go ahead.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Xinghe teased. “You’re still calling me Senior? Could it be that you don’t intend to admit that I’m your Senior Brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but be slightly embarrassed, and he said, “Senior Brother, don’t take it to heart. I just haven’t gotten used to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s normal. Even though I’ve been paying attention to you at all times in the recent years, I’ve never met you directly. You’ll get used to it in the future.” Meng Xinghe smiled before his expression became solemn, and he said in a serious manner, “Did you meet my Master when you returned to the Mortal Dimension?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded, and then he sighed lightly. “I did. Unfortunately, he didn’t return with me, and he left by himself…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he spoke about all the information he knew. He did this because he didn’t doubt Meng Xinghe’s identity at all, so he naturally wouldn’t treat Meng Xinghe like an outsider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I knew this day would come.” Meng Xinghe went silent for a long time after he heard all of this from Chen Xi, and then he sighed with emotion. A wisp of sadness couldn’t be hidden on his face, and his thoughts at this moment were a mystery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was rather regretful in his heart as well because he couldn’t bear to see Ji Yu leave as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, Hua Jiankong’s voice suddenly resounded within the Secret Realm. “Master, Disciple has an urgent matter tell you.”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Xinghe frowned, and then he flicked his sleeve. In the next moment, Hua Jiankong’s figure appeared within the Secret Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s so urgent?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Jiankong cupped his fists and said, “Master, this matter is related to Chen Xi. Presently, the internal strife within the Zuoqiu Clan has erupted completely, and the situation is urgent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What!?” Chen Xi’s expression turned grim as he suddenly stood up, and he asked urgently. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know the exact situation. That little girl from the Xuanyuan Clan is waiting for you outside the Secret Realm. You…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Hua Jiankong could finish speaking, Chen Xi had already charged out impatiently from the Secret Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
