 <p>Chapter 241 – Fierce Beast Suanni</p>
 <p>Nine ancient talisman characters that glowed with a brilliant golden luster appeared on the surface of the Dao Measuring Stone, and it was ordered from top to bottom to represent the names of the top nine in the second test.</p>
 <p>What shocked everyone was that it wasn’t Zhen Liuqing at the spot of the first, but it was instead the name of the latecomer, Chen Xi!</p>
 <p>Only Zhen Liuqing herself knew what was going on. Even though she possessed 16 Dao Insights as well, but only three amongst these 16 were Grand Daos, and it was far from being capable of going against the seven Grand Daos Chen Xi possessed.</p>
 <p>When the amount was equal, then it would be a competition of quality.</p>
 <p>These were only the seven Grand Daos Chen Xi revealed that was known to all, whereas, whether the other nine were Grand Daos or Minor Daos had become a mystery instead.</p>
 <p>But no matter what, it was an indisputable truth that Chen Xi had leaped up to become first now, and no one was capable of wiping out this result.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi, who stood at the back of the crowd, didn’t feel much delight in his heart when he saw his own name ranked at the top. The outstanding usually bore the brunt of any attack, especially when obtaining the first rank under the circumstances of possessing a strength that’s incapable of suppressing everyone present, it was even easier to draw a great deal of unwanted trouble.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was the first, Zhen Liuqing the second, and the cultivators that were ranked at the third to ninth were respectively Huangfu Chongming, Yue Qi, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, and Xiao Linger.</p>
 <p>Lin Moxuan and Pei Zhong that were ranked in the top nine had been pushed out of the rankings because of the appearance of Yue Qi and Chen Xi. In other words, both of them had already lost the qualifications to obtain the Dao Insight Origin Pill now.</p>
 <p>One was the Golden Core Realm Core Disciple of the Earthly Heaven Sect, the other from the Whitecrane Sect, yet both, who were firmly in the top nine, had been surpassed by latecomers and pushed off the rankings. The great rise and fall of their rankings caused the two almost spit blood from depression.</p>
 <p>The surrounding people wrung their wrists in sorrow and sighed endlessly for the two when they saw this scene. This feeling of gaining before loss was indeed capable of torturing one to madness.</p>
 <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, nine multicolored lights that emitter monstrous might tore through the sky as they swiftly appeared within the hall, and they were like nine divine dragons descending into the world that emitted a terrifying aura.</p>
 <p>The multicolored light flashed to appear above Chen Xi and the others that were ranked in the top nine before transforming into a fist size medicinal pill that was completely translucent and crystalline, and it revolved ceaselessly while floating above them.</p>
 <p>This medicinal pill possessed numerous mysterious and unfathomable Dao markings on its surface, and there were even numerous hair-like gold colored chains that interweaved together to form a profound and complicated pattern. This pattern was like an inviolable god that suppressed the surroundings of the medicinal pill and emitted the energy of the laws that was unique to Heavenly Immortals.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi noticed with a glance that the golden chains on the surroundings of the medicinal pill were the energy of the laws that a Heavenly Immortal possessed, and it seemed to be material. Being capable of extracting Dao Insight and confining it within a medicinal pill was a truly superb skill that excelled fortune itself.</p>
 <p>Obviously, these nine medicinal pills were Dao Insight Origin Pills, the miraculous medicinal pills of legend that allowed one to instantly comprehend a type of Dao Insight after consuming it!</p>
 <p>In the current cultivation world, the appearance of every single Dao Insight Origin Pill in the world would draw great bloodshed, and it could be said to be an extremely precious priceless treasure that everyone dreamed of.</p>
 <p>The reason it was so was due to Dao Insight Origin Pills being too scarce, and its effects too heaven defying.</p>
 <p>This type of medicinal pill could only be refined by extremely formidable Heavenly Immortals that extracted the Dao Insights they’d comprehended to seal it within the medicinal pill, whereas, every single Dao Insight could only be refined into a single medicinal pill. Moreover, it required the consumption of a strand of the Heavenly Immortal’s Blood Essence, causing the Heavenly Immortal to be injured greatly.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of this that unless it was under special circumstances, then there wasn’t a single Heavenly Immortal that was willing to refine a Dao Insight Origin Pill with his own Dao Insights and Blood Essence.</p>
 <p>“These nine Dao Insight Origin Pills respectively represent the three Grand Daos and six Minor Daos I possessed when ascending to become a Heavenly Immortal. Kindly accept these rewards.” Right when the nine Dao Insight Origin Pills appeared, the aged and sonorous voice sounded out in an unhurried manner, and it reverberated within the hall for a long time before dying out.</p>
 <p>“Three Grand Daos and six Minor Daos? Looks like only the top three are able to obtain a Dao Insight Origin Pill that possesses a Grand Dao. The other six are instead only capable of obtaining one that contains a Minor Dao.” Everyone instantly came to an understanding, and the gazes they shot at Chen Xi, Zhen Liuqing, and Huangfu Chongming revealed envy and curiosity. They wanted to find out exactly what Grand Dao was contained within those three Dao Insight Origin Pills.</p>
 <p>However, to their regret, no matter if it was Chen Xi’s group of three, or the other six people, all of them carefully withdrew a jade box before placing the Dao Insight Origin Pill into the jade box, and they didn’t directly swallow it. This caused the others to be unable to discern exactly what Dao Insight was contained within the nine Dao Insight Origin Pills.</p>
 <p>After he put away the Dao Insight Origin Pill, a strand of a strange feeling appeared in Chen Xi’s heart, because at the moment he put away the pill earlier, he clearly noticed that the Dao Insight contained within the pill was actually the Grand Dao of Earth…</p>
 <p><i>Heavens, are you playing with me?! </i>Even with Chen Xi’s composure, he couldn’t help but feel a wave of speechlessness and almost wasn’t able to refrain from bursting out with insults. He’d long since mastered the Grand Dao of Earth in his heart, and in other words, this Dao Insight Origin Pill was utterly useless to him!</p>
 <p><i>I’m ranked as the first yet obtained a useless thing, and I’ve instead become the target of everyone, causing my situation to be rather worrisome. I wonder if the owner of this treasure vault intentionally did this, or was it an unintentional action? </i>Chen Xi sighed endlessly within his heart. Under these circumstances, he could only accept this outcome.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the Dao Insight Origin Pill wasn’t consumed and he could give it away to someone like Ling Bai or Chen Hao.</p>
 <p><i>But the amount of Dao Insights can’t decide one’s combat strength. It only represents one’s knowledge towards the Heaven’s Dao, and it still requires diligent and bitter cultivation to transform it into one’s own strength. Moreover, comprehension of the Dao isn’t difficult to me, so I don’t have to be too depressed. </i>Chen Xi weighed and considered endlessly within his mind.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>The hall suddenly started to shake intensely as if the heavens were collapsing and the earth shattering. The originally beautifully decorated walls in the surroundings collapsed with a bang before everyone felt their vision go black. In the next moment, everyone had arrived in an empty wilderness.</p>
 <p>This wilderness was boundlessly vast with a cluster of stars hanging high in the sky, the ground was covered in grass, yet without a gust of wind blowing by, and there wasn’t the slightest aura of living beings, causing it to seem cold and desolate to the extreme.</p>
 <p>Everyone that instantly appeared here from the hall felt a wave of anxiousness and unease, and they heaved a sigh of relief after they surveyed the surroundings and noticed that it was devoid of danger.</p>
 <p>“There’s a peerlessly precious treasure left behind by me in the third test, and it’s guarded by the soul of a divine beast Suanni. Those with inferior strengths must not head forward, otherwise, don’t blame me for not warning you when you perish.” &nbsp;&nbsp;The aged and sonorous resounded once more within the vast wilderness. “Jade is given to those with true reputation, just like treasures are given to those who are fated. If 15 minutes pass yet no one has the fortune of obtaining the treasure, then this hall will fall into eternal silence, whereas, all of you will be transported to the outside world. I hope that all of you can make the best use of your time. If you’re able to obtain this treasure, then you have fate with my Sky Dao Palace, and I’ll have no more regrets, alas.”</p>
 <p><i>Peerlessly precious treasure?</i></p>
 <p>A mere four words revealed irresistible temptation, causing everyone to instantly go into an uproar. All of them were excited, to the point of being hardly capable of restraining themselves, and their gazes revealed vicious expressions as they swept the surroundings as if they were warning the others to not compete with them for it.</p>
 <p>“Roar!” A ferocious roar sounded out from extremely far away in the horizon. It penetrated through iron and split rocks, caused the wild grass to rustle and tremble, and the entire heavens and the earth started to tremble. Along with the roar, an enormous fierce beast that possessed the form of a human appeared on the horizon, it was 300m tall like a mountain, and golden fur on its body glowed brilliantly. Every single inch of its fur seemed to contain countless mysterious and flickering Dao markings, its eyes seemed like two blood moons, and it possessed a monstrous ferocious aura.</p>
 <p>The instant this beast appeared, it was like an unparalleled devil king descending into the world as it roared at the sky. Its roiling ferocious and baleful aura caused the wilderness to be deathly silent, and even the spirit energy of the heavens and the earth fled in all directions with a bang before wailing and going into dormancy.</p>
 <p>Everyone felt suffocated as boundless tempestuous waves emerged abruptly within their hearts.</p>
 <p>Suanni!</p>
 <p>The terrifying fierce beast that possessed monstrous might during the primordial era!</p>
 <p>Even though they clearly knew that the fierce beast in the extreme distance was only a strand of a Suanni’s soul, yet the ferocious aura emitted from its entire body wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to an Earthly Immortal Realm expert. Just it standing there from afar caused everyone to feel it was unshakeable, and gave birth to feelings of being tiny and insignificant in their hearts.</p>
 <p>Behind the enormous body of the Suanni was a 300m tall jade platform that seemed like the high platform built by the predecessors of the primordial era built to offer sacrifices to the gods and ancestors. The entire platform emitted a misty azure glow, and the azure glow had condensed into a sun at the top of the platform. The sun emitted a brilliance that illuminated the world, and it seemed as if a precious treasure of the heavens and the earth were being developed there.</p>
 <p>Everyone didn’t have to guess, it was surely the peerlessly precious treasure the owner of the treasure vault spoke about.</p>
 <p>“Roar!” Right at this moment, the Suanni roared once more with a ferocious might that shot into the sky before its pair of eyes that seemed like blood moons shot over towards them, and its gaze was like a blood colored bolt of lightning as it tore through the sky and descended onto them. Everyone felt their entire bodies go cold from being stared at by it, and unrestrainable terror emerged from the depths of their hearts.</p>
 <p>Great terror!</p>
 <p>The highest cultivation amongst all of them was only at the perfection-stage of the Golden Core Realm, thus when faced with a primordial fierce beast that possessed a cultivation that surpassed them by two realms, they didn’t have the slightest confidence in their hearts.</p>
 <p>They deeply understood that compared to the two tests from before, this was the true test of life and death!</p>
 <p>“That Suanni is standing at the side of the high platform without moving an inch away. We’re like ants that lack the slightest chance of success when facing it, so how can we obtain the peerlessly precious treasure?” Someone wailed with an unsightly expression.</p>
 <p>“This Suanni is only a strand of soul, and it’s comparable to an Earthly Immortal Realm expert in strength. It’s like a natural chasm that’s impossible to surmount to us. But I won’t give up just like this, as returning empty handed isn’t my style. No matter what, I have to try!” Some others still braced themselves and persisted.</p>
 <p>“Exactly. Life and death are bound by fate, and fortune comes from danger. How do we know the Suanni isn’t putting on airs if we don’t give it a try? Perhaps this might only be a test of courage set by the owner of the treasure vault?” The eyes of someone flickered as he pondered deeply before speaking.</p>
 <p>No matter how these people discussed animatedly, Huangfu Chongming and the others glanced at each other instead and understood what each other was thinking, and then they imperceptibly walked over towards Chen Xi from all directions.</p>
 <p>Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, and Xiao Linger came from the east. Liu Fengchi and the three Dragonshark Isle disciples behind him came from the west. Man Hong and his two Junior Brothers came from the north. Pei Zhong and Xue Chen, the two Whitecrane Sect disciples came from the south. All of them arrived behind Chen Xi in unison and formed a semi-circular fan shape that surrounded Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>They only left a forward path to Chen Xi, moreover, this forward path was facing the primordial fierce beast, Suanni.</p>
 <p>It was self-evident, these people wanted to follow closely behind Chen Xi so that they could seize his treasures once he died, and if he didn’t die, they could force him to his death!</p>
 <p>All in all, in the hearts of Huangfu Chongming and the others, the treasures in Chen Xi’s possession were even similarly important to the peerlessly precious treasure guarded by the Suanni. They were absolutely unwilling to miss an opportunity like this to annihilate Chen Xi and seize his treasure.</p>
 <p>The attention of the people present was drawn by the extremely distant Suanni and the 300m tall high platform behind it, and there were actually only a few people that noticed Chen Xi’s situation had undergone a tremendous change.</p>
 <p>These few people included Zhen Liuqing, An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, Yue Qi, and a few more people.</p>
 <p>When they saw Chen Xi being surrounded, they each had a different expression, yet out of the consideration that Huangfu Chongming and the others were great in number, no one dared interfere.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi instead seemed as if he’d expected this scene since long ago, and his expression was calm as he remained silent.</p>
 <p>He’d already noticed that the shapeless restriction still existed during this third test. Huangfu Chongming and the others could only make a move against the Suanni, yet were utterly unable to make a move against him, causing the restriction to seem extremely miraculous, and he couldn’t help but praise. <i>The owner of the treasure vault’s utilization of restrictions has probably attained an unbelievable height.</i></p>
 <p>It was precisely because of this that he completely paid no attention to the changes in his situation, and he continued to stare fixedly at the Suanni in the extreme distance as an absurd thought arose within his heart. <i>They’re both primordial divine beasts, yet why is Bai Kui born a glutton but the Suanni possesses such monstrous might?</i></p>
