 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Realm cultivator glanced at Chen Xi with slight surprise before flashing onto the combat ring, and then he swept the surroundings with his gaze and said with a deep voice, “Combat ring 16, Chen Xi is victorious!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was sonorous like a bell and resounded out in all directions, causing everyone to seem to have awakened from a dream as they let out long breaths of air, and they still felt a lingering fear in their hearts when they thought about the speed of Chen Xi’s sword from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a swift speed, what a terrifying strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His movement technique is illusory like the wind, and it obviously contains the Wind Dao Insight and Sky Dao Insight. Amazing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When did such an expert appear in the southern territory? The cultivators from the southern territory were all eliminated in the first round of the previous Goldlake Meetings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While everyone was discussing animatedly, Chen Xi hesitate for a long time, yet didn’t know where to go, and he could only helplessly sit back at the seat that caused the surrounding people to feel envious of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Amazing! You defeated an advanced-stage Golden Core Realm cultivator with a single strike. You really concealed your strength so deeply.” Sure enough, Chen Xi had just returned to his seat when Ya Qing had already spoke with a grin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I’m not wrong, you seem to have not exerted your full strength earlier.” On the other side, Zhen Liuqing spoke as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve indeed not exerted my full strength.” Chen Xi nodded. He didn’t just not exert his full strength, he hadn’t even exerted 30% of his strength. Unfortunately, Qiu Yan’s strength was too weak. When he thought up to here, Chen Xi rubbed his chin and asked. “Did I go slightly too far earlier? Actually, I could have allowed him to not exit so embarrassingly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of the young women were stunned, and then Ya Qing burst into laughter, and she smiled beautifully like a flower as she chided. “You look to be serious, yet never had I imagined that you’re so sarcastic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing couldn’t help but chuckle as well, yet she felt even more curious in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly what percent of his strength had this fellow exerted earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were 60,000 cultivators participating in the Goldlake Meeting this time, and the first round of the competition would eliminate half the people. Only those that were victorious had the qualifications to participate in the second round of the competition that was by way of challenging opponents. Moreover, this competition was the true main event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But due to the number of cultivators participating being too many, the first round of the competition was carried out for an entire three days before ending. During these three days of time, there were countless battles that played out on the 18 combat rings, but most of them were nothing special, and truly interesting battles were scarce to a pitiable degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was because the difference in strength of the participants was truly too huge. Even though all of them were at the Golden Core Realm, there was the gap between the initial-stage, intermediate-stage, advanced-stage, and perfection-stage. Even if the cultivators were of the same cultivation, there was a difference in their combat strength, and most of the cultivators were defeated by their opponents in a mere few moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some that were even more extreme. For example, Young Master Zhou, An Qianyu, and Wang Daoxu’s opponents didn’t even ascend the combat rings before voluntarily admitting defeat, causing the spectators that wanted to view the scene of these top experts in battle to feel a wave of disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi wasn’t idle during these three days either, and he accompanied the two incomprehensible young women to watch the battles in these three days, and probably only he himself knew how it felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something worthy of mention was that besides Chen Xi, all the other cultivators of the southern territory that had participated in the Goldlake Meeting this time had been eliminated, and this outcome caused Chen Xi to be unable to help but feel speechless and slightly uncomfortable in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the southern territory, Pine Mist City was his hometown. In the central plains, the southern territory was his hometown. So Chen Xi naturally felt unhappy in his heart when he saw the cultivators of his hometown losing successively, and this was human nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention that during the current Goldlake Meeting, everyone else would only take him to be a cultivator of the southern territory, and they wouldn’t distinguish the southern territory’s Pine Mist City in detail. In other words, amongst the cultivators that had entered the second round of the competition, Chen Xi had become the one and only cultivator from the southern territory. How weak the southern territory was amongst the other areas of the entire Darchu Dynasty was obvious from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the fourth day of the Goldlake Meeting, the second round of the competition would finally start!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, a dense crowd of people already filled the venue, and the number of people was at least 20% more than before, causing the scene to be extremely bustling and unprecedentedly grand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The way I see it, only the Zhou Clan’s Fourth Young Master is capable of obtaining 100 successive victories, and no matter how formidable the others are, it’s difficult to be sure that they wouldn’t be defeated by experts of the same cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! What do you know? There are numerous experts in the Goldlake Meeting this time, like the Skysplit Sword Sect’s An Qianyu, the Brightray Sect’s Wang Daoxu, and the Warlord’s Estate’s disciple Su Chan. All of them are extremely formidable figures that aren’t inferior to Young Master Zhou. In my opinion, all of them could possibly obtain 100 successive victories.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot! These people have already become renowned in the world since long ago, and it isn’t unusual even if they win. I noticed numerous new faces that aren’t inferior to these people in terms of strength, and it’s just that their reputation isn’t known.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, then tell us who exactly are these people?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The northern barbaric lands’ Zenith Sect’s Ji Yue, the eastern sea’s Jadepool Celestial Isle’s Hua Mobei, and the southern territory’s Chen Xi. The reputation of these three people wasn’t illustrious in the past, yet they revealed extremely shocking combat strengths in the first round of the competition, and they can’t be underestimated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ji Yue and Hua Mobei you spoke of are extraordinary indeed. They both possess cultivations at the perfection-stage of the Golden Core Realm, and their strengths are extremely formidable as well. But I don’t look favorably on Chen Xi. His speed is exceedingly swift indeed, and it’s more than enough when dealing with ordinary people, yet before absolute strength, merely possessing speed will utterly not do. Not to mention his cultivation is an obvious weak point. So how could he possibly compare with the other experts?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t speak without leaving any room for other possibilities. Perhaps Chen Xi still has some trump card he hasn’t revealed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trump card? Others have trump cards as well. These are utterly two different things!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Voices were like waves in the entire venue of the Goldlake Meeting, and all of them were discussing in unison about the competition that was about to begin. Moreover, the people that were discussed the most were undoubtedly Young Master Zhou, An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, Su Chan, and a few others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these people were from illustrious ancient sects. They possessed extraordinary talent, deep cultivations, and had already become renowned in the world since long ago. So, they’d become the hottest candidates for obtaining 100 successive victories in the Goldlake Meeting this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Chen Xi, besides his shocking speed that caused everyone to have a deep impression of him, he didn’t have anything else that drew the attention of others, so the level of attention paid to him became comparatively lower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t care about all this. He’s participated in the Goldlake Meeting only because he wanted to measure where his limit was after advancing to the Golden Core Realm. &nbsp;As for the amount of attention paid to him, reputation, and rewards, he didn’t really care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he still took it seriously as he ought to. It wasn’t such an easy matter to obtain successive victories in the competition. As the more battles one participated in, the more clearly others would understand one’s moves and strength, whereas one didn’t know what formidable moves one’s opponent possessed. Besides that, after undergoing prolonged battle, one would surely lose the drive one had in the beginning and start to feel exhausted in mind and body as well. At this moment, if an expert with a similar cultivation made an appearance, the opponent would be able to end one’s successive victory streak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, along with one’s streak of successive victories going higher, the stronger the experts that challenged one later on would be. No one was an idiot, so since they dared ascend the combat ring to issue a challenge, they surely possessed extremely great confidence towards their strength, or perhaps they’d long since understood one’s abilities completely. So, if one wanted to obtain 100 successive victories, it wasn’t as easy as one would imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dang! Dang! Dang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wave of clear and melodious sounds of a bell resounded out in the heavens and the earth, causing the clamorous noise in the surroundings to instantly vanish without a trace, and the gazes of everyone shot towards the 18 combat rings in unison. They knew that the second round of the Goldlake Meeting had begun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m the central plains’ Watercave Mountain’s Wu Ming, I’ll silently wait for the instructions of Fellow Daoists!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could such a grand event not have I, Liao Mubai in it? I’ll seize the first in this round of the competition as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The northern barbaric lands’ Bullbeetle Sect’s Lu Da!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when the sounds of the balls had just resounded out, over 10 figures had already charged up the 18 combat rings, and all them were in high spirits and revealed formidable strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These fellows are smart. They know that the true experts won’t ascend the rings when the competition has just begun, so if their strengths aren’t bad, they can seize this opportunity to successively win a few battles.” Ya Qing lightly smiled beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But they’ll only lose in the end. There’re only 18 combat rings, and if one’s strength is insufficient, one would be unable to occupy a combat ring for a long period of time.” Zhen Liuqing spoke unhurriedly as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi pondered slightly before quickly coming to an understanding, and he couldn’t help but shake his head. It was just as Zhen Liuqing had said, it was utterly impossible if one wanted to occupy a combat ring until one attained 100 successive victories without absolute strength. After all, this competition only tested a single thing: strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he knew as well that the goal of most of the participants was the generous rewards, and not for the honor of 100 successive victories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, one would be able to win 100,000 Nascent Condensation Pills from obtaining 10 successive victories, 200,000 Nascent Condensation Pills from obtaining 20 successive victories, and so on and so forth. One only had to win a few rounds and a few hundreds of thousands of Nascent Condensation Pills would be obtained. So what if they stopped before obtaining 100 successive victories in the end?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, the greater the benefit, the greater the motivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, in the following battles, the experts like Young Master Zhou didn’t ascend the ring, and they seemed as if they were waiting for a superb opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the combat rings temporarily lacked the figures of these experts, the battles were obviously much more interesting when compared with the first round of the competition from a few days ago, and it drew waves of sharp cries of shock, causing the atmosphere to be bustling.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t make a move either. He sat in the spectating area as he watched the battles on the various combat rings with great interest, and he obtained slight gains while greatly widening his horizons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These cultivators were top figures in the younger generation that had come from all over the Darchu Dynasty, and the Magic Treasures, Dao Grade martial techniques, and combat skills simply encompassed everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that Chen Xi even saw an extremely peculiar cultivator that had storage Magic Treasures hanging all over his body. It wasn’t just a variety of talismans that were stored within, but there were also medicinal pills that replenished one’s physical strength, combat puppets with formidable strength, etc. Even though this cultivator’s own combat strength was mediocre, yet he utilized other objects to the extreme and obtained repeated victories, causing the spectating cultivators to be dumbstruck and cry out that his battle technique was unaffordable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a female cultivator that was skilled in taming beasts and controlled a few hundreds or thousands of spirit butterflies to fight. These spirit butterflies were of a variety of colors, and seemed to be frail, yet each of them possessed a formidable technique like confusing one’s mind, sound wave attacks, spraying poison mists, etc. Under the control of this female cultivator, they exploded out with terrifying lethality, allowing her to repeatedly obtain victories and cause the surrounding people the exclaim with admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But most striking of them all was a barefooted body refiner that wore linen clothes. His skin was dark, the muscles on his entire body were defined, angular, and were suffused with a jade like sheen, and his bald head revealed a striking tattooed pattern of a red lotus flower, causing his solemn disposition to carry a trace of a peculiar aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His battle style was straightforward and peerlessly powerful, allowing him to repeatedly fight over 20 battles, yet not a single person could withstand a single move. Moreover, he seemed to still have strength to spare, causing him to seem extremely at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, vital energy and blood that surged like boiling lava effused out from his body while he fought and caused a blood colored cloud that covered an area of 300m to arise above him. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the blood colored cloud as various mysterious runes surged within it, causing it to be extremely striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was a perfection-stage Golden Core Realm body refinement expert from the northern barbaric lands, the Zenith Sect’s Ji Yue! &nbsp;</span></p>
