They looked over along with his gaze yet didn’t see anything, and they couldn’t help but be bewildered.</span></p>

But they’d just exited the Book Reserve Pavilion and hadn’t noticed anything unusual, so they hesitated briefly before resolutely turning around to return into the Book Reserve Pavilion.</span></p>

Ordinarily, he was always laying on the rocking chair while dozing with narrowed eyes, and it was always the same every single day, causing him to be like a living stone that was completely silent. They’d long since been accustomed to the old man being like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now he’d actually suddenly stood up, and this scene was simply too unusual, so they couldn’t help but be curious.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly what happened within the Book Reserve Pavilion that drew the old man’s attention?</span></p>

Under these circumstances, Chen Xi seemed as if he was walking on even ground, and he’d walked into the depths of the Domain of Wind in an extremely short period of a few breaths of time before ascending the ninth layer of the lotus platform!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was the Domain of Lightning.</span></p>

At the center of the flat platform was the beam of light that was connected with the sky and emitted a myriad of rays of light that Chen Xi had seen when he’d just arrived at the peak of the mountain of books!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, violent Lightning Dao Insight filled the Domain of Lightning, and they developed into numerous ancient symbols that represented lightning. There were surging seas of lightning, raging thunderstorms, and numerous divine beasts that were born from lightning here, and everywhere that met the eye, the entire heavens and the earth were enveloped in an expanse of a dazzling and resplendent glow of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, amidst this world that was filled with boundless Lightning Dao Insight was a graceful and beautiful figure sitting cross-legged there. Her jet black hair was dense like a waterfall that flowed down her shoulders, and it drew out graceful lines of her back, whereas her slender waist revealed shocking allure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was unable to see her appearance clearly because she had her back towards him, but Chen Xi felt his breath taken away just from looking at this figure from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That gorgeous hair that was like a waterfall that was suffused with a misty sheen and that slender and graceful outline of her back seemed as if they were carved and polished meticulously by the heavens. She was gorgeous, exuberant, and revealed an indescribable aura of allure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was a cultivator with insufficient composure that saw this scene, the cultivator would probably have his soul entranced on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was slightly dazed as well before returning to his senses, and he couldn’t help but exclaim with admiration in his heart. He’d never imagined in the past that merely the sight of someone’s back would be able to take his breath away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman is probably the number one Elite Disciple of the South Radiance Peak, An Wei…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi seemed to have thought of something, and then he shook his head before moving forward.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, comparatively speaking, Chen Xi’s composure could already be considered to be outstanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the way during his path of cultivation until now, he’d encountered countless young women that were as gorgeous as celestial maidens, and most of them had deep relationships with him. It was even to the extent that he was very sure that so long as he took the initiative to open up his heart, he would probably already possess a family now like his younger brother, Chen Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But regretfully, he didn’t do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, when the responsibility one carried on one’s shoulder was greater than everything, it would cause one to have no choice but to give up the fetters of personal emotions because only in this way would one be able to be at ease while traversing one’s path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was just like this. There were truly too many things that he carried on his shoulders. So while he was still in a state of wandering about and without a definite residence, he didn’t hope that the person he loved would lead a wandering life with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</span></p>

Now, there was actually someone that had stepped into it once more, so how could it not arouse shock in their hearts!?</span></p>

He was able to clearly sense the Dao Insight pressure around his body that had suddenly become terrifying.
