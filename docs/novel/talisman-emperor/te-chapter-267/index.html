He’d shouldered the heavy responsibility of his family since a young age. These years of bitter and diligent cultivating and the great efforts he put into survival, all of this was for the sake of rebuilding the Chen Clan and allowing the clan to regain its former glory so that his grandfather that had passed away could smile in the netherworld.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that Wei Yuezi’s threat had undoubtedly touched Chen Xi’s reverse scale and had completely ignited the killing intent in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can give you a chance. So long as you destroy your own Dao Foundation and hand over the Grand Qi Atomic Sword Formation respectfully to me, I can excuse your Chen Clan from death. How about it?” &nbsp;Wei Yuezi spoke slowly. He’d noticed Chen Xi’s killing intent, yet completely didn’t take it seriously.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What can a fellow at the Half-step Golden Core Realm do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he was a Golden Core Realm disciple of the Five Element Sect, and he himself possessed a cultivation at the perfection-stage of the Golden Core Realm. The seniors in his sect looked favorably upon him and felt that he would surely have a place in the Allstar Meeting two years from now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Destroy his own Dao Foundation? Eldest Senior Brother, aren’t you letting him off too lightly? Senior Brother Meng was careless and was taken by surprise by him. Currently, Senior Brother Meng is still unconscious, so, he must use his lowly life to atone for his crimes!” Lin Qiuling’s beautiful face sneered repeatedly, and the gaze she looked at Chen Xi with was filled with loathing and detest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So today’s matter can only end in death.” Chen Xi listened indifferently to the conditions put forward by Wei Yuezi and Lin Qiuling, his aura became increasingly calm, tranquil, peaceful, and sedate, and he seemed as if these conditions weren’t related to him. “If you have the courage, then follow me. The Grand Qi Atomic Sword Formation is yours for the taking once you kill me, it only depends on if you have the ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Chen Xi turned around and walked out. The main hall’s space was too small, so once the battle started, it would be extremely easy for the main hall to suffer damage, and he didn’t want to destroy the buildings of the Chen Clan because of this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re so eager to die, how can I not fulfill your wish?” When he saw Chen Xi overconfidently wanting to battle him, Wei Yuezi couldn’t help but start laughing out of extreme anger, and then his figure flashed out of the main hall like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>

Chen Xi and Wei Yuezi didn’t waste any more time talking and arrived at the open practice grounds outside the Chen Clan main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else who sat in the main hall hurried over as well before standing and watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of these two people was a Golden Core Realm disciple at the perfection-stage of the Golden Core Realm from the central plains’ Five Element Sect. He was an extraordinary figure that was cold, proud, and aloof, and his cultivation surpassed everyone present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the other only had a cultivation at the Half-step Golden Core Realm, his fame shook the southern territory. He possessed a formidable strength, had obtained the top rank in the Hidden Dragon Rankings, and he was even sword brothers with the Supreme Elder of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, causing his reputation to be like the sun in the midday sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a true fierce struggle.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half-step Golden Core Realm, looks like Chen Xi only has to overcome the tribulation of wind and fire before being able to condense his golden core and attain the roots of the heavens and the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao stood with a solemn expression outside the practice grounds, yet he didn’t feel the slightest worry in his heart as he looked at Chen Xi and Wei Yuezi. Since he was young, he’d worshipped his older brother blindly, and no matter what Chen Xi did, he’d firmly believe that Chen Xi would surely succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Fei Lengcui walked over with little Chen Yu in her arms. The little fellow’s clear and jet black large eyes were wide open and sparkled as he looked at the distant Chen Xi, and he said in a melodious voice, “Father, is Uncle going to fight?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle isn’t fighting, he’s going to kill someone.” Chen Hao rubbed his son’s head and spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill?” Little Chen Yu was stunned, and then he said excitedly, “I’ve only seen people kill chickens and fish, I’ve never seen someone killing a person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Chen Yu’s excitement caused Chen Hao to be stunned. If it was another child, the child would probably be terrified to tears when the word kill was mentioned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why is this little fellow feeling excited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, good luck!” Little Chen Yu closed his hands together to form the shape of a trumped before shouting out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi seemed to have heard little Chen Yu’s voice, and he looked over and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, you still have the mood to look around at this moment?” An icy cold voice that contained killing intent entered into Chen Xi’s ears, and it was Wei Yuezi who’d spoken. He wore a lunar white Daoist robe with a treasured sword on his back, yet he didn’t unsheathe it, and he instead had his hands behind his back as strands of lightning flashes that seemed like cold lightning suffused his pitch black eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t attack impatiently, yet everyone could sense an enormous force slowly circulating within this person’s body, and the vital energy around his body was like a great river that formed a vortex, causing the spirit energy in the heavens and the earth to slightly seems as if it was about to collapse with him at its center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the manifestations of one’s vital energy conforming to the heavens and the earth. The body was like the roots of the heavens and the earth that conformed with the world and was capable of drawing the energy of the heavens and the earth. With every single move, one was capable of exerting absolute dominance, and this was the aura possessed by a Golden Core Realm expert. With a single thought in one’s heart, one could control the energy of the heavens and the earth to seal all the paths of retreat of one’s enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, Golden Core Realm cultivators are extraordinary… I wonder if Chen Xi is able to deal with him? Since he dares issue a challenge, he surely has something to rely on.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they felt the terrifying aura emitted by Wei Yuezi, everyone present was extremely worried for Chen Xi in their hearts. But when they saw Chen Xi’s body move casually as if he wasn’t the affected in the slightest bit by the collapse of the spirit energy in the heavens and the earth, they instantly felt relieved in their hearts, and they understood that Chen Xi’s strength seemed to not be something any ordinary Golden Hall Realm cultivator could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re far from being a match for me with your cultivation. For the sake of allowing you to die fair and square, I advise you to utilize your most formidable Magic Treasure.” Wei Yuezi seemed to have become a completely different person when facing a battle, his bearing was sedate yet emitted an aura as if he held immeasurable power in his hands, and his gaze was condescending, yet his expression didn’t change in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was understandable as there were no ordinary people amongst cultivators that could attain the Golden Core Realm. At this moment, Wei Yuezi fully revealed the strong confidence and bearing of placing one’s self above all beings that Golden Core Realm cultivators possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I similarly don’t have to use any Magic Treasures when dealing with someone like you, because you’re unworthy.” Chen Xi spoke carefreely in a light voice, and he didn’t reveal the slightest fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m unworthy?” Wei Yuezi was stunned, and then he let out a ghastly and cold smile. “You have a sharp mouth. Then I’ll smash your mouth first and pull out your tongue!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice hadn’t finished reverberating in the air when Wei Yuezi’s figure tore through the sky like a shuttle to assault Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of sharp golden light gushed out from within his palm, and it was suffused with a metallic icy cold sheen. He appeared instantly above Chen Xi before his palm sliced down, causing the heavens and the earth to be completely locked down by this golden palm, and it caused others to instinctively have the feeling that there was nowhere to hide.</span></p>

The sword was 70cm long, thin as a cicada’s wings, and sharp and dazzling golden lights that were like numerous golden snakes that were twisting and fluttering about flowed endlessly on the blade. It caused the surrounding space to be sliced to the point numerous cracks formed, and the space seemed like shattered cotton.</span></p>

Golden light shot into the sky like a Suncrow soaring into the skies, and then it transformed into countless golden sword shadows that covered the heavens and the earth. These sword shadows shuttled back and forth endlessly as they interweaved both horizontally and vertically to form an enormous golden net that covered all directions as it enveloped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This golden net was woven together with sword lights as the rope.

This fellow does have some ability, but, it ends now.

Unless one was a Core Disciple at the Golden Core Realm, one would utterly be unable learn it.</span></p>

It contained surging Goldflame Dao Insight that locked the surrounding space and sliced out in all directions. Once this move was utilized, there was rarely anyone capable of escaping being enveloped by the sword net, and their fate would be to have their bodies slices into countless pieces of flesh, causing their death to seem exceedingly tragic.</span></p>

If it was any one of them on the battlefield instead, then they would surely be instantly sliced into mush by Wei Yuezi’s offensive might, and it was extremely terrifying.</span></p>

But under the envelopment of this sword net, swift speed seems to already be unable to deal with the predicament before him…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao similarly clenched his fists tightly as he stared fixedly into the distance.
