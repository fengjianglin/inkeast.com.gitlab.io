 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time that the atmosphere in the lotus platform went silent, the old man outside the Book Reserve Pavilion seemed to have noticed something and slightly turned his head while his pair of eyes that were clear and free from impurities slowly opened up, and it was like a myriad of stars had silently emerged in the night sky, causing his eyes to be vast and profound to the point it caused one’s heart to palpitate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, the corners of his mouth curled imperceptibly into a slight arc, and he seemed to be slightly astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stomp! Stomp!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was almost past the Domain of Metal to arrive at the sixth layer, the Domain of Yin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Crimsongold Heavenbreaker! Let me see how you, Chen Xi, fight me while I possess this Dao Art!” Right at this moment, a wave of roaring laughter suddenly resounded out in the Domain of Metal, and it seemed to be extremely ear piercing in this silent atmosphere, causing everyone else to be astounded and raise their eyes to look over towards that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person wore feathered clothes and a black flat crown, had a handsome appearance, and a slender figure. Shockingly, it was Ming Yan who’d just joined the Nine Radiance Sword Sect today like Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan had once entered into confrontation with Chen Xi on True Martial Peak, yet the battle between the two of them was stopped because the Sect Master stood out. Unexpectedly, he’d actually appeared in the Art Cultivation Grounds as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, based on the current circumstances, he seemed to have already comprehended a formidable Dao Art in the Domain of Metal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow took me as his imaginary enemy?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stopped moving and glanced at Ming Yan with interest. The Dao Insight pressure within the Domain of Metal was extremely strong, and it carried a sharp feeling that pierced onto his soul to the point it ached faintly. But this little bit of pressure was unable to obstruct his footsteps either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was only slightly surprised because Ming Yan had actually comprehended a Dao Art so quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His strength and natural talent are really one of the best, but he has obviously taken me as his enemy, it’s truly regretful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? The atmosphere seems to be slightly…” Ming Yan was stunned, and his laughter stopped abruptly while the excitement he felt from obtaining a Dao Art vanished completely like receding tidewater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He swept the surroundings with his gaze and noticed numerous people were looking at him with astounded expression, and they seemed as if they were looking at a freak. This caused him to feel like a clown and be extremely displeased in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dammit, what are those gazes? You don’t have to be like that even if you’re fucking envious that I obtained a formidable Dao Art, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The atmosphere seems to be slightly off, right?” Right at this moment, an indifferent voice resounded behind him, causing Ming Yan’s entire body to instantly go stiff, and his expression changed indeterminately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This voice was too familiar to him, so when he thought about how he’d roared excitedly about completely subduing this person after he obtained a Dao Art, he felt his face was burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dammit! When did this bastard come here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan turned around and saw that familiar figure, causing his expression to be unable to refrain from turning extremely gloomy, and he was anxious and fearful in his heart instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bastard slapped Du Xuan’s younger brother to the point of fainting that day. I haven’t mastered this Dao Art yet so I’m probably not a match for him now. If this fellow charges forward and beats me up in front of everyone now, then… It would be a huge humiliation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother Ming Yan, if you chose the wrong target, then it would sometimes lead to a tragedy.” Chen Xi smiled lightly and couldn’t be bothered to pay any more attention to this fellow, and he turned around and left trippingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief in his heart when he saw Chen Xi leave and didn’t embarrass him, and then his expression went grim as he stared at the figure that was gradually vanishing into the distance with eyes that were spitting flames while gnashing his teeth with hatred.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Junior Brother Ming Yan? When did I fucking become his Junior Brother? He’s simply going too far, and he even spoke about a tragedy? Tragedy my ass!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once I cultivate this Dao Art successfully, I’ll fucking make you taste the feeling of crying for your mom and dad!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan gritted his teeth and fiercely cursed in his heart before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was already impatient to cultivate this Dao Art he’d obtained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he’d just taken two steps when he suddenly stopped moving, and then he turned swiftly towards the direction Chen Xi vanished as his pupils dilated slowly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow actually wants to comprehend a Dao Art as well?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan’s heart couldn’t help but twitch fiercely. He understood that the lotus platform had nine layers and the quality and might of the Dao Art one could obtain would increase along with the height of the layer. Now, Chen Xi was actually walking forward step by step, so didn’t it mean that he was going for the Dao Arts that possessed the strongest might?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bastard’s appetite is really huge. I hope he bites off more than he can chew!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;After a short moment, Ming Yan recovered from his shock, and a wisp of a cold smile couldn’t help but emerge on his handsome face. He didn’t believe that Chen Xi was capable of ascending a higher layer, and he utterly didn’t believe that Chen Xi was capable of obtaining a Dao Art with an even more formidable might from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. For example, Du Xuan and Pang Zhou were both ranked amongst the five great Elite Disciples, yet they’d only obtained a Dao Art from the sixth layer, the Domain of Yin. So no matter how formidable Chen Xi’s natural talent was, how could he possibly compare to those two?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Chen Xi was capable of ascending the Domain of Yin, what about it? It would be useless if he was unable to comprehend a Dao Art from there!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yan felt confident in his heart when he thought like this, and he turned and left. In his heart, he’d firmly believed long ago that Chen Xi’s actions would be fruitless, and there was nothing to pay attention to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, most of the people in the surroundings of the lotus platform had similar thoughts as Ming Yan. All of them had doubts towards these rash actions of Chen Xi’s, yet none of them tried to dissuade him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presumably, they knew clearly as well that since this new disciple who’d just entered the sect dared to fearlessly beat up Du Xuan’s younger brother and agree to Du Xuan’s challenge, he surely had something to rely on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances, it was obviously unsuitable to take Chen Xi as an ordinary disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, under the focus of these numerous gazes, Chen Xi’s figure safely stepped foot into the sixth layer, the Domain of Yin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he didn’t stop in the slightest and continued walking towards a higher layer.</span></p>
