Especially when they saw the handsome young man in an embroidered robe, all the passing cultivators revealed gazes of reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speak softly, didn’t you see the Junior Marquis of the Thunder Marquis Estate over there?”</span></p>

So he’s Wang Zhenfeng, Junior Marquis Wang, who’s well known throughout Thunder City?”</span></p>

Tsk tsk, I wonder who that white clothed young women is. She actually troubled the Junior Marquis to constantly stay by her side. I presume she’s an extraordinary figure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shoo, shoo, shoo. Don’t talk about the matters of the Junior Marquis. Otherwise, if you infuriate him, you can dream of being able to leave Thunder City in your entire lifetime!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhenfeng smiled lightly when he heard the discussions of the passing cultivators, and he seemed to be extremely restrained and confident. But he sighed lightly in his heart when his gaze descended onto the white clothed young woman by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering deeply for a short moment, he said with a light voice, “Miss Ya Qing, you’ve already waited here for more than a month. How about you return to my estate and rest a little? Leave these subordinates of yours to wait here, and it wouldn’t be late for them to notify you as soon as they have news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, this white clothed young woman was the Treasure Heaven Pavilion’s Ya Qing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, she was looking towards the luxuriant forest in the extreme distance with a dazed expression, and she seemed to be lost in thought and actually seemed to have not heard what Wang Zhenfeng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of displeasure flashed past the depths of his eyes, and he was extremely resentful in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Junior Marquis of the Thunder Marquis Estate, I possess a respected identity and extraordinary strength, in what way am I inferior to that kid? But no matter how hard I try, Ya Qing seems to have never paid attention to me, and it’s even to the extent she couldn’t be bothered to say a word to me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet exactly what ability does that fellow possess to actually make Ya Qing wait here bitterly and senselessly for over a month?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s truly detestable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhenfeng was extremely irritated in his heart, and he couldn’t be bothered to conceal his feelings and couldn’t help but say. “Miss Ya Qing, even though the Blacksun Pavilion has canceled the assassination towards that kid, but you ought to know as well how many dangerous places are present between Firecrow Town and Thunder City. Not to mention a Golden Core Realm cultivator, even a Rebirth Realm cultivator wouldn’t dare step foot into it. I think he has most likely suffered from misfortune. What’s the point of us continuing to wait here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ya Qing suddenly turned around, and her gaze was like a bolt of lightning as she stared coldly at Wang Zhenfeng. “What do you mean by this? Are you cursing him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being questioned in an oppressive manner like this caused the flames of rage in Wang Zhenfeng’s heart to surge violently, yet he smiled with a stiff face. “I’m just speaking the truth. Since Miss Ya Qing is unwilling to hear it, then I won’t mention it again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ya Qing grunted coldly and couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to this good for nothing Junior Marquis. She knew why Wang Zhenfeng was clinging on to her like this. Besides coveting her beauty, he sought to establish an intimate relationship between the Thunder Marquis Estate and Madam Shui Hua through her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She even suspected that Wang Zhenfeng approached her because the Thunder Marquis suggested it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, isn’t that the merchant group of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion that headed to Fort Desolate to purchase materials? Since they’ve returned from Fort Desolate, they ought to have obtained some news.” Suddenly, one of the nearby experts spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ya Qing raised her eyes to look over. Sure enough, a group of people were speeding over from the Desolate Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Yan Yan and Yan Cheng who were at the front of the group noticed Ya Qing and the others who were at the entrance to the city. Both of them didn’t dare be disrespectful, and they left the group right away before flashing towards the entrance first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your subordinate, Yan Cheng, greets Miss Ya Qing.” After he arrived before the city entrance, Yan Cheng took a deep breath before bowing with a solemn expression. He knew how great the authority this young and beautiful woman possessed in the Treasure Heaven Pavilion. Even though he was respected as a Grand Appraiser, yet he was absolutely unable to afford offending this young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for your hard work, Manager Yan.” Ya Qing nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Sister Ya Qing, when did you come to Thunder City? If you told me earlier that you were coming to Thunder City, then I wouldn’t have accompanied my father to Fort Desolate.” Yan Yan arrived by Ya Qing’s side before taking her hand and speaking warmly. At this moment, she was completely devoid of her icy cold and proud appearance, and she simply seemed like a little girl that clung on crazily to her big sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ya Qing smiled as she stroked Yan Yan’s long hair yet didn’t say anything further, and she instead asked Yan Cheng. “Did anything happen on the way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Cheng was stunned, and then he said with a smile, “All thanks to Miss Ya Qing, we didn’t encounter any danger on the way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yan muttered excitedly from the side instead. “If we’re talking about interesting things, then there were many. We encountered an especially cowardly pretty boy on the way, and he was downright detestable and like a Young Master. All along the way, he let a woman serve him in every as aspect, yet he himself was cowardly like a mouse, and he was terrified to the point of hiding into the treasured carriage without daring to come out every time we encountered a demon beast. He’s simply an extreme disgrace…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, Yan Yan raised her eyes to look yet noticed that Ya Qing seemed to be utterly not listening to her, and Ya Qing was staring blankly towards the distance with an absent-minded expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yan followed along her gaze to look over and instantly saw Chen Xi who’d walked down from the treasured carried, and her expression once again returned to its icy cold and proud state as she said swiftly, “Big Sister Ya Qing, look, quickly. He’s the cowardly pretty boy I spoke of. Eh, he’s actually walking over here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Cheng faintly felt that something was slightly amiss.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gaze Miss Ya Qing is looking at Chen Xi with seems…to be slightly excited? It’s even to the extent the sockets of her eyes are suffused with a red color!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Chen Xi had already walked over, and Yun Na was naturally following by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yan Yan saw Chen Xi swagger over here while Yun Na who was beside him was like a servant that was treated unjustly, she had a bellyful of anger as she waved her hand and said, “There’s no need to bid us farewell. Leave quickly, we only brought you along since it was on the way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But to her astonishment, Chen Xi actually didn’t spare her a glance, and he directly arrived by Ya Qing’s side before smiling speaking with a light voice. “So you arrived at Thunder City since long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yan’s beautiful eyes were stared wide open.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This cowardly pretty boy actually knows Big Sister Ya Qing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You bastard!” Ya Qing raised her tiny fists and fiercely pounded Chen Xi’s chest as she cursed while gnashing her teeth, and her tears seemed like dropping pearls from a broken necklace and poured down her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her reaction was truly too intense, and it caused everyone to be dumbstruck and be at a loss for what to do. But only Ya Qing herself knew the fear and uneasiness she endured in her heart during these days after she found out that Chen Xi was about to face the Blacksun Ambush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know why she would become like this, nor did she know from which moment did Chen Xi become a figure that lingered within her mind. All she knew was that when Chen Xi who she yearned to see all day and night had appeared safely before her at this moment, she really wanted to cry. Even though she’d warned herself to be more restrained and enduring, when this time really came, how could she possibly endure her tears?</span></p>
