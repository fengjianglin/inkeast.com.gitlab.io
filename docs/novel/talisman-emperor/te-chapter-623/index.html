 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competition between the Seed Disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect was brutal to the extreme, and it was like purgatory. The strong survived, while the weak could only be reduced to be subordinates. If one was unable to endure it, then one could choose to leave and head to the inner court or outer court to be an elder, and one could still cultivate and comprehend the Dao as usual. But one’s accomplishments could only stop here and completely lose all fate one had with becoming a true top expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the growth of an expert couldn’t do without the baptism of blood and fire. If one was even unable to endure this level of competition, then how could one fight for supremacy with the heavens and the earth and go against the Grand Dao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the West Radiance Peak’s Huo Molei and the others. Their cultivations were really high, yet they weren’t skilled in battle, and if it wasn’t for the protection of Madman Liu and Chen Xi’s assistance, they’d probably have been eliminated from this playing field a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all was said and done, if one wanted to become an expert, then one’s cultivation was the foundation, and one couldn’t do without competition and tempering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason the competition between the Seed Disciples of Divine Radiance Peak was so brutal was absolutely because the higher-ups of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect intended it to be like this, and it was for the sake of washing away the sand and selecting the true geniuses that could be pillars that could endure great responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Wang Zhonghuan! Swiftly come rescue us!” Those East Radiance Peak disciples that were confined by Chen Xi with those rays that were like chains were utterly incapable of moving, and they couldn’t help but howl in their terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt his entire body shake as an enormous force that was like an abyss descended with the intention of completely crushing him, and it was arrogant to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi swept his gaze up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw a young man in a golden robe was suddenly standing proudly beneath the extremely distant sky. His figure was slender, and he was extremely handsome while his dense golden hair fluttered in the wind, causing him to seem like the son of a Suncrow, arrogant and overbearing. He possessed a bearing of looking down arrogantly upon the world and everything on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person is Wang Zhonghuan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed as he recalled the introduction Luo Qianrong gave him earlier. This person possessed great karmic luck, deep fortune, superb natural talent, and deeply received the favor of seniors that were in seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His temperament was peerlessly ferocious. Even though he’d only entered the Divine Radiance Peak 13 years ago, yet he’d already advanced to become a top figure amongst the Seed Disciples, and he possessed a matchlessly formidable strength that couldn’t be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most shocking of it all was Wang Zhonghuan possessed a real Immortal Artifact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to logic, even though he was unable to bring forth the true might of an Immortal Artifact with his current cultivation, yet if it was against those of the same generation, it was undoubtedly a great weapon of destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi originally thought that ‘Senior Brother Nie’ and the others were put up to provoking him by Yun Ye, but Wang Zhonghuan’s appearance now allowed him to instantly understand that he’d underestimated how overbearing the disciples of East Radiance Peak were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, Luo Qianrong intended to arrange his abode to be on the Dark Brilliance Spirit Vein, yet it ended with failure. The reason was that the three empty abodes on the Dark Brilliance Spirit had been forcefully occupied by Wang Zhonghuan, and he’d spread the word that he’d kept them for Leng Qiu, Pang Zhou, and Du Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now Leng Qiu and the others had been defeated by him during the Peak Trials, causing them to have their fate with the position of Seed Disciple severed. Logically speaking, this matter ought to have passed just like that. But now it would seem like this Wang Zhonghuan obviously felt that Chen Xi had spoiled his arrangements, and he didn’t intend to let Chen Xi off. So he still continued pursuing Chen Xi even after Chen Xi had moved to the Crimson Origin Spirit Vein, and he was going too far!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi! A new disciple like you actually dares to go against my will and humiliate the junior brothers I sent over like this? Do you know that you’re challenging my dignity by doing this!?” The golden robed young man, Wang Zhonghuan’s, voice sounded out from the sky. His voice wasn’t loud yet sufficient to spread throughout this area, and it carried a sense of dignity, arrogance, and conceit, like the descendant of a god arriving in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your will? Could it be that you think you’re a god?” Chen Xi said coldly, “You’re only a Seed Disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, yet you dare speak so arrogantly and act as you please, could it be that you’ve really taken this place to be your own house?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Audacious! You humiliated the disciples of my East Radiance Peak yet don’t repent, and you’re ill-mannered and talking back instead. Looks like I must properly punish you today!” Wang Zhonghuan’s voice wasn’t loud yet carried a feeling of terrifying coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re trying to put the blame on me? You ought to know that it was they that provoked me first.” Chen Xi spoke indifferently, yet wasn’t afraid in the slightest, and he carried a composed aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what? No matter what your reason it, the disciples of my Easy Radiance Peak can only be dealt with by my East Radiance Peak. Who do you think you are?” Wang Zhonghuan spoke with a light voice, yet all his words revealed undisguised arrogance and contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Is that so?” Chen Xi smiled before raising his hand and pressing down, causing those East Radiance Peak disciples to instantly let out shrill howls as their bodies knelt down uncontrollably onto the ground, and their appearance were miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was equivalent to using actions to tell Wang Zhonghuan.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if they’re disciples of your East Radiance Peak? Since they dared to offend me, Chen Xi, they have to kneel and suffer punishment all the same!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re… courting death!” Wang Zhonghuan was stunned, and then he exploded into rage and withdrew a large multicolored and glazed bow. At the instant it appeared, an indescribable aura appeared in the heavens and the earth, and then five ferocious beast phantoms</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that were coiled in the colors of the five elements let out roars that shook the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hiss!” A wave of gasps resounded out in the distances. It turned out that since an unknown period of time ago, the vicinity of the Crimson Origin Spirit Vein was already filled with numerous figures that were watching the show, and they revealed a wisp of shock when they saw Wang Zhonghuan withdraw this bow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quasi Immortal Artifact — Savage Five Element Bow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to rumor, this bow was forged from the tendons of five types of ferocious beasts, namely the Troar, Soarserpent, Bronze Ant, Crimson-tailed Ape, and Aquagale Mink, and it contains the five elements. As soon as it’s utilized, the five elements would combine into one, causing its might to be terrifying to the extreme.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Zhonghuan stretched out his hand and placed it onto the bow before lightly pulling on it to the point it formed the shape of a full moon and erupted with five colored divine light that illuminated the heavens and the earth. Moreover, dragon roars and tiger howls resounded out from within it while it enveloped his entire body within a blazing glow, causing him to possess shocking divine might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi revealed a serious expression as True Essence surged throughout his body and glowed, and he stared at Wang Zhonghuan who was beneath the distant sky while being prepared to meet him in battle. Since this person was capable of being ranked into the top amongst Seed Disciples, his strength was naturally extraordinary, and he’d even withdrawn a Quasi Immortal Artifact bow with shocking might at this moment, causing Chen Xi to not dare be careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, a dazzling five colored light arrow tore through the sky and shot out explosively with a speed so swift that it wasn’t inferior to teleportation, and it carried the oppressive might and aura of penetrating through all obstacles and annihilating everything.</span></p>

The might of this arrow was too great, and Wang Zhonghuan had obviously attained a shocking height in the Dao of Archery, so its edge couldn’t be taken head on.</span></p>

Everywhere the five colored light arrow passed, violent winds rages as rocks shattered, and even space itself had a horrifying and narrow rift split apart on it.</span></p>

It was obvious from this that this Savage Five Element Bow was absolutely a terrifying Quasi Immortal Artifact!</span></p>

Wang Zhonghuan was like a god that drew a large bow with great strength, and he shot out numerous dazzling and resplendent five colored light arrows once more, causing them to tear through the sky while locked onto Chen Xi.</span></p>

His hands shook repeatedly as an ancient symbol that was coiled with divine light emerged on his palm, and he once again dealt with the attacks that pressed down upon him one after the other.</span></p>

No wonder you dared be so arrogant. But this is far from enough. I’ve only brought forth less than a tenth of my strength.

All of them knew clearly that if an ordinary Nether Transformation Realm cultivator were to face this attack, the cultivator would surely be completely annihilated by this arrow and not even have the chance to struggle.</span></p>

During the primeval times, every single expert that was capable of flawlessly mastering the Dao of Archery was a supreme expert that shook the three dimensions, and they were capable of shooting through the stars, sun, and universe with peerless might!</span></p>
