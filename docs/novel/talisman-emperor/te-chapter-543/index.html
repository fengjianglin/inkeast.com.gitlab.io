 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way he said ‘fuck off’ was so overbearing to the point it seemed that he didn’t even take Bing Shitian who was a Heavenly Immortal seriously, and his arrogant expression caused everyone present to feel suffocated and reveal astonished expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhen Liuqing and the others were stunned as they utterly never imagined that this dirty geezer who was usually slovenly and had a grumpy temper would actually have such an overbearing side, and it was simply unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you speaking to me?” Bing Shitian’s face sank, and his icy cold gaze could almost kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who else? If it was your true body present here, then perhaps I would be slightly afraid. But now, I’m completely certain of being able to annihilate you.” Madman Liu rolled his eyes as he spoke with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really think that no one is capable of restraining you if you hide in the Mortal Dimension?” Flames of rage roiled within Bing Shitian’s eyes as he was completely furious this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was he? He was a supreme Heavenly Immortal. So when had he suffered such treatment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was a tiny ant that repeatedly offended his honor, and now a dirty geezer had jumped out and spoken disrespectfully to him. All of this caused Bing Shitian to be enraged to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood flows into rivers when an Emperor is enraged, and when a Heavenly Immortal is enraged, it could even destroy a small world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Bing Shitian was only an External Avatar at this moment, if he were to risk his life, then the destructive force he emitted would absolutely be something unbelievable to everyone present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? You really want to try?” Madman Liu took a step forward, causing his goatee to flutter as a terrifying aura that caused the heavens and the earth to be cast into a shadow gushed out explosively from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the killing intent that belonged to a Heavenly Immortal. When the heavens emitted killing intent, the stars and constellations moved; when the earth emitted killing intent, all living creatures moved, and when a mortal emitted killing intent, the heavens and earth were overturned, whereas the killing intent of a Heavenly Immortal was sufficient to destroy an entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! The ignorant are really fearless!” Bing Shitian sneered, and with a flip of his hand, a decree that glowed with brilliant golden light and emitted blazing rays of immortal light floated on his palm. At the instant it appeared, it actually emanated supreme majesty that caused everyone to wish for nothing more than to kneel down in worship and pray devotedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A decree of the Immortal Dimension!?” Madman Liu’s eyes suddenly erupted with a wisp of cold lights, and he was slightly shocked and seemed to be surprised that such a treasure would appear in the hands of Bing Shitian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I shouldered the mission of the Immortal Dimension to investigate the source of the upheaval of the three dimensions when I descended to the Mortal Dimension this time, whereas this treasure had naturally fallen into my hands.” Bing Shitian roared with laughter, and his voice was icy cold to the extreme. “This decree is only an Immortal Artifact to others, and it’s nothing special. But it’s different for you. You’re a forsaker of the heavens, so how long can you hide once I utilize this decree?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Madman Liu’s expression had finally turned grim. Bing Shitian was right, the decree of the Immortal Dimension had the supreme will that belonged solely to the Immortal Dimension branded upon it. Once someone like him that had ascended to become a Heavenly Immortal yet hadn’t ascended into the Immortal Dimension encountered the summons of a decree of the Immortal Dimension, then he would be forcefully drawn into the Immortal Dimension in less than the time for an incense stick to burn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, very good! You, Bing Shitian, actually possess such a treasure. You’ve indeed opened my eyes today, but…” Madman Liu sneered as a wisp of ruthlessness flashed on his face. “Do you think I’m unable to kill you before I’m drawn into the Immortal Dimension?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian’s expression froze, and then he laughed coldly. “Why don’t you try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere was all set for a showdown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The collision between these two great figures caused everyone in the surroundings to feel utterly horrified, and they were completely incapable of interfering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those emissaries of the Dark Reverie had serious expressions and were extremely terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the hearts of everyone was at their throats as they looked at the battle between Heavenly Immortals that was about to erupt, causing them to feel as if their souls were about to leave their bodies, and they wished for nothing more than to turn around and flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. Once both of them fought, this expanse of the heavens and the earth would probably be destroyed, and they would absolutely die a graveless death if it were to affect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this silence, Chen Xi looked silently at the gaunt figure that stood before him, and he felt warm and sorrowful, but mostly furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely because of Bing Shitian alone, so many things had happened today. He’d implicated Chen Xi’s companions to the point of being unable to enter any power of the Dark Reverie, and now even Madman Liu was implicated. All this caused Chen Xi to be furious to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, do you still remember what I said? If both of us join forces, then I have a 30% certainty in being able to heavily injure or even kill him. You can consider this.” While his entire heart was interwoven with rage and resentment, the voice of the tiny cauldron suddenly resounding out in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">30%!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he heard this extremely low amount of certainty, Chen Xi’s mind that was almost lost to his rage instantly sobered up greatly, and his blood red eyes stared fixedly at Bing Shitian who was laughing coldly as he said abruptly, “Senior Liu, think you for your good intentions this time. If I have the chance, I’ll surely repay you in the future. Now, please move away temporarily and leave this matter to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s voice that sounded out abruptly seemed to be extremely unexpected in this silent and nervous atmosphere. In the next moment, the gazes of everyone that was surprised and bewildered shot over to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that this kid wants to sacrifice himself in exchange for Madman Liu’s safety?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t talk nonsense! You stand over there obediently!” Madman Liu frowned as he shouted in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, I might encounter situations that are even more dangerous than this in the future. What should I do if you aren’t present at that time?” Chen Xi said calmly, “Allow me to do this. Bing Shitian is my enemy, and if I don’t even have the courage to go against him, then it’ll probably be impossible for me to become an immortal in my entire lifetime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Madman Liu intended to flare up yet as soon as he encountered Chen Xi’s gaze, his heart trembled for no reason, and he was actually stunned to the point of speechlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of gaze was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was calm and clear like snow, with resolution and firmness deep within, and it was like the gaze of a fearless warrior on the battlefield. Even if the road ahead was covered in thorns, mountains of blades, and seas of flames, it would be unable to make him frown in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Do you think that you’ll be able to ensure the safety of everyone if you do this?” Bing Shitian suddenly roared with laughter, and his voice revealed dense disdain. “I’ve already decided that it isn’t just you, even your companions will all be unable to enter the Dark Reverie!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the surroundings gasped, and they understood in their hearts that Bing Shitian had probably aroused the intent to kill because of Chen Xi’s repeated offense. As soon as these words were spoken, they were surely impossible to be changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, it’s alright. Even if we die today, we still support your decision!” Huangfu Qingying and the others seemed to be extremely composed instead when facing this scene, and all of them spoke out successively with support towards Chen Xi. Obviously, they’d already prepared themselves for death at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi turned around, and the thought in his mind from before grew even firmer as he looked at the firm expressions on the faces of Huangfu Qingying and the others. “Don’t worry. No one is capable of obstructing us from entering the Dark Reverie today!”</span></p>

Shameless boasting! Let me see what ability a tiny ant like you possesses to talk so big!” Bing Shitian sneered.</span></p>

Perhaps there’ll be a favorable turn of events.”</span></p>

Every single step of the figure shook the surrounding space to the point of shattering while the earth quaked, and its impetus was shocking to the extreme.</span></p>

The figure’s eyes were like two enormous lakes that reflected a river of stars, his beard that was 3km long that densely covered his face hung down like a pitch black waterfall, his brows were like two mountains that lay across the earth, and his appearance was craggy and extremely dignified.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Sage, Heaven Trampler, was a formidable ox demon that came from the Unknown Lands of the Dark Reverie, and he’d lived for countless years. Supposedly, he’d once annihilated a Heavenly Immortal and was extremely lawless in his actions, causing him to seem like the devil incarnate.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing was standing right there and being looked at like this by Heaven Trampler actually caused her to have a feeling of familiarity.</span></p>
