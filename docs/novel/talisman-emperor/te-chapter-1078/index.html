 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Luo Clan’s Patriarch, Luo Dufu looked at Luo Zifeng with an emotionless expression as he said in a low voice, “I require an explanation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Dufu’s figure was bony, his brows sparse, and he was like an extremely ordinary old man. But when he spoke, it carried a domineering aura that didn’t conform to his appearance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if his thin figure contained a volcano and boundless might.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Dufu remained expressionless and looked silently at Luo Zifeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really needed an explanation and not whether it was worth or not. After all, a dispute between them and the Yin Clan had formed because of a single young man, and it didn’t conform to the interests of the Luo Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi’s natural talent and combat strength exceed ordinary geniuses, and since I’ve started cultivating until now, it’s the first time I’ve seen such an extraordinary figure.” Luo Zifeng was clearly aware of his father’s disposition, and he pondered deeply before he explained. “Of course, I’m well aware that if it was only this, then I can only take him to be a genius that should be won over and made friends with. But when I saw the weapon in his possession, I decided that I had to help him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he raised his hand and executed a profound immortal art, and it condensed a screen that was suffused with jade white divine mist. Shockingly, a simple immortal sword floated into appearance on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The immortal sword was pitch black and simple, its blade a meter long, and it was held in a white, slender, and strong palm. It revealed a pose of slashing down in midair, and one could faintly see that the blade of the sword surged with a myriad of dense talisman markings that emanated boundless divine light that was dazzling and resplendent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Dufu’s gaze moved to descended on it before sizing it up silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng didn’t speak any further and waited silently. He knew that with his father’s discerning ability, his father would surely be able to notice something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, after a short moment, Luo Dufu’s gaze suddenly emanated a wisp of dazzling divine radiance, and it was like a scorching sun that suddenly surged into appearance with blazing and awe-inspiring might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Talisman Armament!” &nbsp;He spoke word by word with a voice that revealed a strand of shock, and it was like muffled thunder that reverberated in the spacious hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng was terribly shocked in his heart as well when he heard this. He’d merely suspected it earlier, and he was only 70 or 80% sure that it was a Talisman Armament. But when he heard his father confirm it, besides feeling relaxed in his heart, a wisp of shock arose in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is turns out that it really is as I guessed. It’s real!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it really is a Talisman Armament. Divine Talismans are contained within it and form talisman diagrams, an ordinary Immortal Artifact can’t compare to it at all…” Luo Dufu sized it up carefully once more. Unfortunately, it was only a screen condensed from an immortal art in the end, and it wasn’t real, so he was unable to discern even more secrets from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was sure that it was absolutely a Talisman Armament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that the Liang Clan has grasped the method to refine this treasure?” Luo Dufu seemed to have thought of something, causing his eyes to narrow while he pondered deeply and muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng knew his father had misunderstood when he heard this, and he said immediately, “Father, that’s absolutely not something the Liang Clan is capable of refining. Otherwise, Liang Bing would have probably refined her Silverlight Shuttle once more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a moment and continued. “It isn’t just the Liang Clan, even our Luo Clan and the Gu Clan haven’t been able to grasp the method to refine a Talisman Armament.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Luo Dufu frowned and chuckled. “Could it be that you think this treasure was refined by that young man?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng said seriously, “Exactly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Dufu’s brows knit even more tightly together. Obviously, he felt these words were too absurd, yet he still asked patiently. “What’s the reason?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, please take a look.” Luo Zifeng withdrew a jade slip and activated it this time, and it revealed numerous scenes. &nbsp;Surprisingly, it was the scenes of the banquet that Liang Bing held a few days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the scene was a tall and handsome young man standing on an arena. He held a talisman brush in hand while casually drawing repeatedly, and then he placed the talisman down. The entire process was no less than twenty five breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, the screen from the jade slip flashed once more, and it revealed the miraculous scene of a river of stars filling the sky. The specks of stars densely covered the veil of night, and it was profound, vast, and overflowing with starlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the screen from the jade slip vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Luo Dufu fell into deep contemplation. He stared blankly and silently, and he didn’t return to his senses for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Any Talisman Formation Grandmaster can craft this first talisman of the Seven Forbidden Talismans. But very few are capable of crafting it within twenty five breaths of time, whereas amongst our four great clans, there isn’t a single person capable of crafting one that reveals the phenomena of a river of stars filling the sky in such a short period of time.” Luo Zifeng spoke slowly, and he couldn’t conceal his emotion as he said, “But Chen Xi accomplished it, and he relied precisely on this to help Liang Bing deal with the provocation of Wu Yifan from the Icesky Continent’s Wu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a moment and continued. “Father, could it be that you’ve forgotten that the ancestor of this Wu Clan had once been a Young Dao Attendant at the side of Oracle Mountain’s Master. In the countless years after, he has always called himself as a branch heir of Oracle Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Moreover, all through these years, the Wu Clan has never taken our four great clans seriously. Yet now, the Wu Clan’s most outstanding young Talisman Formation Grandmaster lost at Chen Xi’s hands.” When he spoke up to here, Luo Zifeng took a deep breath and said, “With all this put together, I feel that even if Chen Xi isn’t a disciple of Oracle Mountain, he definitely possesses some sort of unknown relationship with Oracle Mountain!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Luo Dufu had awoken from his deep contemplation, and he silently listened to all of this before the gaze he shot at Luo Zifeng changed. It carried a wisp of heartfelt praise as he said, “Meticulous observation and careful thought. Zifeng, you’ve really grown up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grown up he spoke of was naturally a form of commendation and acknowledgement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng was delighted in his heart because he was aware how difficult it was to receive praise from his father. Since he started cultivating at a young age until now, the amount of times his father had praised him could be counted with his fingers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this way, the Liang Clan is going to prosper with this kid in their possession.” Luo Dufu sighed with emotion. With his status and identity, he couldn’t help but feel a wisp of envy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, he nodded to Luo Zifeng and changed the topic. “You did well this time. Even if you can’t win Chen Xi over to our Luo Clan, it’s sufficient to form some goodwill with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng smiled and hurriedly declined modestly. He was aware that with these words, his status as the heir of the Luo Clan had strengthened a step further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh, oh Yin Clan. That old goat Yin Dezhao is going to the Liang Clan tonight to denounce Chen Xi’s crimes. I really look forward to the reaction of that ruthless fellow, Liang Tianheng.” Luo Dufu seemed to have thought of something and roared with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Zifeng suddenly asked. “Father, if the Yin Clan infers Chen Xi’s value as well, then their attitude towards him will probably change greatly, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what if they inferred it? According to what you’ve said, they’ve terribly offended that young man. They won’t try to save the situation, and they’ll only eliminate all future disasters.” Luo Dufu said indifferently, “If I was Yin Dezhao, I would do the same. After all, no one knows who exactly Chen Xi is and what relationship he has with Oracle Mountain. He’ll become a disaster if they don’t kill him, and even though they have to bear some risks by killing him, it’s the safest path of action.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since he’s already dead, the Yin Clan is entirely capable of finding someone to be a scapegoat, and they’ll push all the blame on that person to calm the rage of Oracle Mountain.” Luo Dufu said casually, “Of course, if Chen Xi is a disciple of Oracle Mountain, then there’s only one consequence for the Yin Clan, annihilation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He spoke casually, yet Luo Zifeng was horrified from hearing it, and he felt even more reverence towards Oracle Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that this name represented one of the most mysterious sects in the three dimensions. He merely possessed superficial knowledge about Oracle Mountain’s ability, but even that was unable to stop him from feeling reverence towards Oracle Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still that same reason. How monstrous was the authority and might possessed by their four great clans in the Southbridge Continent? But their ancestors were merely Dao Attendants at the side of the Master of Oracle Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though it’s like that, I feel that it’s impossible for Chen Xi to be a disciple of Oracle Mountain. Since the primordial times until now, I haven’t heard of Oracle Mountain ever recruiting a personal disciple…” Luo Dufu sighed. Only he was clearly aware that throughout the boundless ages, countless figures with extraordinary natural talent in the Immortal Dimension desired to join Oracle Mountain, yet none were able to obtain this fortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that there was no lack of disciples from the top powers in the four great continents amongst these people!</span></p>

If he was a disciple of Oracle Mountain, then how could he possibly appear in Southbridge Continent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Dufu didn’t tell Luo Zifeng all of this. Just as Luo Zifeng had said earlier, even if Chen Xi wasn’t a disciple of Oracle Mountain, since Chen Xi was capable of possessing such attainments in the Dao of Talismans and possessed a true Talisman Armament, Chen Xi might be deeply related to Oracle Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>

He did everything resolutely and never hesitated.&nbsp;</span></p>

So these things will be decided by the both of you. Right or wrong, it’s only training.”</span></p>

You’re still too young…” Gu Zhenyu shook his head as he sat along in the hall and sighed.</span></p>
