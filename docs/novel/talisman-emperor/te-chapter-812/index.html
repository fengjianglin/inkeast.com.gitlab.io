 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman stood elegantly at the bank of the lake in an embroidered robe, and she obviously seemed like a woman disguised as a man. But she possessed a type of natural charm that caused every move she made to seem as if the entire heavens and the earth were cheering, shouting, and jumping with joy at her extraordinary and peerless graceful bearing and charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along the way, Chen Xi was curious why he didn’t see Huo Molei and the others, nor did he see A’xiu, Xueyan, or Bai Kui. But when he saw this young woman that was disguised as a man, he instantly understood the reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Junior Brother, long time no see.” The young woman grinned as she spoke with her red lips and white teeth, and she seemed beautiful and delicate. She was like a warm gust of wind that caused others to be unable to help but be subdued by her graceful bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister.” Chen Xi cupped his hand, and his heart revealed a rare state of emotionlessness, and it was calm and tranquil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All those years ago, the first time he met this ‘Senior Sister’ of his was at the rear mountain of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. At that time, the young woman had given him a Firesoul Lotus Fruit and a river diagram fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second time they met was at the oasis within the Oceanic Desert. At that time, Qing Xiuyi and Fan Yunlan had lost their bodies to him through a series of strange circumstances, and they’d turned angry from embarrassment and intended to kill him to keep him quiet. Fortunately, the young woman gave timely assistance and dealt with this calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two meetings were like a passing bolt of lightning, and they’d only said a few words to each other. It was even to the extent that Chen Xi still hadn’t figured out the name of this ‘senior sister’ of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was extremely sure that she was a disciple of the Master of the Manor, Fuxi. Moreover, he’d already taken her to be his senior sister in his heart a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t have the slightest reason to hide anything before her, nor did he ever worry she would act in a harmful manner towards him. This was a feeling of trust that was very difficult to explain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was because her cultivation was truly too high, high to the point he could only look up at it even until now. If such an existence wanted to harm him, then the person had utterly no need to waste so much time and effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad, not bad. You were able to cultivate to this state in a short few tens of years. It’s truly difficult to come by.” The young woman had her hands behind her back while she sized Chen Xi up with a grin on her face, and her clear eyes were filled with an expression of approval.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, you’re too kind.” At this moment, Chen Xi was actually slightly embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman stretched out her slender and white hand to pinch Chen Xi’s cheek, and then she giggled. “You’re about to overcome the tribulation to become an Earthly Immortal soon, yet you’re still so shy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi instantly felt extremely embarrassed when being ‘teased’ like this by a young woman, and his face turned red for the first time ever while he was slightly at a loss for what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I’ll stop teasing you.” The young woman waved her hand and restrained her laughter before she said, “Little Junior Brother, I came here this time because I want to take you somewhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where?” Chen Xi’s expression became serious when he heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ll know once we get there.” The young woman smiled while her pink lips parted lightly, and then changed the topic and spoke gradually. “You probably already know that your fate has been concealed by the workings of the heavens since a long time ago, and do you know what will happen if you try to overcome the heavenly tribulation to advance into the Earthly Immortal Realm like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned. He was indeed aware of this since a long time ago, but he’d never thought that this had anything to do with the heavenly tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s very simple. You’ll be seen as a ‘variant’ by the Heaven Dao. It will send down the divine lightning of judgement to annihilate you, and there’ll be no chance of surviving it.” The young woman’s eyes were as clear as the lake, and she stared at the distant sky as she said, “You don’t understand the might of the divine lightning of judgment. Even a Golden Immortal of the Immortal Dimension would be directly annihilated when taken as a variant by the Heaven Dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was horrified.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The divine lightning of judgment? A Golden Immortal?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It was the first time he’d heard such names, but it couldn’t be denied that he was shocked by the young woman’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A variant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So I’ve always been a variant…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of a complicated feeling arose in Chen Xi’s heart, and he didn’t know if he should be happy or sad. A so-called variant was an existence that was different from normal, and as for if this difference was good or bad, only the heavens knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But Little Junior Brother, there’s no need to worry because the place I’m taking you to is sufficient to deal with this problem.” The young woman smiled lightly, and her clear eyes were alluring as she said while totally unconcerned. “Once you’re truly standing proudly in the three dimensions, you’ll understand that the so-called Dao of the Heavens isn’t invincible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and nodded. “Thank you for your guidance, Senior Sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, he was very curious why this mysterious senior sister of his would be so clear about his current circumstances, and it was even to the extent that she was clearly aware that he was about to advance into the Earthly Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he didn’t ask because there were too many things that were difficult to explain in this world. Perhaps it was just as she’d said, he would understand everything when he was truly strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Junior Brother, get prepared, and I’ll come get you three days from now.” The young woman smiled and didn’t seem to take any action, but her entire figure was like starlight that turned faint from a material state, and then finally vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She came without a trace and left in the same way. She was like the mysteries of the Heaven Dao that was unknown to all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I wonder exactly what sort of place it is. But even if it’s the lair of a dragon or the den of a tiger, so long as I can smoothly advance into the Earthly Immortal Realm, then I must go through it!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the young woman left, Chen Xi let out a long breath of air while a wisp of firmness surged out into his eyes. No matter if he was taken as a ‘variant’ by the Heaven Dao, he never had any fear on this path of his!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Huo Molei and the others, A’xiu, Xueyan, Meng Wei, Mo Ya, and all the youths from the Ninth Hell Tribe were gathered here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An attractive fragrance of meat drifted through the air while everyone drank wine and ate meat, and they chatted happily and with delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Bai, Bai Kui, and the little golden bear, A’Man, were gathered together while eating meat with large bites and drinking large mouthfuls of wine, and they were competing in who could eat the most. Amongst everyone present here, these three little fellows were the happiest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, A’xiu frequently rubbed Ling Bai’s head and praised repeatedly. “How handsome! You’re simply too handsome.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then she rubbed A’Man’s belly and couldn’t contain her joy. “Aiya! What a soft little belly. It will surely be very comfortable to lie on it and sleep at night…”</span></p>

Not to mention that these spirit fruits were tasty, they were all rare spirit fruits, so to these three little gluttons, A’xiu was simply like an almighty goddess!</span></p>

Presently, the status of the West Radiance Peak in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect seemed to have already surpassed the other peaks, and it took the first place. It was mostly because of Chen Xi, but it couldn’t do without everyone present here as well.</span></p>

Both of them had accumulated strength in the Nether Transformation Realm for too long, and they could be said to be erupting after deep accumulation, so it was within reason.</span></p>

But they weren’t fond of cultivation and placed their energy on their various interests.</span></p>

Presently, Mu Kui had already advanced to the intermediate-stage of the Nether Transformation Realm, and his improvement could be said to be marvelously quick.</span></p>
