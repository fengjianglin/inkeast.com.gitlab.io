 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one looked down from high above in the air, the entire West Radiance Peace was like a lotus flower in full blood within the vast mountain range. Its petals touched the sky, it was suffused with divine lights, and it was extremely exquisite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two streaks tore through the sea of clouds as they flashed towards West Radiance Peak, and they were precisely Chen Xi and Qing Yu who’d just returned from True Martial Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother Chen, you’re a disciple that Master just took, so you probably still don’t know that our West Radiance Peak is different from the other peaks, and it only possesses six Elite Disciples…” Qing Yu introduced the situation on West Radiance Peak in detail as they flashed through the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It turned out the Madman Liu had only taken a total of six disciples on West Radiance Peak, and there were only seven when Chen Xi was added on, causing it to be pitiably few and far from being able to compare with the other peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the East Radiance Peak had over 1,600 Elite Disciples, and was filled with talents. Moreover, there were countless maidservants and attendants on the peak. It was the strongest peak amongst the ‘four Elite Disciple Peaks’ of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The so called four Elite Disciple Peaks pointed towards the East Radiance, West Radiance, South Radiance, and North Radiance Peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides the East Radiance Peak being filled with talents and flourishing with strength, the South Radiance Peak wasn’t weak either. The disciples that cultivated on it were all of the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement, and they were known for being valiant and ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, the disciples taken by the North Radiance Peak were all female cultivators, causing it to possess an aloof status, and its strength couldn’t be underestimated either. According to what Qing Yu said, the current number one figure amongst the Elite Disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect was a proud female genius from the North Radiance Peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to this, only the West Radiance Peak seemed to be rather abnormal by only possessing a mere six Elite Disciples, or seven when Chen Xi was included, causing its forces to be weak to the limit and practically have no sense of existence in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is it like this?” Chen Xi asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is Master’s decision. According to what he said, in the matter of taking disciples, it was fine to not take anyone, but if he did, then he wanted to take the best and most unique. Otherwise, if he took a big pile of trash, they would be pleasant to the eye, but of no use.” Qing Yu spoke with a prideful expression, and he obviously agreed extremely with this viewpoint of Madman Liu’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chen Xi came to a sudden understanding, and then he rubbed his nose as he said with a smile, “I never imagined that I was actually able to be chosen as well, I really do feel slightly overwhelmed by the unexpected favor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yu seemed to have thought of something, causing his handsome face to instantly reveal extreme embarrassment, and he really didn’t know how to reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! What bullshit uniqueness?! Junior Brother Qing Yu, I never noticed that you who’s a rather honest person would actually become so arrogant when boasting as well. Does anyone in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect not know of the name of the ‘six idiots of West Radiance Peak?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, Senior Brother Du, stop frustrating Junior Brother Qing Yu. He’s already extremely pitiable. He doesn’t fight back when struck, nor does he talk back when insulted, is there a person more pitiable than him in the world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha…” Right at this moment, a wave of loud laughter resounded out in the distant sea of clouds, and their voices contained unconcealed ridicule and mocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi glanced at Qing Yu who was by his side, and he saw the face of this handsome and pure young man was flushed completely red, and he was angered to the point his entire body started trembling. But he puckered his lips tightly and appeared to only dare feel indignant, yet not dare say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother Chen, let’s go. Don’t pay attention to these bored people.” Qing Yu spoke swiftly with a low voice, and his voice faintly carried a trace of terror and worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait. Junior Brother Qing Yu, don’t blame Senior Brother for turning hostile and being merciless if you dare leave!” A loud shout sounded out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Accompanying this voice was a wave of roiling in the depths of the sea of clouds, and then a few golden rays of light tore through the sky like waterfalls, and they moved with extremely swift speed to arrive in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a group of young men and women, they either wore magnificent feather clothes, dazzling armor, or fluttering dresses. The young men were handsome, the young women beautiful and moving, and they were extremely striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant they appeared, they encircled Chen Xi and Qing Yu with domineering attitudes. Obviously, they’d done this more than once, and their movements were extremely skillful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are all of you planning to do!?” Qing Yu spoke with a voice that slightly lacked confidence, and it wasn’t like questioning tone but rather like the wail of an infant beast when fallen into a difficult position, and the sight of it caused Chen Xi to shake his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi didn’t say anything further. He’d just arrived at the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, he was a stranger in a strange place, and he could be said to be completely in the dark. So it just happened that he could use this opportunity to properly survey the place he would be cultivating at in the future and find out exactly what sort of situation it was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, this Junior Brother is extremely unfamiliar. He wouldn’t be a disciple Martial Uncle Liu just took, right?” One of them laughed with ridicule, and he directly overlooked Qing Yu’s threat before raising his eyes to size Chen Xi up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wore a black robe, had a white and narrow face, and his eyes were filled with an unruly light. His appearance was somewhat handsome yet his voice was like broken drum, hoarse and sharp, and it was extremely ear piercing and unpleasant to the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He seems to be so. I heard the various elders headed out in all directions and searched high and low a few days ago, and all of them brought back some young talents that they’d taken as Elite Disciples. This Junior Brother before us is surely someone Martial Uncle Liu brought back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, in this way, this Junior Brother is a ‘unique’ genius as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Yeah, unique, exactly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the young men and women brazenly sized Chen Xi up. They held ridiculing gazes as they roared with laughter, and they seemed as if they were looking at an enormous joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you… Don’t go too far!” Qing Yu was furious to the point his entire face flushed red, and he roared with indignation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too far? Have we gone too far?” The black robed young man with a sharp and unpleasant voice laughed with ridicule as he said, “Aren’t all the disciples of your West Radiance Peak unique? Did I say something wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yu was angered to the point his chest rose and fell indeterminately, and he was already unable to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even at this moment, he still didn’t have the slightest intention to resist, and the sight of it caused the nearby Chen Xi to sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Senior Brother of mine is truly…too kind hearted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Qing Yu, let’s go.” Chen Xi patted Qing Yu on the shoulder before turning around with the intention of leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was slightly unable to bear the sight of this any longer, but he thought of how he’d just arrived at the Nine Radiance Sword Sect and it wasn’t suitable to cause trouble, so he intended to figure out the situation first before making a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, okay.” Qing Yu nodded repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait! Who allowed both of you to leave?” The black robed young man said coldly, “This Junior Brother is new and probably doesn’t know the rules of our Nine Radiance Sword Sect clearly. Why don’t you stay back and allow us to provide you with guidance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Du Guan! Don’t go too far!” Qing Yu’s face swiftly turned grim when he heard they wanted Chen Xi to stay back, and he seemed to have recalled a memory that he couldn’t bear to recall, causing him to roar with rage. Moreover, his voice started trembling as he spoke because of his agitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re helping to guide this Junior Brother with good intentions. Junior Brother Qing Yu, aren’t you being too rude?” Du Guan chuckled as he spoke unhurriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, yeah. The disciple of your West Radiance Peak is the Junior Brother of our East Radiance Peak as well. We’re all from the same sect, so what’s there to be anxious of when we’re just having a conversation together?” The others spoke in support from the side, and they held ridiculing expressions as they spoke sarcastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Qing Yu glared furiously, and his voice trembled without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine, Junior Brother Qing Yu.” Chen Xi walked forward as he interrupted Qing Yu, and then he faced Du Guan and the others as he said with a smile, “Since fellow seniors want to guide me, a newbie, then it couldn’t be any better. I wonder where we’ll start from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother Chen…” Qing Yu was extremely anxious. He knew Chen Xi’s strength wasn’t bad, but the eight disciples before them were renowned bullies of the East Radiance Peak, so wouldn’t they be beaten half dead if they offended these disciples?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relax,” said Chen Xi indifferently via voice transmission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice seemed as if it had magical powers, causing Qing Yu’s restless and uneasy heart to become much calmer for no reason or rhyme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t continue dissuading Chen Xi but explained swiftly. “Junior Brother Chen Xi, the person in the lead, Du Guan, is from the Nethercrow Clan of the myriad of clans from the primordial era. He possesses formidable strength, behaves extremely ruthlessly, and he’s already about to advance into the Nether Transformation Realm. Every single one of his henchmen possess strengths that can’t be looked down upon, so you have to be careful. Flee if you can’t defeat them because you ought to still be able to make it if you turn around and flee to True Martial Peak now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t help but laugh bitterly without end in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Senior Brother of mine is too kind hearted in the end, or is it too weak and soft?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his concern towards Chen Xi came from the heart, and this was something Chen Xi was still able to perceive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Guan was stunned as he seemed to have never expected that Chen Xi would actually agree so readily, and then he snapped his fingers as he said casually, “Junior Brother, you have great courage! It’s very simple, the rule of our Nine Radiance Sword Sect is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Getting bashed!” A male disciple by Du Guan’s side seized the opportunity to answer Du Guan, and as soon as he finished speaking, the others were already roaring with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others crossed their arms before themselves successively, and they seemed as if they going to watch a show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, it’s precisely getting bashed.” Du Guan said in all seriousness, “There’s great attention to be paid to when getting bashed. It must dispel the pride, laziness, arrogance, wildness, and other bad habits you possess. In this way, the state of your minds would become more beneficial to your cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw Du Guan reveal such an appearance, the female disciple amongst the group couldn’t refrain from laughing as she felt her Senior Brother Du was too good at playing tricks on people, and anyone who fell into his hands would surely be played like a fool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Getting bashed?” Chen Xi seemed to be lost in thought as he nodded, and then sighed with emotion. “This is really an indescribably brilliant method.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That isn’t…” Du Guan had a complacent expression as he spoke subconsciously, and then he realized the person that spoke these words was Chen Xi, and his expression couldn’t help but go grim as he grunted coldly. “Kid, you motherfucking dare…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t finished speaking when he felt something flash before his eyes, and then Chen Xi’s figure had actually vanished on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, a resounding slap sounded out. Every saw that Du Guan’s entire body was slapped flying, and he didn’t even have the time to activate the protective magic treasures in his possession!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mouths of everyone gaped wide open, as they never imagined that Du Guan would actually suffer such humiliation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! You’re courting death, you’re courting death by doing this!” Du Guan was struck by the slap to the point his head droned, and he was completely furious as he let out an exceedingly sharp roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t getting bashed beneficial to cultivating? Now that I speak of it, Senior Brother Du, you ought to thank me because I’m helping you clear your mind to cultivate.” Chen Xi walked forward and spoke with a grin.</span></p>
