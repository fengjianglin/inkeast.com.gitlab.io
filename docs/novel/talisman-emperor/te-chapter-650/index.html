But due to suffering from being trapped within this sea of clouds and being unable to absorb the spirit energy of the heavens and the earth, he was like a violent dragon that was shackled in hell and was unable to escape.” The Yazi Clan expert in the lead took a deep breath and tried his best to restrain the sorrow in his heart as he said slowly, “Moreover, before we came here, the elders of the clan had already stated with certainty that since Ancestor has been trapped here for 10,000 years, he would surely be on the verge of being exhausted to death now. So we were ordered to swiftly head over here to receive him, and so long as he escaped this place of despair, Ancestor would be able to glow brilliantly with vitality once more and recover his former strength. Unfortunately, we were still a step too late in the end…”</span></p>

He seemed extraordinary and outstanding, and he carried the arrogant aura of a formidable leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he spoke, it instantly drew the attention of the others.</span></p>

Now that Ancestor has been murdered, what should we do now?” The others spoke out successively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do? We’ll naturally go take revenge!” Lie Feng’s eyes were already icy cold to the extreme as his entire body surged with a violent and bloodthirsty aura that was piercingly cold. “No matter who it was, since they dared kill Ancestor so brutally, they must pay a heavy price!” His voice was ghastly and revealed boundless killing intent, and he vividly displayed the vengeful nature of the Yazi Clan.</span></p>

Revenge! During the primeval times, even gods didn’t dare offend our Yazi Clan. If we don’t take revenge for this, then how will our Yazi Clan maintain its footing in the Dark Reverie?”</span></p>

We must kill him and seize the innate bone back! Otherwise, the Innate Dao Art of my Yazi Clan, the Godslaughter Burst technique, will probably be lost forever!”</span></p>

That’s the strongest sword our Clan has found since the Primordial Era. Not only does it possess the might to butcher gods and slaughter devils, the key point is that a shocking secret is hidden within it. Only by finding the sacred weapon would our Yazi Clan have the ability to look down upon all the clans from the Primordial Era. So, we absolutely can’t allow it to fall into the hands of an outsider!”</span></p>

This matter must be carried out. Wait for a moment to let me calm my heart and sense it for a moment. So long as I’m able to obtain a slight connection with the innate bone of the Ancestor, I’ll be fully capable of confirming the murderer’s location.” Lie Feng closed his eyes slowly as he spoke, and the energy in his entire body surged while he seemed to be deducing something with all his might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short moment, he suddenly opened his eyes as a wisp of ghastly excitement flashed within it, and then his brows knit together abruptly as he revealed a slightly shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Lie Feng, have you locked on to the murderer’s location?” Someone couldn’t refrain from asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve located him.” Lie Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it’s like that, then Senior Brother Lie Feng, let’s set out right away!” The spirits of the others were refreshed, and they rubbed their palms together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait. I sensed that person’s speed is extraordinarily swift, and he’s actually capable of rushing about madly within this sea of clouds that are filled with killing intent in every corner. He moves as if he’s moving on even ground, and he’s surely an expert. We must be careful when dealing with this person.” Lie Feng warned. “Moreover, according to my calculations, that person is surely rushing towards the Dark Parasol’s Abyss. Presently, all the experts have gathered in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss and are numerous like the trees within a forest. We must not allow others to catch wind of our actions against this person so as to avoid arousing the covetous intentions of others.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There’s also that assassin. I wonder who he is and why he wants to kill me?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s how it is.” Chen Xi heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. The energy within the grey mist was too terrifying and sufficient to annihilate a Heavenly Immortal. If he were to trespass rashly, then he would surely die without a doubt.</span></p>

Only now did he understand that under the guidance of the tiny cauldron, he’d taken a ‘road to ruin’ that was different from everyone else.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But because he possessed a strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul, this ‘road to ruin’ was naturally nothing to talk about, and it had instead become a safe path that he could move through at will.</span></p>

No matter if it was the mountains, rocks, ground… Everything was suffused with a golden color that was sharp and dazzling, and it pierced the eyes of everyone to the point it hurt.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the air was suffused with a sharp aura, and the gale that blew past was like a myriad of blades sweeping by, causing the surface of the mountains to be sliced open with numerous horrifying cracks.</span></p>

Numerous weeds could only be seen in the cracks between the rocks, and unlike the outside world, the weeds here were actually gold in color. Their stems were like fine steel, their leaves like sharp swords, and they emitted a sharp aura that carried an oppressive and fierce feeling.</span></p>

The sharp aura that existed everywhere cut like blades, and if an ordinary person were to come here, the person would probably not have the time to react before being cut into countless pierced.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was extremely desolate because he didn’t even see a single living being after walking a few hundreds of kilometers, and only barren rocks and mountains entered his vision, causing it to seem extremely dull.</span></p>

It seemed like the heavens and the earth had transformed into a swordsman that was willfully venting its peerless sharp aura of metal.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Chen Xi had no choice but to circulate his cultivation in order to feel much more relaxed.</span></p>

Perhaps we have to wait for a period of time.” The tiny cauldron went silent for a long time before replying. “I have to make some preparations. During this period of time, you can do what you want. Hmm, it’s best if you improve your strength.” As soon as it finished speaking, the tiny cauldron fell into silence once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t help but be stunned and shake his head endlessly. The tiny cauldron was too mysterious, and even he was unable to figure out exactly what it was thinking.</span></p>

He’s surely an idiot that came in here accidentally. He doesn’t know anything yet dares to move about rashly. He’s truly pitiable. I’m considering if I should bury him after he dies, and I’ll take the treasures in his possession as compensation.” Someone roared with laughter and carried an expression that was filled with ridicule, and he looked at Chen Xi with a gaze that seemed like he was staring at an idiot that was on the verge of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, carrying on with our journey is more important,” said one of them.</span></p>

We encounter such an interesting idiot with great difficulty, perhaps we’ll be able to obtain a great deal of benefits from him. Hahaha!” That person couldn’t refrain from roaring with laughter.</span></p>

His throat felt as if it was grabbed by a shapeless hand, and he seemed as if he was suffering from a seizure as he struggled while entire body spasmed before he was thrown down from the back of the flying beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump!</span></p>
