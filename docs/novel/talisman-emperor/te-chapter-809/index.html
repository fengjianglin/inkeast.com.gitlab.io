 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew very clearly that the so-called source of sin was the source of all upheavals, calamity, and disasters, and it was condensed from the energies of evil, curses, sin, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the Grand Dao of the heavens and the earth, sin was a type of quintessence energy as well. So long as the myriad of beings in the world possessed intelligence, and there was Yin and Yang in the world, then the energy of sin would never dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like light and darkness promoted each other, Yin and Yang opposed each other, and good and evil fought each other, the existence of sin was the opposite of righteousness, and it was impossible to be eliminated by the roots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this sort of energy wasn’t tolerated by the Heaven Dao, and it was rejected by the people of the world. In the countless years of the past, this quintessence energy had long since been suppressed by righteous of the world and buried in history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, the source of sin was too ethereal, and it existed in the bottom of the hearts of the myriad of living creatures and within every single thing in the world. But when it was all converged together, its might was sufficient to drown the entire world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, that little gold bear had actually said the source of sin was sealed within this thatched house, so how could Chen Xi not be shocked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, in short, just don’t open it up.” The little bear scratched its head and chuckled when it saw Chen Xi remained silent. “Right, Senior Brother, why have you only come now? I’ve been waiting so long for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it spoke, it held out its paw and started counting the time. “A hundred years? A thousand years? 10 thousand years? Oh, it has been too long, I’ve already forgotten.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stared his eyes wide open and said with astonishment, “Who’s your Senior Brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little bear was even more astounded and said, “Senior Brother, was it not Master that asked you to come get me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was dizzy, and he said while staring blankly, “Which Master?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did have masters of his own. Madman Liu could be considered as one, the Master of the Manor, Fuxi, could be considered as another. But he’d never known when he got such a muddleheaded junior brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, never mind. I’ll open up this Heaven Imprisoning Dao Shackles before chatting with Senior Brother.” As the little bear spoke, it raised up the Sky Dao and pushed it towards the golden lock on its neck. But right after that, it seemed to have noticed something and suddenly stopped what it was doing before it said with an anxious expression, “Senior Brother, hide, quickly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi swept the surroundings with his gaze yet saw nothing out of the ordinary, and he said, “Why must I hide?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, he felt something flash before his eyes, and then his entire body was enveloped by a strange force, causing his body to uncontrollably drift up and actually enter within space!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of feeling was too miraculous. It was like a space had been forcefully opened up within a tiny area, and he and the little bear were standing upright within this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Chen Xi opened his mouth and hadn’t finished speaking before a fluffy paw had tightly covered his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother, that bad guy from before has returned.” The little bear held onto Chen Xi’s neck and its 30cm tall figure hung on Chen Xi, causing it to seem like a fluffy doll as it said mysteriously, “You must not speak because even I’m no match for him if we’re noticed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi finally confirmed one thing, this little bear seemed to have lived for very long, but its disposition was ignorant and naïve to the extreme. To put it nicely, the little bear could be said to have the innocent heart of a child; and to put it bluntly, it was simple minded, and the little bear could compete with A’xiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a black shadow flashed out from the stairway, and it instantly arrive before the thatched house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This figure seemed like a god bathed in flames, its entire body was coiled in the glow of flames while only revealed a pair of brilliant and sparkling eyes that were even more dazzling than the glow of flames, and it seemed as if this figure could incinerate the sky and awe the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with Chen Xi’s current cultivation, his heart couldn’t help but constrict while he felt suffocated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really has appeared. I’ve been lingering here for many days and have searched the various palaces, yet I’ve never found the location of the true treasure vault. I never imagined that it would be here.” The man that was bathed in divine flames started laughing when he saw the Daoist temple in the form of a thatched house, and his laughter was very cold, indifferent, and deep, whereas the crimson red flames in his eyes grew even brighter as if capable of incinerating everything in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart shook when he heard this, and then he recalled the mess he saw all along the way and couldn’t help but think to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like this bastard is the fellow that cleaned out the various palaces and herb gardens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But most shocking of it all was that the little bear had executed some sort of profound technique to actually completely cover up their figures and auras, causing the extremely formidable man that was bathed in divine flames to be actually unable to notice them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! I knew that Dao Platform wasn’t ordinary, and if it wasn’t for it being protected by the aura of the Grand Dao that was left behind through the boundless ages, how could this have possibly been hidden from me?” The man was bathed in divine flames as he took a step forward to arrive before the thatched house, and the he lowered his eyes to look at the iron lock that was mottled with rust on the tightly closed door before he muttered. “The treasure vault of the Sky Dao Palace is probably within here. I’ll be able to make all preparations before the upheaval of the three dimensions once I obtain it. At that time, all the natives of the Dark Reverie can wait to be slaughter and ruled!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he stretched out his hand, causing a myriad of flaming glows to surge out from his body and envelop the tightly closed door before him, and then it burned violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Xeno-race expert!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes constricted abruptly when he heard this, and then a wisp of shock surged out from his heart as he’d recognized that the middle aged man bathed in the glow of flames was probably a Xeno-race expert. Moreover, this middle aged man was a great figure that possessed authority over others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man’s strength was at least at the General Rank, and it was even possible for him to be at the Marquis Rank. The Marquis Rank was an existence that was comparable with a true Heavenly Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why would a great figure of the Xeno-race make his way here?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had a serious expression because the appearance of this middle aged man caused him to become even more aware of how urgent the situation was. It seemed that since the moment the Dark Parasol’s Abyss opened, the three dimensions had already started to be put into the situation of an upheaval…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh! You actually dare to resist me?” A wisp of a baleful expression couldn’t help but appear between the brows of the middle aged man when he saw the burning of his divine flames were unable to break through an utterly decayed door, and he couldn’t restrain himself any longer, causing the imposing aura in his entire body to rumble before it actually rose explosively by a great deal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It felt as if he’d opened up a seal on his body, causing his strength to rise steadily, and an aura that was even more terrifying than a Heavenly Immortal seeped out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, this man was like the overlord of the world while divine flames charged into the sky from all over his body, causing him to be terrifying to the extreme and simply be on par with the white haired Xeno-race Saint Emperor Chen Xi had seen within the Door of Profundity within the Dark Parasol’s Abyss!</span></p>
