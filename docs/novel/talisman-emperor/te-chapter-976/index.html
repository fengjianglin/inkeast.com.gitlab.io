 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Comparatively speaking, Wang Yan had died miserably at Tang Yun’s hands while Tang Yun died at Chen Xi’s hands, whereas Ren Changfeng had suffered from the infection of a toxic poison that was incurable. So no matter if it was the ancient Buddhist treasure, the Calamity Ward Green Lantern, or the bamboo slip that had the Calamity Ward Sutra recorded on it, both of them would surely fall into the hands of Chen Xi and Bei Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an indisputable truth, and that was why Ren Changfeng would sigh emotionally that it was destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d planned for one hundred years yet it came to such an outcome instead, so if it wasn’t destiny, then what was it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t dare readily agree to this. He directly moved forward and carefully inspected Ren Changfeng’s injuries, and then he couldn’t help but knit his brows together tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of poison was difficult to deal with indeed. Not only had it spread throughout his body, it was spreading towards his soul, so unless it was the antidote, it was impossible to dispel the poison by relying on any other methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the toxicity of this poison was extremely strong. Everywhere it passed, vitality dried up, causing it to seem extremely overbearing, and if Chen Xi was unable to help Ren Changfeng, then it wouldn’t be long before Ren Changfeng would perish without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Darkblue Nethersky Powder, a secret toxic poison of the Blood River Sect. According to legend, it’s refined from Mandala Devil Flowers beneath the river of blood combined with the baleful qi of ancient corpses. Merely a strand of this poison can take away the life of a Heavenly Immortal, and one can only become immune to this poison by attaining the Mysterious Immortal Realm or above.” Bei Ling said in a low voice from the side, “This sort of poison is extremely rare, and very few people in the Blood River Sect possess it. So, it’s impossible to save him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the poison came from Tang Yun, then perhaps he possesses the antidote. Let me go have a look.” Chen Xi frowned and directly stood up and walked over to Tang Yun’s corpse. He searched it for a short moment before shaking his head in the end because besides some Nether Crystals and spirit materials, there wasn’t any other useful thing in this fellow’s storage magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, both of you. This is destiny!” Ren Changfeng struggled to stand up, and his face was dark green while his gaze was dim and lifeless. He gasped rapidly for breath before he said with a hoarse voice, “I don’t have much time left. If both of you wish to arrive at the other side of the Sea of Misery, then listen well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Sea of Misery is the place the Netherworld Emperor fought with the gods of the world all those years ago. It’s boundlessly vast, and numerous restricted areas exist within it. Both of you have to carefully remember the path I speak of because a single wrong move will cause all your subsequent moves to be wrong, and every single step is filled with killing intent. So, you must not move about randomly, otherwise even a Golden Immortal will get lost within this sea…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short moment, Ren Changfeng’s voice became softer and softer before it was weak to the point of being impossible to hear.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s gone,” said Bei Ling from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bury him.” Chen Xi thought for a moment before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ren Changfeng didn’t forget to tell them the path to arrive at the other side of the Sea of Misery before he perished. He was a person that kept his word, and he was worthy of their respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi immediately made a move to incinerate Ren Changfeng and Wang Yan before sealing their ashes within two jars, and then he tossed them into the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Bei Ling cleaned up the battlefield, and she obtained an Immortal bow, 13 dim gold arrows, a damaged bronze ring, the Calamity Ward Green Lantern, and an ancient Buddhist scripture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the possessions of Ren Changfeng and Wang Yan, they didn’t touch it, and they sealed it within the jar and allowed it to sink into the sea along with Ren Changfeng and Wang Yan’s ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they finished doing all of this, Chen Xi distinguished the direction before leaving immediately with Bei Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

A treasured vessel was like a piece of straw that swayed in the wind and rain &nbsp;as it flew towards the extreme distance, and it seemed as if it would be overturned in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But surprisingly, no matter how the gales howled, the treasured vessel was actually stable like a mountain, and it continued flying forward along a fixed path while safely avoiding numerous terrifying areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within a cabin in the vessel, Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the ground while his finger lightly stroked the Calamity Ward Green Lantern on the center of his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an ancient Buddhist treasure. According to what Ren Changfeng said, it was a treasure left behind by a great figure from the Buddha Dimension, and the flame that burned on its wick was called the Calamity Ward Purification Flame. It was capable of annihilating all beings and crushing all evil. It was a top-rate divine flame in the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, its surface was inscribed with supreme restrictions from the Buddhist Sects. There was a total of three thousand restrictions, and every single one contained pure and powerful Buddha Energy. But most of these restrictions were damaged, and only over a hundred of them were completely intact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even then, the might of this Calamity Ward Green Lantern was extraordinarily great, and it completely exceeded the scope of an ordinary Immortal Artifact. It was capable of comparing to a Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Calamity Ward Green Lantern is damaged to such an extent, yet it’s still comparable to a Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact. If it’s completely repaired, then I wonder to what extent its might would rise to.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Chen Xi put the Calamity Ward Green Lantern down before he picked up the bamboo slip. He read through it briefly before he found out that the sutra contained within it actually recorded the method to utilize and nurture the Calamity Ward Green Lantern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder Ren Changfeng put his life on the line to kill that vile spirit. It was indeed impossible to utilize the Calamity Ward Green Lantern without this Buddhist sutra, and in that way, it would be useless even if he obtained it.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Chen Xi sighed with emotion in his heart before he shot his gaze to the other side. It was a damaged bronze ring that was only fist sized, and it was lusterless and mottled with a layer of rust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He placed it on his palm and sized it up. It was extremely heavy like he was holding up a mountain. Besides this, he didn’t sense any signs of energy, and it seemed as if it was dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Chen Xi to be unable to refrain from being stunned because he clearly remembered that when the vile spirit had utilized the Calamity Ward Green Lantern, it was precisely this bronze ring that had trapped the lantern before taking it away, and it caused the ring to be boundlessly wonderful and extremely formidable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his thoughts, the value of this treasure was so great that it was even greater than the Calamity Ward Green Lantern, yet why didn’t it have the slightest trace of spirit energy at this moment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Void Raid Ring, and it’s said to be able to subdue all treasures. So long as it’s struck by the Void Raid Ring, then any treasure would be taken away by it. During the primeval times, it was a precious treasure that was renowned throughout the three dimensions.” The tiny cauldron explained in a low voice. “Unfortunately, its energy was completely exhausted while taking away the Calamity Ward Green Lantern, and it’s almost impossible to repair it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss when he heard. It was said to be able to subdue all treasures, so if a treasure like this was completely intact, then it would simply be a great weapon to roam freely through the heavens and the earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just think about it, one’s enemy had just withdrawn a treasure before it was taken away by one’s self. How great would that feel?</span></p>

This treasure is a precious treasure of the heavens and the earth in the end, and it’s unique in the three dimensions. Perhaps you’ll be able to notice some traces of the Dao and repair it after you attain the Immortal King Realm and grasp the profundities of time reversal,” said the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
