My son’s natural talent is great, and his strength is extremely formidable. Since Chen Xi and the others were capable of entering the Dark Reverie, then on what basis was he unable to do so? Impossible! It’s surely impossible!” The painful loss of his beloved son caused the Wise King’s mind to be in chaos, and he roared hysterically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Enough!” Emperor Chu shouted loudly with a deep voice. “The one that caused his death was he himself. He colluded with outsiders to harm his companions. Such an unfilial son deserves death!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, a peerlessly murderous killing intent swept the entire hall like a storm and filled every inch of space within it, and it shocked everyone present to the point their expressions went pale successively and caused them to feel suffocated.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the cultivators that had some knowledge of the tests in the Primeval Battlefield were shocked to the limit by this news, and then they seethed with excitement and cheered.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were even able to imagine that when these disciples of the Darchu Dynasty steadied their footing in the Dark Reverie, they would surely bring unimaginable benefits to the cultivation world of the Darchu Dynasty.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

The reputation of the Chen Clan had already attained an unprecedented height, and it was in a period of great prosperity and magnificence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past few days, the entrance of the Chen Clan was ever crowded with visitors, and it was completely surrounded to the point even a drop of water couldn’t pass through. The cultivators from all over used all kinds of excuses to come congratulate the Chen Clan, and the scene before the entrance could simply be described as if a whole town was there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, the Chen Clan occupied an extremely large area, and it possessed an army of 8,000 while its elite forces were spread all over the southern territory. Moreover, with the great support of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, its scale was so great that it already seemed to have become one of the top powers in the southern territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when facing the countless cultivators and powers that came to offer congratulations from all over, the servants were still insufficient. It couldn’t be helped, there were truly too many people that had come to offer congratulations, and even all the inns and restaurants in Pine Mist City were crowded long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the rear of the Chen Clan, within the ancestral shrine. Candlelight flickered while the memorial tablets of the ancestors of the Chen Clan that had already perished were placed there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao knelt on a meditation cushion. At this moment, his face that gradually became more dignified and firm as the days went by revealed a rare wisp of excitement and sorrow, and he was muttering lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was telling his grandfather who was in the netherworld about Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that his grandfather would surely be able to hear it. So he spoke in extreme detail and with extreme patience like a long-winded woman, and if an outsider were to see this scene, the person’s jaw would surely be shocked off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the current Chen Hao was extremely impressive and dignified. He was in charge of the lives of a few tens of thousand of people, and a single order of his could cause the entire southern territory to fall into an upheaval. He was an iron-handed figure that was famous in the southern territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve already stayed here for three days. Aren’t you going to see our guests?” As the sound of footsteps resounded out from behind him, Fei Lengcui had a pained expression as she walked over and spoke in a gentle voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need.” Chen Hao took a deep breath before he stood up, and he’d already recovered his previous dignified appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His forehead was wide and his appearance was handsome. According to what his grandfather, Chen Tianli, said, Chen Hao’s appearance was slightly alike to his father, whereas Chen Xi was more alike to his mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where’re Yu’er and An’er?” Chen Hao held Fei Lengcui’s hand as he walked out of the Memorial Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“On the isle at the center of the lake,” said Fei Lengcui with a light smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, they’ve gone to cultivate again? After those two little fellows found out that Big Brother has entered the Dark Reverie, they’ve been unwilling to return home.” Chen Hao couldn’t help but laugh, and his eyes were suffused with a wisp of a doting expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Painstaking cultivation is the best. Presently, our Chen Clan is prospering with each passing day, and I was worried that Yu’er and An’er would develop arrogance and overbearingness. So it couldn’t be any better that they know how to work hard and cultivate. In this way, Big Brother will surely not be disappointed when he returns and sees An’er,” said Fei Lengcui with a smile.</span></p>

If it wasn’t for him cultivating painstakingly, how could my Big Brother have possibly been able to attain his current accomplishments?” Chen Hao sighed with emotion, and his expression was slightly absent-minded as he’d recalled many things from the past.</span></p>

So, Brother Hao, you must work hard to protect this clan for Big Brother.” Fei Lengcui stared at Chen Hao as she spoke with a light voice.</span></p>

No one can shake the Chen Clan in the slightest with me here!”</span></p>

Their moves were swift, fierce, and terrifying, and every single move they made actually caused space to be shaken to the point of crackling while sand and stone flew about.</span></p>

What was rare was that they were able to cultivate painstakingly and untiringly with persistence, and this quality was far more important than natural talent.</span></p>

All those years ago, Chen Xi had similarly cultivated so painstakingly without eating or sleeping, and he made the best use of every minute of his time to strengthen himself. The only difference between them was perhaps their environment.</span></p>

He wasn’t like these two little fellows who cultivated top Dao Grade martial techniques, didn’t have to worry about their survival, and just had to clear their minds and cultivate to allow themselves to grow into an expert in an extremely short period of time.</span></p>

The upheaval of the three dimensions is at hand, and perhaps being swept into this great vortex will allow him to grow faster…” Ji Yu muttered as his gaze shot towards the distant horizon, and he seemed as if he’d seen through countless expanses of space to look down upon the three dimensions, causing him to seem exceedingly profound.</span></p>
