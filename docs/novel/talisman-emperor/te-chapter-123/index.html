 <p>Chapter 123 – Bad News</p>
 <p>Xie Meng was questioned to the point that he was stunned. He asked himself, if he was Chen Xi and under these circumstances? He would indeed be unable to forgive Xie Zhan for his actions.</p>
 <p>But he couldn’t admit it.</p>
 <p>He was the eldest son of the Xie Clan, which was one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City. Why would he put himself as an equal status with Chen Xi and put himself in Chen Xi’s shoes?</p>
 <p>What a joke!</p>
 <p>Who’d seen a disciple from a great power making friends equally with a beggar on the side of the streets?</p>
 <p>Who’d seen an eagle in the sky worry about the feelings of an ant?</p>
 <p>His status, identity, and the honor of his clan didn’t allow Xie Chan to do this, so he didn’t even think about it before asking coldly. “What exactly do you want?”</p>
 <p>“Kneel down and kowtow, fulfill the promise.” Chen Xi spoke word by word.</p>
 <p>Xie Meng sneered, and the centipede scar on his left cheek warped. “Are you sure you want to do this?”</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi! Forget it. You’ve already won. It isn’t good for yourself as well if this continues. Of course, if you insist on doing this, we’ll support you too.” It was at this moment that Du Qingxi’s group of three stepped up the arena.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the three instantly caused all the cultivators on the spectating platform to be dumbstruck, because they completely never imagined that Chen Xi would actually be related to these three people!</p>
 <p>“Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze and Song Lin. The status and identity of these three aren't inferior to Xie Meng in the slightest!”</p>
 <p>“Interesting! Everything from today is truly too interesting! Causing four out of the six great clans to appear in a short while, this arena battle is truly difficult to come by in a thousand years.”</p>
 <p>“No wonder that kid dares to speak like that to Xie Meng. So it turns out he’s a figure with a great background as well!”</p>
 <p>Indeed, everything that happened today had caused them to be dazed as there were too many things for their eyes to take in. For the sake of a pair of brother and sister that had no background, the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s Yan Qingni was the first to stand out, and then Chen Xi was drawn out. After watching two battles that could be called shocking, when they thought the climax would end here, Xie Meng who’d never shown his face for ten years had arrived unexpectedly. Subsequently, three geniuses that represented three different clans had arrived soon after him…</p>
 <p>All of this was like tidewater that fiercely assaulted the thoughts of everyone present in one wave after another, and it caused their minds to sway to the point they almost lost their sanity.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Big Brother Chen Xi. I and little brother already aren’t angry anymore. Don’t harm yourself for our sake.” Mu Yao held her little brother's hand and walked up the arena, and her face was filled with an expression of gratitude and concern.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi sighed to himself, yet his face was calm and indifferent as before.</p>
 <p>He knew that no matter if it was Du Qingxi’s group of three, or Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei, they were all sincerely thinking for his own good. But he was unable to accept a situation like this in his heart.</p>
 <p><i>Why must I accept it when he makes a concession?</i></p>
 <p><i>Why were Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei refused by everyone when they wanted to apologize?</i></p>
 <p>Chen Xi naturally understood that this was the difference in status, identity, and strength. It was the difference between a tiny ant and a colossus, but understanding was understanding, yet he thoroughly hated these rules of the game that was influenced by all this.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because these rules existed that those utterly wicked and evil people lived for a hundred years, yet those who had good intentions towards others instead died a violent death on the streets. There was no justice, there was no good and evil, and everything was decided by strength.</p>
 <p><i>A life for a life, and repay one’s debts? Karma and retribution, what goes around comes around? So long as one possesses absolutely strength, one is able to wantonly trample upon all that! Who would carry a reverent and devoted heart to care about it?</i></p>
 <p>Enraged or not, Chen Xi had to accept this current situation. Incidents like this happened in every corner of the heavens and the earth. It was playing out at all time, and he was utterly unable to remedy law of existing, that had continued for countless years, by himself.</p>
 <p>But Chen Xi was absolutely unwilling to let Xie Zhan off like this. He wasn’t a chivalrous person that enforced justice on behalf of the heavens, but he had to interfere with incidents that occurred by his side.</p>
 <p>However, what happened next instead caused Chen Xi’s plans to completely come to nothing.</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi? Which Chen Xi?” Xie Meng seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes squinted as he cried out in surprise and bewilderment.</p>
 <p>All the people on the spectating platform were paying attention to the event over here, and after they heard Xie Meng’s words, there were some quick-witted people that abruptly recalled the great incident that shocked Dragon Lake City a few days ago.</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi! So he’s Chen Xi!”</p>
 <p>“I remember now. He’s the fellow that killed the six Golden Hall Realm cultivators and a Golden Core Realm cultivator of the Su Clan!”</p>
 <p>“No wonder, no wonder he was able to win two rounds in such a relaxed manner. So it turns out that it’s him!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The entire scene was in an uproar!</p>
 <p>Numerous gazes shot onto Chen Xi in unison, seeming to want to see clearly exactly how terrifying this youth’s strength was.</p>
 <p>“So it turns out that Big Brother Chen is so formidable!” When Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei heard the surrounding sounds of discussion, the gazes they shot at Chen Xi carried boundless admiration.</p>
 <p>“It really is you.” The gaze Xie Meng shot at Chen Xi was completely serious. When a person had a great reputation, he would exude a great awe-inspiring effect on others. No matter how confident he was of his own strength, when faced with an existence that was able to kill a Golden Core Realm cultivator, he couldn’t avoid weighing the consequences of battling Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“What? Could it be that there’s something different between the previous me and the current me?” As he gazed at Xie Meng whose attitude abruptly changed greatly, Chen Xi didn’t conceal the tone of ridicule in his words.</p>
 <p>“You’ve already completely offended the Su Clan, could it be you still want to offend my Xie Clan?” Xie Meng’s face sank as he spoke coldly.</p>
 <p>“Since I dare kill Su Leng, I dare kill you as well, want to give it a try?” Chen Xi spoke calmly.</p>
 <p>Xie Meng’s face swiftly became gloomy, yet he didn’t say another word. He didn’t want to play a game of who was more ruthless with a madman. Not to mention, this madman was about to suffer the frenzied counterattack of the Su Clan, and it wasn’t worth for him to meddle in it. Du Qingxi’s group of three that were by Chen Xi’s side similarly caused him to be exceedingly afraid. Under these circumstances, it obviously didn’t pay off for him to go head to head with Chen Xi until the end.</p>
 <p>“Young friends, how about you two give this old man some face and write off this matter?” It was at this moment that an aged voice clearly sounded out around the arena. The voice seemed to carry along boundless charm that caused one to feel as if bathing in spring breeze and to be unable to arouse the slightest thought of going against it.</p>
 <p>“Greetings Senior Pure Fortune!” At this moment, even though they hadn’t seen the owner of the voice, all the cultivators present stood up respectfully, then cupped their fists and bowed towards the distant sky, and it was an extremely magnificent sight at the scene.</p>
 <p>“Daoist Pure Fortune is the owner behind the Immortal Assembling Pavilion. He’s a great cultivator with unfathomable cultivation, and even the leaders of the various great powers would be courteous when they met him.” Du Qingxi’s voice that was chilly like spring water entered into his ears, causing Chen Xi to be unable to refrain from being shocked at the same time he came to a sudden understanding. <i>This Daoist Pure Fortune looks to be a formidable figure of Dragon Lake City as well.</i></p>
 <p>“Young Master Chen Xi, this is the compensation of my Immortal Assembling Pavilion to you as a token of apology. Our Pavilion Master said that he welcomes you to be a guest at our Immortal Assembling Restaurant at any time.” The beautiful and refined female attendant walked up the arena once more, and delicate hands held a jade box.</p>
 <p>“I’ve done nothing to deserve this. Please take it back.” Chen Xi shook his head. “Today’s matter will end here. I won’t fuss about it any longer, and I hope that Young Master Xie Meng will adhere to his own words.” Even the owner of the place that was reputed to be the number one place of indulgence in Dragon Lake City had come forward, and Chen Xi could only stop and make a compromise.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! How could the words of I, Xie Meng, be a trifling matter?” Xie Meng grunted coldly, then flicked his sleeve and left.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Chen Xi, if you don’t accept this, then the Pavilion Master will dismiss me from my job.” The beautiful female attendant looked pitifully at Chen Xi as she implored.</p>
 <p>This scene caused Du Qingxi’s black brows to frown, then she stretched out her hand to receive the jade box. “Since it’s like this, I’ll help you accept it.”</p>
 <p>The female attendant was stunned, her gaze swept Du Qingxi and Chen Xi before puckering her lips and smiling, then she didn’t disturb Chen Xi any longer, and she turned around and left.</p>
 <p>Du Qingxi instead felt her heart jerk from the female attendant’s gaze, causing her entire body to instantly feel uncomfortable, and she felt her cheek’s become slightly hot as well.</p>
 <p>“Let’s leave quickly. The feeling of being spectated by so many people is extremely uncomfortable.” How could Chen Xi have not noticed this scene? He coughed dryly right away before walking down the arena, and then he called out to Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei as he walked out of the Immortal Assembling Pavilion.</p>
 <p>“Hey, aren’t you going to see what treasure is in the jade box?” Du Qingxi chased up to Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it alright if you help me take a look?” Chen Xi said casually.</p>
 <p>“Me? Mmm, okay.” Du Qingxi was stunned for a moment before a smile that couldn’t be concealed surged out on the corners of her mouths, and it seemed as if Chen Xi’s words had actually caused her to be exceedingly happy. However, she didn’t open the jade box and instead embraced it tightly in her bosom, and her clear eyes became distant as she thought of something.</p>
 <p>“Duanmu, I advise you to quickly withdraw, so as to avoid affecting our brotherhood.”</p>
 <p>“Bastard! When did I say I would fight for a woman with Chen Xi? Dammit, I only feel like… I feel like I slightly want to drink wine.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll accompany you.”</p>
 <p>“Good brother!”</p>
 <p>“Brothers forever!”</p>
 <p>Song Lin and Duanmu Ze had their hands over each other’s shoulder as they followed from behind and whispered to one another via voice transmission. All along away, it attracted a mass of strange gazes that stared fixedly at this two people that were overly intimate.</p>
 <p>——</p>
 <p>He’d just walked out of the Immortal Assembling Pavilion when Chen Xi suddenly saw Xie Meng standing leisurely in the distance, and he couldn’t help but frown. <i>Could it be that this fellow is not resigned?</i></p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I’ve never changed the words I’ve said.” Xie Meng seemed to recall something, and his expression was relaxed and pleased as he said while grinning, “I waited for you to come out because I suddenly recalled a matter, and there’s was a need to let you know.”</p>
 <p>“Speak.”</p>
 <p>“Your younger brother is a Wanderingcloud Sword Sect disciple, right?” Xie Meng suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi’s face sank, and he instantly understood what matter it was. When he was in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain’s sword immortal’s abode, he’d once overhead that Su Jiao’s elder brother, Su Chan, was the closed door disciple of a great Rebirth Realm cultivator of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>Present, he’d completely offended the Su Clan. If the Su Clan made a frenzied counterattack, it would surely implicate his younger brother!</p>
 <p>When he thought up to here, Chen Xi’s expression became gloomy to the extreme.</p>
 <p>“Looks like you’ve already thought of it.” Xie Meng grinned as he said, “But there’s something you still don’t know. Your younger brother is an extraordinary genius in the Sword Dao within the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. After he participates in the Hidden Dragon Rankings this year, then so long as his achievement isn’t bad, it’s very likely for him to become one of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s Elite Disciples. But if an unforeseen event were to happen halfway, then it would be too pitiful.” As soon as he finished speaking, Xie Meng’s figure swayed before his figure instantly transformed into a wisp of a black shadow that left elegantly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. No matter how high Su Chan’s status is, he wouldn’t dare act rashly in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect.” Du Qingxi consoled from the side.</p>
 <p>“But, there’ll surely be small troubles.” Chen Xi sighed. “From what Xie Meng said earlier, it seems that the Su Clan will be up to some petty tricks that are aimed at my little brother during the Hidden Dragon Rankings. Looks like I have to go see my little brother before this.”</p>
 <p>Du Qingxi nodded as she said, “Mmm, it good that you understand. Feel free to tell me if you encounter any troubling matters.”</p>
 <p>“There ought to be no trouble. After all, I’ll be participating in the Hidden Dragon Rankings as well, and at that time, I ought to be able to help my little brother.” Chen Xi smiled and tried his best to look slightly relaxed.</p>
 <p>“This fellow… Anyhow, no matter what difficulty you encounter, we’ll surely go at it shoulder to shoulder with you. As for anything else, don’t think so much about it.” Duanmu Ze moved over and said casually, “I originally planned to give you a welcoming dinner today, but in the end, we didn’t get to taste Master Yue’s Nine Treasures Banquet and instead set off a string of disgusting things. Come, come! Let’s go find a place to drink wine.” Chen Xi nodded. He’s already vaguely sensed that along with his appearance in the Immortal Assembling Pavilion, the revenge of the Su Clan wasn’t far away.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Daoist Chen Xi, thank you for your assistance to Mu Yao and her younger brother.” When Chen Xi and the others intended to sit in the Six Unicorn Treasured Carriage and leave, Yan Qingni, who wore a jade dress, walked over from afar.</p>
