 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow…really doesn’t have the pride and fighting spirit of a young man.” The smile on Tang Ying’s face instantly vanished when he saw Chen Xi return into the abode, and his expression became gloomy and aloof while he shook his head before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within an abode amongst the boundless mountains, Tang Ying’s figure flashed and entered the abode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Tang Ying!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Tang Ying, how was it? Did Chen Xi agree?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the abode was a few men and women gathered there, and they instantly approached Tang Ying and inquired upon noticing his swift return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, that kid wasn’t even the slightest bit interested in my invitation.” Tang Ying shook his head and laughed with self-ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Big Brother Tang Ying is the most senior amongst all the students in the outer court, yet that Chen Xi actually didn’t even give you face? He’s simply doesn’t respect his seniors!” A young man spoke furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Most senior?” The self-ridicule on the corners of Tang Ying’s mouth grew deeper as he said, “Seniority doesn’t represent strength. All my peers who entered the academy with me are already existences at the Golden Immortal Realm now!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice revealed a sense of loss and depression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others were at a loss for how to console him when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ying was absolutely the most senior student in the outer court. He’d entered the outer court a thousand years ago, yet his cultivation had always remained at the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to advance into the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was tactful and skilled in dealing with people, so no one ridiculed him. Coupled with him having stayed in the outer court for so many years, he’d made friends with many formidable figures. Even though he wasn’t able to advance into the Golden Immortal Realm, the time he had in the outer court wasn’t bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Tang Ying, you don’t have to belittle yourself. If it’s in terms of combat strength, then besides Ning Meng and a few others, no one else can compare with you in terms of combat strength in the Mysterious Immortal Realm.” Meanwhile, the beautiful Liu Yiming spoke with a smile on her face. “Since Chen Xi refused, then we’ll use a different method to invite him to battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the point in possessing an extremely formidable combat strength in the Mysterious Immortal Realm? I’ve only benefitted from the amount of time I’ve cultivated.” Tang Ying shook his head, yet his expression eased up greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Liu Yiming’s consolation comforted him greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister Yiming, what should we do next?” said a black clothed man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others shot their gazes towards Liu Yiming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming felt a wisp of satisfaction when she saw this. She really enjoyed being the center of attention, and for the sake of displaying her wisdom. She pondered deeply for a long time before she spoke of the plan that she’d thought of a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that Chen Xi is from Southbridge Continent, and Liang Ren and Gu Yueming came to the academy along with him. Moreover, the three of them have a good relationship. Since we’re unable to make Chen Xi accept our invitation, then we’ll invite the two of them to the Dao Development Reserve to discuss the Dao.” Liu Yiming spoke slowly while revealing a wisp of confidence. “Once the two of them are defeated and have completely lost face, we’ll tell Chen Xi of this news. If he still values the friendship he has with them, then he definitely won’t remain indifferent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon these words were spoken, the eyes of the others instantly lit up.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This plan isn’t bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But I heard that Chen Xi’s relationship with the Mu Clan and Xuanyuan Clan isn’t bad. Once we do this, if…” One of them spoke hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming’s brows knit together imperceptibly, and then she waved her hand and said, “Don’t worry, we’re only discussing the Dao in the Dao Development Reserve, and it isn’t a battle. This is a tacitly permitted rule of the academy. Every single time new students entered the academy, they would be invited to battle by the senior students.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others nodded in succession when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brothers Hu Hai and Yuan Zhen, I’ll trouble the both of you to invite Liang Ren and Gu Yueming to battle. Remember, you must not allow anyone to get wind of this and allow Chen Xi to find out in advance.” Liu Yiming instructed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, Senior Sister Yiming.” Two young men immediately stood forward and received their orders before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming swept her gaze towards Tang Ying and two other students when she saw this, and then she said, “Senior Brothers, if we’re able to successfully invite Chen Xi to battle, then I’ll leave the mission of dealing with him to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ying nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, of course.” A tall and thin young man in green clothes nodded in a reserved manner. He was called Xing Yuanhang, and he was one of the top figures in the Mysterious Immortal Realm within the outer court.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The first amongst the new students. I’d like to find out if he’s worthy of his reputation.” Another young man licked his lips and spoke while chuckling. He was called Gongyang Longfei, and he was a top figure in the Mysterious Immortal Realm just like Xing Yuanhang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming was assured in her heart when she heard this, and she revealed an extremely beautiful smile that was very seductive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ying, Xing Yuanhang, and Gongyang Longfei were precisely the experts that she’d specially invited to deal with Chen Xi. The reason that there were three of them was because Chen Xi’s reputation was too great. Liu Yiming was worried that something unexpected would occur, so she called over three experts at once to assist her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If even this isn’t enough, then I can only rely on the Zuoqiu Clan’s contingency plan… It’s only a new student. Tang Ying and the others should be sufficient.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming pondered briefly in her heart, and then she completely relaxed when she felt that nothing was wrong with her plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Chen Xi was unlike Zuoqiu Jun, and he wasn’t someone that came from a top power, otherwise she wouldn’t dare get involved in this matter no matter how courageous she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming streaked through the air and tore through the sky as he flew towards his abode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dammit, Starpoints are really difficult to earn. If it isn’t caring for immortal beasts then it’s planting immortal herbs, I either don’t know how to complete the other assignments or the rewards are too low. Moreover, there isn’t even a single assignment for leaving the academy to hunt something that can be accepted by a student at the Mysterious Immortal Realm like me. What a disappointment…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming was rather depressed and was just about to return to his abode when he was stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Gu.” It was a robust young man that stopped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“May I know who Senior Brother is?” asked Gu Yueming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m Hu Hai, and I came especially for Junior Brother.” The young man roared with laughter as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming’s brows raised. “So, it’s Senior Brother Hu Hai. May I know why Senior Brother is looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I come here to invite you to the Dao Development Reserve…” Hu Hai didn’t conceal it at all and spoke frankly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dao Development Reserve!” Gu Yueming was stunned, and then his eyes instantly lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’d seen the introduction of the Dao Development Reserve that was within the Violet Ribbon Starcrest, and he knew that the sparring and discussions of the Dao in the Dao Development Reserve was the hottest activity amongst students to exchange their experiences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, there were usually some wagers in these spars like Starpoints, treasures, cultivation techniques, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, earning Starpoints was what Gu Yueming cared about the most at this moment. So when he heard the words Dao Development Reserve, he was instantly moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly. Is Junior Brother willing to spar and discuss the Dao with me?” Hu Hai smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sparring with my seniors is my honor. How could there be any reason to refuse?” Gu Yueming felt that this Senior Brother Hu Hai wasn’t bad because Hu Hai had actually come personally to invite him. Besides causing him to feel a sense of enjoyment in his heart, he couldn’t help but feel complacent from this. According to his knowledge, it wasn’t just anyone who could be invited to the Dao Development Reserve to discuss the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Hu Hai’s actions was obviously a form of acknowledgement of his strength, so Gu Yueming was naturally extremely delighted to accept this invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s go,” said Hu Hai with a smile. A wisp of pity flashed past the depths of his eyes before vanishing almost instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Gu Yueming’s eyes were filled with battle intent. All geniuses had their own pride. Before he entered Dao Emperor Academy, he was the second ranked existence in Southbridge Continent, so he naturally wouldn’t think that he was inferior to another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was naturally clearly aware that the students of Dao Emperor Academy were definitely extraordinary, but the pride and feeling of being recognized in his heart still caused him to burn with eagerness. Even if it wasn’t for the sake of earning Starpoints, it was sufficient just to have a spar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Hai and Gu Yueming tore through the sky while flying side by side, and they headed towards the Dao Development Reserve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, a similar incident occurred at Liang Ren’s abode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike Gu Yueming, Liang Ren was suspicious, and he rather doubtfully accepted the invitation. He intended to head over and take a look first before deciding if he would participate in this spar and discussion of the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dao Development Reserve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike the other areas of the academy, the Dao Development Reserve was where the students of the academy sparred and discussed the Dao. Battles frequently occurred here, and it was the most popular place in the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one of the Dao Development Grounds at this moment, Gu Yueming’s hair was disheveled while his countenance was pale, and rage that wasn’t concealed in the slightest had appeared between his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were numerous fine injuries on his body, and they flowed with fresh blood, causing him to seem in an extremely sorry and tragic state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huff… huff… huff…” Gu Yueming gasped rapidly for breath. His aura was in chaos while his eyes had almost split apart while he stared fixedly at the ten plus people before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over ten young men and women stood before him. All of them were seniors of the outer court, and many amongst them revealed a wisp of contempt and ridicule as they looked at Gu Yueming’s current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very good, all of you actually intentionally schemed to deceive me!” Gu Yueming gritted his teeth as he spoke. He’d finally come to a complete understanding. They’d intentionally set all of this up for the sake of repressing a new student like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Hai shook his head in the group and said, “Junior Brother Gu, you actually can’t blame all of us. In our Dao Emperor Academy, every single batch of new students would be invited to the Dao Development Reserve, and the senior students would grind away their pride. This had already become a tradition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But why didn’t all of you look for someone else and just happened to choose me?” Gu Yueming’s brows knit together as he questioned in a grim tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Liu Yiming suddenly laughed lightly and said, “You’re wrong, we didn’t just choose you. Your companion, Liang Ren, is receiving tempering on another Dao Development Grounds at this moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Gu Yueming was stunned, and he faintly sensed the smell of a plot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, there’s no need to talk with trash, Senior Sister Yiming. I originally thoughts that many formidable figures had come from Southbridge Continent, yet now it would seem like they’re nothing great.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, Junior Brother Gu, you’re still young, and your path is still long. Don’t bear grudges against us, alright? Winning a thousand Starpoints from you can be considered as giving you a good lesson. This is a precious experience that can’t be bought with any amount of Starpoints. Now that I speak of it, you should thank us. After all, not everyone is willing to guide you like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others mocked him with words that were filled with sarcasm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming’s face was livid while he clenched his fists together tightly. He gnashed his teeth to the point they emanated cracking noises, and his chest was on the very of exploding with rage.</span></p>
