But such a mighty Su Chan had lost at Chen Xi’s hand, and the shock it brought them was obvious.</span></p>

If it wasn’t for that, he would perhaps be able to persist for longer.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Have all of you noticed, Su Chan’s soul seems to have suffered a severe injury. His path of cultivation would collapse after this, right?”</span></p>

Some were shocked, some felt pity, even all the Earthly Immortal Realm experts clicked their tongues in surprise, and they felt Chen Xi was even more extraordinary and had concealed his strength deeply without revealing it completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He won! Big Brother Chen Xi won!” Mu Wenfei was excited to the point his face was flushed red as he cried out loudly to vent the nervousness and oppressive feeling he felt earlier.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hu!” Chen Xi returned to Zhen Liuqing’s side before he let out a long sigh of relief in his head, and his countenance was slightly pale. Earlier, for the sake of heavily injuring Su Chan’s soul, he’s practically blasted out the entire strength of his Divine Sense, causing his sea of consciousness to be completely empty and extremely uncomfortable at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, he had an extremely sufficient amount of time before the next battle, and if he made the best use of his time, he would be completely capable of recovering to his previous state.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, no one can disturb you with me here.” Zhen Liuqing nodded and replied seriously.</span></p>

What atrocious means!” The Warlord Huangfu Taiwu stood in the Devilbane Arena while his hands embraced Su Chan who had fainted, he shouted out furiously with a voice that was like a thunderclap that exploded out in the heavens and the earth, and it contained surging rage that even a deaf person could hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the clamorous noise in Silken City vanished without a trace, causing it to become perfectly silent, and even the atmosphere became oppressive as everyone was filled with shock as they shot their gazes towards the furious Warlord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What difference is shattering his soul to crippling Chan’er’s cultivation? Chen Xi! The battle had clearly ended earlier, yet you still used a soul attack technique to launch a surprise attack upon Su Chan. You’ve openly violated the rules of the competition, your intention deserves death! You deserve death!” As Huangfu Taiwu’s eyes opened and closed, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled, and he shouted out with a loud and deep voice. His stalwart figure was tall and impressive. At this moment, under his explosive rage, his entire body emitted an extremely terrifying aura that shook the heavens and the earth. When looked at from afar, his entire body was like a dazzling sun that brought boundless pressure upon everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi even felt suffocated as his entire body became stiff. Huangfu Taiwu’s extremely terrifying killing intent had completely enveloped him, and it felt as if he was immersed in the depths of the ocean and would drown and die at any moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his expression was calm as he met Huangfu Taiwu’s gaze without the slightest fear. He knew that so long as Emperor Chu was present, he wouldn’t be in the slightest danger, and no matter how furious Huangfu Taiwu was, Huangfu Taiwu could only accept this outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His soul was shattered! No wonder the Warlord is so furious. In this way, Su Chan is completely crippled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, another peerless genius is about to fall, it’s truly regretful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The soul is the foundation to comprehend the Heaven’s Dao. After it’s heavily injured, even if its repaired, it would probably greatly affect one’s future cultivation. The Warlord is so furious and probably won’t let this matter go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, everyone came to an understanding. It turned out that the Warlord was so furious because Chen Xi had heavily injured Su Chan’s soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, you’ve seen everything earlier. Please permit me to kill this kid and seek justice for Chan’er!” Huangfu Taiwu pleaded with a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It can’t be. Since it’s a battle, death can’t be avoided. Su Chan didn’t even die, so why must Chen Xi be killed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention if Chen Xi had violated the rules of the competition, his Majesty would probably have made a move to stop Chen Xi long ago. Aren’t the Warlord’s actions slightly prejudiced…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Huangfu Changtian and the others revealed cold smiles, and they couldn’t wait for the Warlord to make a move and kill Chen Xi so as to vent their hatred for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stand down!” High above in the sky, Emperor Chu went silent for a moment before lightly spitting out two words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice wasn’t loud yet contained a shapeless force that completely swept away the pressure emitted by the Warlord, causing Chen Xi to instantly feel that his entire body was at ease, and he knew that he’d made the right bet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty…” Huangfu Taiwu was disgruntled in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to go against my will?” Emperor Chu suddenly opened his eyes and spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Taiwu was terrified and seemed as if he was splashed with a bucket of cold water, causing the fury in his belly to be completely swept away, and he didn’t dare say anything further. He glanced icy coldly at Chen Xi before leaving the scene angrily, and he actually didn’t even continue watching the following battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This minor incident passed by quickly.</span></p>

Before he participated in the Allstar Meeting, there was hardly anyone that knew of his existence, yet the formidableness of his strength was obvious, and he’d even become familiar to most people.</span></p>

Its defense was peerless, causing his chubby figure to seem like an impregnable mountain, and he was a terrifying opponent that was extremely skilled in defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Huangfu Changtian was overbearing and cold, his moves were grand in scale, powerful and firm, and every single punch of his struck Ling Yu. In terms of the ferociousness of his attacks, he was number one amongst everyone.</span></p>

Their battle together was extremely intense, and they were locked in battle, causing no one to be able to determine the outcome of their battle.</span></p>

This little fatty Ling Yu looked to be filled with joy, yet his strength was terrifyingly formidable, and they wondered which old fellow in seclusion was Ling Yu’s master.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dammit! This bastard is simply an unshakeable turtle shell.

His character was extremely steady and didn’t possess the slightest edge that a young man should possess, but it was precisely because of this that he was even more difficult to fathom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The martial technique he utilized was similarly a sword technique, but it was an extremely rare Sword Formation that was formed from 72 flying swords. It contained the workings of the stars in the universe, and it contained a slaughter formation, binding formation, illusion formation, defensive formation… &nbsp;It possessed diverse changes that fit together perfectly, causing it to be profound to the extreme.</span></p>

No matter if it was attack or defense, they were accurate to a terrifying degree.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, body refiners ruled close quarter combat!</span></p>

Ling Yu was the disciple of an old fellow that cultivated in seclusion, and he’d similarly shocked everyone and drawn the attention of many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Qing Xiuyi, Zhen Liuqing, and Zhao Qinghe were top experts that were renowned in the world long ago, so it was within the expectations of everyone that they would obtain such accomplishments.</span></p>

For example, Huangfu Qingying withdrawing, Su Chan losing miserably, Huangfu Changtian’s extremely grievous method of admitting defeat, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people originally had an extremely good chance to charge into the top five and even the top three. Yet now, they’d left dejectedly, and besides causing everyone present to feel regretful, they couldn’t help but be shocked by the strengths of the people that defeated them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, once one had attained a level like theirs, unless their strength advanced to a higher realm, the gap between each other was extremely small, and it could be ignored entirely. But they’d still lost, and this also proved a point of view. Even if it was the people that were in the top ranks of a realm of cultivation, there was a difference in strength between them, and they couldn’t be lumped together.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
