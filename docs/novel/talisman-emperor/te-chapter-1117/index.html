 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkombat City, Martial Soul Area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Martial Soul Hall that belonged to Southbridge Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thin old man was lazily curled up on a chai within the spacious hall. He had drowsy eyes and seemed to be sleeping, but he was Tie Qiuyu that once issued a Martial Soul Token to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides that, a blue clothed young man sat by Tie Qiuyu’s side. He had strong features, a cold bearing, and a pair of starry eyes that emanated strands of a piercingly cold aura as they opened and closed. Shockingly, he was Liang Ren who was ranked at the fourth position on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Southbridge Continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Liang Ren glanced at the area outside the hall then glanced at Tie Qiuyu who’d fallen into deep sleep, and he couldn’t help but frown. In the end, Liang Ren couldn’t refrain himself from saying. “There are only another seven days before the recruitment day of Dao Emperor Academy. Why hasn’t Chen Xi come?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu’s eyelids twitched yet didn’t open, and he muttered. “Wait a while longer. So long as nothing unexpected occurs, then he’ll surely make it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren’s brow knit together as he thought, and he didn’t say anything in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’d set out a year ago and come to Darkombat City, thus he didn’t have much of a relationship with Chen Xi. He’d merely see Chen Xi from afar in the Martial Emperor Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as a disciple of the Liang Clan, Liang Ren was naturally aware that Chen Xi had a deep relationship with his Liang Clan. In these past few days, many higher-ups of the clan had sent transmission jade slips to him, and they wanted him to take good care of Chen Xi and treat Chen Xi with the utmost courtesy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was even to the extent that the Patriarch passed down an inviolable order that even if Chen Xi were to go against the entire world, Liang Ren had to stand by Chen Xi’s side!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides feeling surprised, Liang Ren didn’t dare be careless. So besides cultivating, he always resided in the Martial Soul Hall for the sake of awaiting Chen Xi’s arrival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the seniors of the clan hadn’t given him any instructions, Liang Ren would still take good care of Chen Xi because Chen Xi had ascended to the fifth ranking on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Southbridge Continent while still at the perfection-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm. Moreover, even his cousin sister wasn’t a match for Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an extraordinary figure was someone worthy of receiving such solemn treatment from Liang Ren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he’d waited for over a month yet didn’t see any sign of Chen Xi, so besides feeling impatient, he couldn’t help but feel a wisp of worry. He was worried that a mishap might had occurred to Chen Xi on the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of footsteps suddenly resounded outside the hall, and it jolted awake Liang Ren who was in deep contemplation. He swiftly raised his head and saw a tall figure was walking over from outside the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow has finally arrived!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren’s spirits were refreshed, yet before he could stand up, he saw something flash before his eyes. The drowsy Tie Qiuyu had suddenly stood up before charging out of the hall with a swish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it turns out that this greedy old fellow was faking it all along, and he’s actually even more excited than I am at the sight of Chen Xi…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he felt slight contempt towards Tie Qiuyu’s action, Liang Ren still stood up hastily and moved over to welcome Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! Kid, you’ve finally arrived. You really made me wait!” Tie Qiuyu had a warm expression as he sized Chen Xi up from top to bottom, and he didn’t conceal his delight and relief at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi smiled, and then he cupped his hands and said, “I was slightly delayed on the way. I’m sorry for making senior wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi, you’ve finally arrived.” Liang Ren moved over to welcome Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Liang Ren.” Chen Xi cupped his hands once more. Liang Ren was Liang Bing’s cousin brother. Even though there wasn’t any relationship between the two of them, yet since Liang Ren took the initiative to welcome him, it still caused him to enjoy it slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm? Little Fellow, you really are extraordinary. Only less than a year has passed since then, right? You’ve actually advanced from the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm to the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm?” Tie Qiuyu was just about to say something when his eyes opened wide before he spoke with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren’s heart shook violently as well when he heard this, and then he sized up Chen Xi with astonishment. Sure enough, he noticed that Chen Xi’s aura was mysterious and concealed, and it was precisely the characteristics of the Mysterious Immortal Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi rubbed his nose and said with a smile, “Senior, Big Brother Liang Ren, can we speak after we enter the hall?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu quickly came to his sensed and roared with laughter. “Right, you really are surprising Little Fellow. Hmph! That old bastard Wang Daolu had eyes but failed to see that day, he deserves…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he finished speaking, he seemed to have noticed that it wasn’t good to say this in front of Chen Xi, and he instantly shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Daolu?” Chen Xi was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, come, come! Don’t mention him! He’s just an old bastard that made me lose 100,000 immortal stones.” Tie Qiuyu whined before leading Chen Xi into the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi, Liang Ren, and Tie Qiuyu sat down within the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren said with a smile, “Now that you’ve arrived, all the disciples of our Southbridge Continent that have the qualifications to participate in Dao Emperor Academy’s test have gathered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was aware that besides him and Liang Ren, Yin Miaomiao, Gu Yueming, and Jiang Zhuliu that were ranked in the top three of the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Southbridge Continent had similarly ascended into the top thousand of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, they would surely participate in Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were chatting, a wave of footsteps resounded once more from outside the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi raised his eyes to look, and his eyes couldn’t help but narrow. It was a man and a woman. The man had a thin figure, wore black clothes, and possessed an ordinary appearance. Only his countenance was ghastly pale and almost translucent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His lips were thin like the edge of a blade, and they were puckered together lightly. He revealed a fierce and grim expression while the aura around his body was calm and obscure, yet it emanated an oppressive aura as well. It was like a volcano resided within his body, and he seemed to be calm, yet he would erupt at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chen Xi’s gaze only swept past this black clothed man before it descended onto the woman by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She possessed beautiful hair that hung down like a waterfall, her figure was slender and graceful, and her skin was jade white and delicate. She wore black gauze clothes, and she revealed a lonely and cold bearing that was like a black peony that stood proudly and alone on a precipice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was precisely the third ranked expert on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Southbridge Continent, Yin Miaomiao!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his gaze descended onto Yin Miaomiao, the temperature in Chen Xi’s slightly narrowed eyes instantly became cold, and it was emotionless like ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Yin Miaomiao noticed Chen Xi as well, and she was slightly stunned before a wisp of hatred and killing intent that was impossible to conceal flashed within her starry eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As their gazes collided, a thunderclap echoed silently!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere in the hall instantly became slightly oppressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren puckered his lips and kept silent. He was clearly aware of the enmity between Chen Xi and Yin Miaomiao, so he wasn’t surprised to see such a scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu resided within Four Divinity City all year long and was the guide within the Martial Soul Hall now, so he was naturally clearly aware about all of this. He immediately laughed as he said, “I’m explaining some things related to the test to Chen Xi right now, do the both of you wish to listen to it as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao glanced at Chen Xi with an icy cold gaze once more before withdrawing her gaze, and then she shook her head and said, “There’s no need.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she turned around and walked towards the depths of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many chambers within the hall, and they were residences prepared for the disciples that would be participating in the recruitment test of Dao Emperor Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Yin Miaomiao left, the atmosphere in the hall eased up greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the next moment, this atmosphere was destroyed by a voice. “In the past, you weren’t worthy to challenge Miss Miaomiao. Now, you’re still unworthy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the black clothed young man walked into the hall, he stopped briefly by Chen Xi’s side, and he didn’t even spare a glance at Chen Xi. He just stared at Yin Miaomiao’s figure that was on the verge of vanishing into the depths of the hall as he said calmly, “Moreover, to tell you the truth, you’ll probably be eliminated in the first round of the tests with your current ranking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was low, hoarse, calm, and revealed a forceful aura. It was like he was casually describing a fact, and there was no ridicule or disdain present in his voice, yet it was the greatest form of disregard and denial of Chen Xi’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he finished speaking, the young man left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the beginning until the end, he didn’t even spare a glance at Chen Xi. Similarly, Liang Ren and Tie Qiuyu didn’t arouse his interest at all, so he disregarded them as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed as if besides himself, only Yin Miaomiao existed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren’s expression was slightly gloomy as he grunted coldly. “What a bastard! He was bought over by Yin Miaomiao with just a bottle of Divineline Pills!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu’s expressions remained unchanged, and he grinned as he glanced at Chen Xi and said, “That little fellow is Jiang Zhuliu. You seem to not recognize him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded. “I don’t know him, but I don’t want to know him in the future either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi wasn’t irritated by Jiang Zhuliu’s repeated denial of his strength. Chen Xi was only slightly disappointed because he’d frequently heard others say that Jiang Zhuliu was an extraordinary and shocking figure. Jiang Zhuliu was of low birth and didn’t belong to any sect, yet he’d ascended to the first position on the Continental Ascensio Rankings of Southbridge Continent for a few tens of years, yet no one was able to shake his position. This itself was a miracle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, Chen Xi rather admired Jiang Zhuliu, yet now that he met Jiang Zhuliu, and especially when Jiang Zhuliu bluntly judged him, Chen Xi naturally couldn’t avoid feeling disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need to pay any attention to him. He’s only a fellow from a poor background that thinks he can bring glory and honor to his ancestors and himself by climbing onto the tree that is the Yin Clan. I’ve seen many disgusting people like this.” Liang Ren spoke with disdain and consoled Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi frowned. “The Yin Clan would probably have to pay a great price to recruit a figure like him, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren laughed with ridicule and revealed greater disdain on his face as he said, “Of course, I heard that so long as he advanced into the Golden Immortal Realm, then Yin Miaomiao will become Dao Companions with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that’s how it is. No wonder he acted in that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he recalled what Jiang Zhuliu said earlier and asked. “What’s the first round of Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was Tie Qiuyu that answered. He thought for a moment before he said, “The recruitment test of Dao Emperor Academy is divided into three rounds. The first round is the simplest, and it’s a test of one’s rankings on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings. Those that aren’t ranked within the top thousand positions will be eliminated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, he glanced at Chen Xi and said, “Presently, your current ranking on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings is the 999</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position, and it’s the easiest to be eliminated. After all, top figures from places like the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, Phoenix Clan, and so on and so forth are participating in Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeming to feel that Tie Qiuyu’s explanation wasn’t clear enough, Liang Ren interrupted and said, “Those powers that came from outside the Immortal Dimension haven’t participated in the rankings on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings. However, during the first round of Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test, they’ll be allowed to be tested before the floating wall of light along with us. In this way, a portion of the existences that are currently ranked in the top thousand positions on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings will definitely be pushed down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished listening to all of this, Chen Xi quickly came to an understanding, and he couldn’t help but smile as he said, “Aren’t they seizing the quota that belongs to our Immortal Dimension?”&nbsp;</span></p>
