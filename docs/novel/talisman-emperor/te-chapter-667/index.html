There were people that perished from time to time, and the scene was horrifying and bloody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also some experts that hadn’t stepped foot into the battlefield, and they avoided it from far away in the surroundings. They were looking for an opportune moment to make a move because they’d similarly discerned that if they were to charge over rashly, then they would surely share the same fate of those that had entered the battlefield before them and fall to their doom.</span></p>

Unfortunately, the army of bronze ants that covered the heavens and the earth and the bloody baleful qi that suffused the entire world was an extreme headache that they didn’t know how to overcome.</span></p>

That’s…” Suddenly, someone spoke out with surprise and bewilderment, and he revealed an expression of disbelief.</span></p>

They seemed as if they’d seen a ghost.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those terrifying divine ants whose ancestors had once devoured gods simply seemed as if they were respectfully greeting the arrival of a king, and they were extraordinarily meek and didn’t seem ferocious at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too strange!</span></p>

Even the Primeval God Devourer Ants had moved aside successively and didn’t dare obstruct his path at all, and it was simply like a miracle was occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked as they knew they’d misjudged earlier. This wasn’t a moth that was darting into the flames, this was obviously a dragon returning to its lair unobstructed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck! Why didn’t I think of doing that?”</span></p>

Once they lost it, they would probably be unable to arrive at the Divine Palace of Creation any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AH!!!” However, before they could even make a move, a string of shrill and miserable cries resounded out. Those experts that were the first to charge out hadn’t even chased up to Chen Xi’s footsteps when they were drowned by the army of bronze ants, and they were instantly transformed into nothingness and vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hiss!” Everyone stopped moving as soon as they saw this scene, and they gasped repeatedly and felt extremely astounded. Never had they imagined that those damnable ants actually seemed as if they could recognize people. They were extremely meek and respected that streak of light as if it was a god, yet once all of them made an appearance, those ants instantly changed completely into their ferocious and ruthless selves, and the ants assaulted them as if they’d killed the parents of the ants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they understood this, besides feeling astounded, everyone felt extremely vexed and dejected.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If we were able to strike up a relationship with that person before this and rely on his strength, then wouldn’t we have been able to easily avoid these damnable ants?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d utterly never imagined that the scene of him charging into the army of bronze ants would actually draw out such thoughts from the hearts of all those experts in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he found out the army of ants was of no threat to him, he’d instantly relaxed and flew with extreme speed, and he flew for the time for an entire half of an incense stick to burn before the scene before his eyes changed instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vast army of bronze ants had vanished and was replaced by a palace. The palace was grand, ancient, and seemed to have been standing in the heavens and the earth for countless years, and it emitted a desolate, heavy, and ancient aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This palace seemed to have been constructed from ancient wood, and its entire body was suffused with expanses of striations and veins that seemed like the rings of an ancient tree, causing it to give others a strange feeling of profoundness and mysteriousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was self-evident that this was surely the most mysterious location in the Creation Sword Domain — The Divine Palace of Creation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to rumor, the mantle and inheritance of that exalted expert from the primeval times was left within the Divine Palace of Creation, and during the countless years until now, it had drawn innumerable great figures to come search for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, not a single person had obtained the inheritance until now, and it caused this place to seem even more mysterious. Many people were guessing exactly what sort of figure would be able to obtain the inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This question had accompanied this palace for countless years until now yet no one was capable of giving a clear and definite answer to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the door to this palace was sealed tightly, and there were actually many people standing outside its doors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t help but feel a wave of surprise because he was clearly aware of exactly how enormous the size of the bronze ant army all along the way was. It was simply like an ocean, and he’d relied on the strand of aura of the Dark Parasol sapling to arrive here safely.</span></p>

So how could this not be shocking?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like I’m not the only one who has something to rely on and those that are capable of arriving here probably have their own secret techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi seemed to be lost in thought. After all, if they were to go head on against the bronze ants, then even an Earthly Immortal Realm expert would probably be trapped to death within the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these people were actually able to arrive here beforehand, so they were surely of extraordinary origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The facts were really as Chen Xi had inferred. When he arrived before the palace and saw the appearances of these people clearly, he was instantly enlightened in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were around forty or fifty experts before the palace. There were beings from the immortal sects, devil sects, and clans from the Primordial Era. All of them were distributed into various different powers and left each other alone, yet faintly formed a confrontational situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, the reason they were able to get along peacefully with each other earlier was that the door to the Divine Palace of Creation hadn’t opened yet, otherwise, it would absolutely be impossible for such a scene to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, Chen Xi saw the figures of the Truth Embrace Sect’s Daoist Crimson Sun, the Heavenflow Dao Sect’s Leng Chan’er, the Heartcontrol Swordhouse’s Wen Daoran, and many others amongst these people. All these three people came from different powers in the 10 great immortal sects, and they respectively stood at different positions. Moreover, they were surrounded by the experts of the power they came from, causing them to seem extremely striking like brilliant moons that were surrounded by a host of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Chen Xi even noticed the figure of Shang Que at the side of the Heartcontrol Swordhouse’s Wen Daoran with a single glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This disciple from the Shang Clan could be considered to be lucky. During the time they were at the Primeval Battlefield, he was saved by an Earthly Immortal Realm expert, and if it wasn’t for that, he’d have died at Chen Xi’s hand since a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides the three immortal sects represented by Daoist Crimson Sun, Leng Chan’er, and Wen Daoran, there were some other experts from the devil sects and clans from the Primordial Era. All of them formed their own circles respectively, and they faintly formed the situation where the immortal sects, devil sects, and primordial clans rivaled each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a scene was actually shockingly similar to the distribution of powers in the Dark Reverie. No matter if it was the 10 great immortal sects, the six lineages of the devil sect, or the primordial clans, all three of these powers were in confrontation with each other from afar and formed a triangle of confrontation. All of them more or less had conflict and competition with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Someone has already entered the Divine Palace of Creation. You have to make the best use of your time because there’s only a single day remaining until the Door of Profundity opens.” The tiny cauldron reminded abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It wouldn’t be those Xeno-race experts that have entered, right?” Chen Xi’s heart shook as he withdrew his gaze that was sizing up the situation in the surrounding. At this moment, he hadn’t approached the Divine Palace of Creation, and he’d restrained his aura while hiding in the extremely distant shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It might be. In short, you have to get ready beforehand because the door to the palace will open again in the time for an incense stick to burn. You must grab this opportunity, otherwise, the next time it opens will be seven days from now, and everything would be too late then,” replied the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, don’t worry. No matter what, I’ll help you obtain that Chaotic Divine Crystal.” Chen Xi took a deep breath and revealed a firm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, he’d transformed into a flowing ray of light that approached the front of the palace. With his current strength, he naturally wouldn’t be afraid of anyone present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak tore through the sky and drew the attention of numerous gazes before the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi! How could it be you?” Leng Chan’er was surprised. Her features were like a painting, her beautiful hair hung loosely like a waterfall, causing her to be charming and sweep like a rose in full bloom, graceful and gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, could it be that I can’t come here?” Chen Xi glanced at Leng Chan’er and replied with a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he’d already descended before the palace and stood there alone, causing him to seem lonely, and he formed a sharp contrast with the experts from the other powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Chan’er was stunned, and then she said with a smile, “I was just slightly surprised.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi glanced at her deeply yet didn’t expose her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d already confirmed one thing through Leng Chan’er’s reaction, she surely knew of the matter of Yan Shisan plotting against him, otherwise, she wouldn’t feel so surprised upon seeing him making an appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s Chen Xi?” At the other side, a clear voice suddenly sounded out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi raised his eyes and looked over. He saw that the person who spoke had eyes that were brilliant like the stars, a face that was white like jade, a high nose, and emitted a vast imposing aura that towered into the sky, and it caused him to seem like a king that had descended here. This person was the peerless sword cultivator from the Heartcontrol Swordhouse, Wen Daoran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. It’s precisely this detestable villain that brutally killed the disciples of my Shang Clan and even the Young Master Shang Kun perished at his hand in the Primeval Battlefield!” At Wen Daoran’s side, Shang Que gnashed his teeth while his eyes were filled with resentment. “Senior Brother Wen, my Young Master Shang Kun is the nephew Ancestor Zi Ming dotes upon the most, you must take revenge for him!”</span></p>
