It transformed into strand after strand of fire element sword qi that sometimes raged like waves, sometimes surged like lava, sometimes transformed into sparks that fluttered about…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the inheritance of the ‘Sword of Fire.’ It explained the supreme profundities of the Law of Fire, and through the changes in talisman markings, they were contained within strands of completely different sword qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his experience from comprehending the Sword of Water, Chen Xi familiarly comprehended the various profundities revealed by the Infinite Divine Talisman in a calm manner while he formed a sword with his fingers and started to practice the Sword of Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of sword qi soared into the sky and transformed into rising divine brilliance that swept throughout the surroundings, and it seemed as if it intended the incinerate the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fireflow Incineration!” This move vividly portrayed the violent and overbearing qualities of the Law of Fire. It carried the imposing aura of incinerating the heavens and boiling the seas with a single strike. It carried the most terrifying might when utilized to crush one’s enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long period of time, Chen Xi’s fingers moved, and another strand of sword tore through space as it emerged. It was like a rain of fire covered the sky as it poured down from the sky. Every single strand of flames revealed an accurate, sharp, and extremely blazing imposing aura. As the myriad of strands of flaming rain sprayed down, it was like a myriad of extremely blazing strands of sword light tearing through the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Flaming Rainveil!” This move revealed the unrestrained and arrogant aura impetus of the Laws of fire. It was like a rain of sword spraying down, and its lethality was the most shocking when utilized in a group battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with the passage of time, Chen Xi’s comprehension of the Sword of Fire grew more and more numerous. His entire body seemed to have transformed into that of a god of flames, and his entire body emanated the energy of the Laws of fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an unknown period of time, Chen Xi moved once more. He lifted his finger in a slow and serious manner. It was as if he was dragging up the weight of a mountain, and it drew a heavy arc in space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, it seemed like a divine thunderclap resounded. With Chen Xi as the center, a myriad of enormous waves of lava surged out from all directions, and they enveloped the heavens and the earth and caused it to seem as if he resided within a kingdom of surging flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single wave of flame was extraordinarily powerful and heavy. It revealed a terrifying aura of crushing and incinerating everything in the heavens and the earth. &nbsp;It was like a bladeless heavy sword that carried a hidden sharpness of its own, and it destroyed everything with might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sea of Flames Purgatory!” At this moment, Chen Xi suddenly opened his eyes from his comprehension before sitting down cross-legged, and then he started to absorb and understand the inheritances he’d obtained earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fireflow Incineration, Flaming Rainveil, and Sea of Flames Purgatory… These three moves were just like the three moves of the Sword of Water, and they formed the complete inheritance of the Sword of Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the Sword of Water that was all pervasive and accommodated everything, the Sword of Fire was obviously even more violent, overbearing, and unrestrained.</span></p>

The existence of fire was one that blazed as soon as it was lit, and it was wild and unrestrained to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi remained in closed door cultivation within the world of stars, and over a month had passed without him noticing, whereas around seven days had passed in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period of time, Chen Xi’s name had spread throughout the academy at shocking speak. It wasn’t just the outer court, even many people within the Pill Reserve, Scripture Reserve, and Dao Development Reserve were constantly talking about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The inner court head instructor, Xuanyuan Pojun, openly declared that he would fully support the first amongst the new students, Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I heard that fellow helped the Xuanyuan Clan greatly. It isn’t just that, even all the seniors of the Pill Reserve greatly favor that kid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that as well. It seems to be related to the assignment on restoring the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron. That day, the sound of a cauldron shook the heavens from within the Pill Reserve, and it was heard clearly by many instructors and students.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unfortunately, even until today, I’m unable to determine if the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron was restored by Chen Xi or not. All the seniors of the Pill Reserve refuse to mention this matter. But I think that even if that Chen Xi wasn’t the one that managed the restoration of the cauldron, it’s probably closely related to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amazing! The first amongst the new students this year just entered the academy, yet has caused such a commotion. It probably won’t be long before someone will invite him to the Dao Development Reserve to discuss the Dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dao Development Reserve? Oh, Haha! Right, every single new student that enters the academy will be invited to the Dao Development Reserve to receive a test in the discussion of the Dao. Haha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Discussions like these continued indefinitely, whereas Chen Xi’s name was known very well by numerous students and instructors through these various discussions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It couldn’t be said to be like a scorching sun in the midday sky, but at the very least, he was considered a figure with a striking reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Chen Xi remained in closed door cultivation, within the hall where the outer court’s Enforcement Hall resided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, we have to repress Chen Xi…” Zuoqiu Jun frowned and muttered while putting down the jade slip in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The jade slip was sent over by one of the head instructors in the Pill Reserve, Zuoqiu Sheng. It explicitly described what Chen Xi had done in the Pill Reserve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kid is really troublesome. He has only entered the academy for less than a month, yet he relied on the opportunity of restoring the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron to obtain the favor of all the seniors in the Pill Reserve and the Xuanyuan Clan in one go. If this is to continue, then he’ll probably grow successfully. At that time, it’ll probably be extremely difficult to deal with him.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Uncle Zuoqiu Hong has already decided to prohibit us from making a move against Chen Xi before the inner court exam. If I want to repress him at this moment, then I’ll probably have to utilize some other methods.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun swiftly pondered exactly what move he should make in order to repress Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Jun, is something weighing down on your mind?” It wasn’t just Zuoqiu Jun who was within the hall, and the other students of the Enforcement Hall were present here as well. The person that spoke was a pretty woman who possessed a hot figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had beautiful eyes and a pink complexion, and she was rather beautiful. Unfortunately, her lips were thin while her cheekbones were rather high, causing her bearing to become slightly gloomy and vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman was called Liu Yiming. She was at the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm in cultivation, and she was a senior student as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her surname wasn’t originally Liu, and she’d changed her surname to Liu after she became Dao Companions with Liu Zefeng that was the 8</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;on the Allheaven Golden Rankings. Her actions had once been denounced and regarded as shameful by the students of the outer court. They mocked her for trying to curry favor with the powerful and lacking any backbone whatsoever. But Liu Yiming took pride in it, and she didn’t care about all this gossip at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun had a flash of inspiration in his heart when he heard Liu Yiming speak, and he said, “Junior Sister Yiming, you’ve already stayed at the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm for almost four hundred years now, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming was stunned, and she had a slightly displeased expression as she said, “Senior Brother Jun, what do you mean by this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun smiled and said, “Don’t take it personally. I just suddenly thought of something and want to trouble you with it. If you’re able to accomplish it, then I’ll give you a Nine Profundity Clarity Divine Pill to help you charge into the Golden Immortal Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very well aware of Liu Yiming’s disposition. She was extremely snobbish to the bone and placed the most importance on benefit. So long as there were sufficient benefits, then not to mention making her change her surname, even betraying Liu Zefeng was an extremely easy task for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, if was precisely because she was Liu Zefeng’s Dao Companion that Zuoqiu Jun had brought her into the Enforcement Hall in an effort to rope Liu Zefeng in. Otherwise, it was utterly impossible for her to enter Zuoqiu Jun’s gaze with by relying merely on her cultivation at the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, when she heard the words Nine Aperture Clarity Divine Pills, Liu Yiming’s eyes instantly lit up while she beamed. She said, “What does Senior Brother Jun require of me? So long as Junior Sister is able to help, then I’ll definitely not hesitate to agree.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she even secretly gave Zuoqiu Jun a charming glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun sneered in his heart and felt extremely contemptuous. Yet he said instead, “The matter is very simple. I heard that Junior Sister has a vast network of friends, and you know many experts in our outer court. I want to ask you to…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before long, Zuoqiu Jun had told her of his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Invite Chen Xi to the Dao Development Reserve to discuss the Dao?” After she finished listening to him, Liu Yiming obviously started to hesitate. Even though she was snobbish, she wasn’t an idiot. In these past few days, she’d heard many rumors about Chen Xi as well. So, when she heard that Zuoqiu Jun actually wanted to rely on her to deal with Chen Xi, she was slightly hesitant in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly. Junior Sister Yiming, you’re clearly aware as well that there’s an unspoken rule in our academy. After the new students entered the academy, they’ll be taught a lesson at the Dao Development Reserve. It’s only a spar and not murder.” Zuoqiu Jun said frankly, “Doing this is also for the sake of rubbing off their pride. After all, all these new students were peerless geniuses in the past, and they’re proud and conceited. The battle at the Dao Development Reserve is also able to clear their minds and allow them to understand that there’s always someone more powerful in the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, he smiled as he looked at Liu Yiming and said, “I wonder if Junior Sister Yiming is interested in clearing up the mind of the first amongst the new students and allow him to understand that he’s only ordinary in the entire academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m naturally very interested.” Liu Yiming said hesitantly, “But I want to know why Senior Brother Jun refuses to take action yourself and chose me instead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun shrugged and said, “Even you’re aware that the entire academy knows that there’s enmity between that kid and my Zuoqiu Clan. As the head student of the Enforcement Hall, it would be slightly improper for me to go deal with him myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He paused for a moment and continued. “Not to mention that if it’s in terms of networking, then amongst the eight thousand students of the outer court, Junior Sister Yiming is the best. So I can be rather at ease with you handling this matter. Of course, no matter if this matter is accomplished successfully or not, I’ll give Junior Sister a Nine Aperture Clarity Divine Pill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming was obviously moved. She pondered deeply for a long time before she said, “Chen Xi’s the first amongst the new students, and his combat strength during the second round of the test was outstanding as well. Amongst his peers, there are probably very few that can defeat him after inviting him to the Dao Development Reserve, whereas even though I know many students…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun understood what she meant before she could finish speaking, and he interrupted her with a wave of his hand. “You don’t have to worry about this, Junior Sister. Besides you, I believe that many others will make a move as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The meaning behind his words were that he didn’t arrange for only her to do this, and she didn’t have to worry about the candidates to deal with Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yiming instantly felt very much at ease when she heard this, and she immediately stood up before smiling charmingly. “Since Senior Brother Jun has planned so well, it would truly be inexcusable if Junior Sister continued to refuse. I’ll go investigate Chen Xi right now, and I’ll think of a way to force him to accept the invitation and head to the Dao Development Reserve to discuss the Dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she’d turned around and left swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, I’m still not fully free of worry towards your methods…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched Liu Yiming leave, Zuoqiu Jun’s smile was gradually restrained, and he once again recovered his gloomy and indifferent appearance.</span></p>
