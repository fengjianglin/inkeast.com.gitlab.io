 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Even though gales still wreaked havoc and the muddy waves still surged, yet the oppressive aura from before was gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, numerous pitch black buildings actually stood towering on the numerous islands at the frontmost, and Chen Xi was able to frequently notice numerous experts moving through these buildings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Chen Xi’s discerning gaze, he noticed the numerous islands formed a fan shape, and they were jointly protecting a passageway behind them. According to what Ren Changfeng said, this was probably Myriad Star Passageway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only by entering Myriad Star Passageway would one be able to arrive at the other side of the Sea of Misery, and this was the one and only path in the hands of the various great powers of the Netherworld up until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps there were other passageways that led to the other side of the Sea of Misery in different areas of the sea, but they were mostly unknown areas that were filled with a great deal of danger and temporal storms, so no one dared to risk their lives.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Myriad Star Passageway was the only and only path that connected the Six Path Royal Region and the Kings of Hell Region, and it had always been firmly held in the hands of the Second King of Hell, King Chu Jiang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, if one intended to enter the Myriad Star Passageway, then a large amount of Nether Crystals had to be paid according to the amount of people that were seeking passage. Only in this way would the Jiang Soulguards that guarded the sides of the Myriad Star Passageway let one pass through the passageway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Jiang Soulguards were a group of troops under King Chu Jiang’s command. Every single Jiang Soulguard possessed a cultivation comparable to the fifth level of the Earthly Immortal Realm, and some formidable soulguards were even peak sovereigns at the Earthly Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was the center of the Sea of Misery, so one’s ability to stand on guard here while remaining safe and sound was a sign of strength because an ordinary figure was absolutely unable to survive here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! No matter if it’s your Wei Clan or any other Clan, no one is allowed to enter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, why is that so? Wasn’t only one hundred Nether Crystal per person required in the past to pass through the passageway?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the order of my Lord. This place has been sealed off since seven days ago, and no one is allowed to step foot into the passageway. If anyone dares to trespass, then we’ll kill without mercy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“King Chu Jiang!?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wave of clamorous noise sounded out from afar. It turned out that a fleet of vessels intended to pass through the Myriad Star Passageway, yet they were obstructed by a group of Jiang Soulguards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed when he saw this, and he stopped the treasured vessel as he said, “The situation seems to be bad. Let’s observe the situation first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fleet of vessels was rather huge, and there were eighteen treasured vessels amongst them. All of these vessels were luxurious, elegant, and suffused with a shocking aura of treasures. They were clearly not something an ordinary power could possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a fleet from such a great power had been obstructed outside the Myriad Star Passageway now, and this was very unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Ling nodded. She’d heard the conversation between the two parties as well, and it seemed like King Chu Jiang had ordered that the Myriad Star Passageway was completely sealed off and no one was allowed to enter it. This was slightly unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Myriad Star Passageway was the one and only path that connected the Six Path Royal Region and the Kings of Hell Region, yet King Chu Jiang had actually sealed it off just like that.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that he’s not worried about offending the other great powers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There’s surely a reason behind this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, my Young Master and Young Miss must arrive at the Kings of Hell Region within ten days to participate in the disciple recruitment test of the Sixth King of Hell, King Bian Cheng, that’s held once every one hundred years. This sort of opportunity only occurs once in a blue moon and can’t be missed. I hope you can make an exception, and my Wei Clan will surely repay you generously in the future.” An old man in embroidered robes stood before the fleet as he spoke in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he withdrew a storage pouch and passed it over in an imperceptible manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing opposite the old man was a middle aged man with a ruthless and rough appearance. He wore a scarlet red cape and emanated a ferocious imposing aura that carried an oppressive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the meaning of this?” The ruthless middle aged man frowned as he pushed the old man’s hand aside, and he grunted coldly. “Do you know that my Lord has given an inviolable command this time, and all the guards in the entire second hall have been deployed to set up layer after layer of barriers. No matter how abundant the wealth in your possession is, how many people can it bribe?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he spoke in a grim voice, he’d warned them secretly through this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression of the old man turned to shock as he said, “May I ask who offended King Chu Jiang to the point of actually deploying such forces?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he passed over the storage pouch for a second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the ruthless middle aged man didn’t refuse, and he received it with a raise of his hand before his expression instantly eased up greatly after he sized up the contents of the storage pouch. “Out of respect for your Wei Clan, it’s fine to tell you that some time ago, my Lord captured a woman from the Mortal Dimension for the sake of helping a friend of his from the Immortal Dimension. But I heard that someone would be coming to rescue that woman soon…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man instantly came to an understanding when he heard such an explanation, and he couldn’t help but speak with surprise. “Could it be that the opponent is extremely formidable? The Myriad Star Passageway actually has to be sealed off to deal with him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know if he’s formidable or not, my orders are to seal off this place and prohibit anyone from entering.” When he spoke up to here, the ruthless middle aged man waved his hand and said, “All of you can leave. Perhaps you’ll be able to pass through after we’ve captured that enemy. But at this moment, it’s absolutely impossible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man stared blankly as he fell into deep contemplation for a short period of time, and then he turned around and walked into the vessel. He seemed to intend to report this matter to the Wei Clan’s Young Master and Young Miss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t long before the fleet slowly withdrew from the Myriad Star Passageway, but it didn’t leave and stopped at the side instead. It seemed to intend to wait for a while and find an opportunity to obtain passage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ruthless middle aged man couldn’t help but grunt coldly when he saw this, and he shook his head without end. “How unfortunate! These people are members of the Human Path’s Wei Clan and are extremely wealthy, yet I was unable to take a good slice of it. What a pity…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Chen Xi noticed all of this, and he smiled calmly. “Looks like that King Chu Jiang is already clearly aware that I’m coming, and he deployed such a battle array. It truly makes me feel slightly overwhelmed from this sudden favor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Ling wasn’t able to bring herself to smile instead, and she said with a frown, “The Myriad Star Passageway has been sealed off. What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very simple. We’ll charge over directly.” Chen Xi said indifferently, “At this moment, there’s already no need to conceal our tracks, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Ling nodded while her clear eyes were filled with killing intent, and she said, “This is our only choice indeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

However, his face was covered in rage. Obviously, he still didn’t know how to conceal his feelings.</span></p>

She was elegant and graceful while her gaze was deep and flickered with the sheen of wisdom. She was beautiful in appearance and clever in mind.</span></p>

He was the seventh son of the patriarch. The young woman was called Wei Lan, and she was Wen Xiaofeng’s older sister.</span></p>

Truly damnable! Who does King Chu Jiang think he is to not even give face to our Human Path? He’s simply going too far!” Wen Xiaofeng cried out with rage.</span></p>

If he’s determined to seal off the Myriad Star Passageway, then we’re unable to go through forcefully as well.” The old man in embroidered robes laughed bitterly as he consoled. “In my opinion, perhaps a turn for the better will appear if we wait for a few days. After all, it isn’t just our Wei Clan’s group that’s travelling up and down the Myriad Star Passageway every single day. King Chu Jiang’s actions of sealing off this place will surely arouse the anger of the public. Perhaps we’ll be able to take advantage of the situation and pass through.”</span></p>

How could it compare with our Wei Clan? Even we’ve stopped, so how could they have the courage to move forward rashly? Big Sister, it’s not that I’m intentionally talking bad about you, but don’t compare our Wei Clan with trash like this so as to avoid elevating their position instead.”</span></p>

Could it be that the people on the vessel are looking to die?”</span></p>

Sure enough, they saw that vessel was directly charging towards the Myriad Star Passageway, and they couldn’t help but frown at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that the person on that vessel is a rash idiot?</span></p>

The man was handsome and tall while the woman was cold like ice. They utterly didn’t make any inquiries, nor did they give those Jiang Soulguards the opportunity to obstruct them before they actually started a slaughter!</span></p>

A wave of his hand emanated a myriad of strands of brilliance that illuminated the heavens and the earth, and it instantly annihilated over ten Jiang Soulguards, causing blood to spray into the sky while shrill cries echoed through the heavens.</span></p>

It’s only a treasured vessel that’s overestimating its ability and courting death! What’s there to get surprised…?” The young man, Wen Xiaofeng, charged out and muttered with a rather displeased tone. However, he hadn’t finished speaking when he was stunned on the spot, and his eyes were wide open while his jaw almost fell to the ground.</span></p>
