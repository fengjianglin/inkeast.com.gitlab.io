 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His footsteps emitted heavy, muffled, and rhythmic sounds as he stepped up into the sky, and they resounded out in the heavens and the earth like the sound of a drum. Moreover, they seemed to have a magical effect that caused everything in the heavens and the earth to fall into silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The army of specters that were everywhere fell into a stunned state, and they forgot to attack, whereas the hearts of the extremely sorrowful cultivators in the city became calm along with the resounding of these footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, the Ghost Emperor Li Huang, Luo Chuan, Ming Zhi, and Lu Gang’s gazes abruptly became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this expanse of silence, Chen Xi held the jade cauldron as he ascended up into the sky. His figure was tall and carried a lofty and steady bearing as if he was a king that established the world and made everything submit before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who’re you?” The Ghost Emperor Li Huang shouted loudly, and his silver pupils were filled with a surprised and bewildered expression. In his eyes, the imposing aura emitted by Chen Xi who held the jade cauldron was extremely alike to the terrifying existence in the primeval times that had once caused him to have countless nightmares.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the others jolted awake from their silence, and they looked towards the tall figure in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi!?” Feng Jianbai, Su Qingyan, Xue Ranchen, and the others within the city were stunned, and an expression of disbelief gushed out from their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why is it this fellow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how formidable he is, he only possesses a cultivation at the Rebirth Realm! How could he possibly achieve this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait, he isn’t Chen Xi.” Qing Xiuyi, Zhen Liuqing, Huangfu Qingying, and the other disciples of the Darchu Dynasty revealed surprised and bewildered expressions after being slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person’s appearance was indeed Chen Xi’s without a doubt. However, that bearing was completely different to Chen Xi, and he had an extremely steady and respected aura of a king.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze was sedate and calm, and everywhere his gaze reached, it seemed as if the heavens and the earth had become silent and the entire world had become calm and meek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if so long he was present, everything in the world had something to rely on, something to entrust their hopes to, and this imposing aura of ruling over the entire world belonged to the aura of a supreme king that dominated the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What exactly has occurred to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was unable to guess it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, a wisp of deep-rooted hatred gushed out from Bing Shitian’s heart when he saw Chen Xi, and the flames of envy that were originally suppressed in the depths of his heart once again started surging up slowly into his heart, causing him to wish for nothing more than to annihilate this kid before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An existence that’s like an ant actually obtained the heart of Senior Sister, and she even gave birth to a son for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an outcome that Bing Shitian was utterly unable to accept, nor could he tolerate it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Senior Sister was an inviolable existence in his heart and belonged only to him. Besides him, there wasn’t a single person in this world that could obtain her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So Bing Shitian had long since held killing intent towards Chen Xi, but he’d endured it all this time and intended to find an optimum opportunity to annihilate Chen Xi in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he never expected that Chen Xi would actually appear at a time like this. Moreover, Chen Xi had appeared with such a steady and vast imposing aura, causing him to simply be in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could a tiny ant possess such a formidable imposing aura? It’s even…stronger than mine!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of feeling caused Bing Shitian to feel extreme detest and discomfort. Presently, he’d already been beaten to the point of being bathed in blood, severely injured, was in a sorry state, and he was powerless to turn the situation around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as soon as Chen Xi appeared, he caused everyone to be shocked and caused the heavens and the earth to be shaken. How could Bing Shitian, who’d always boasted of his identity as a Heavenly Immortal, be able to accept such an enormous gap?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he still endured it in the end. He wanted to see whether this fellow was actually making a false show of strength. Or perhaps it could be said that he utterly didn’t believe that Chen Xi’s appearance could change anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The cause is the jade cauldron in his hand!” Madman Liu frowned as his muddy eyes stared fixedly at the jade cauldron in Chen Xi’s hand, and the shock in his heart grew the longer he looked at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a jade cauldron that was completely crystalline and smooth like jade, divine lights flowed around it as divinity flickered upon it, and the surroundings of the cauldron had a thousand rays of light and a myriad of strands of auspicious qi revolving around it. Besides that, talisman markings surged on it as the sound of gods chanting faintly emanated from it, and it possessed a vast, lofty, and all-encompassing aura of supremacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, regretfully, there was a gap at the mouth of the cauldron, causing its flawlessness to have a bit of flaw. But even then, this jade cauldron was still formidable to the extreme, and it caused others to be utterly unable to estimate exactly what level of treasure it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just Madman Liu, some others with formidable strengths had noticed the jade cauldron in Chen Xi’s hand, and all of them were exceedingly shocked as they felt this treasure actually seemed to be much more formidable than the weapons of the gods!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This cauldron…” The Ghost Emperor Li Huang as a wisp of reminiscence was revealed from his silver pupils, and he seemed to have recalled something, yet didn’t dare believe it was true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’re you hesitating for? Kill him first! With the strength of the four of us, even if the gods are revived, what can they do to us?” Luo Chuan shouted out explosively as he launched an attack first. His pure white wings flapped, causing him to seem like a flowing light as a myriad of bright silver lights sprayed out explosively before condensing into a scissors that struck towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The revival of the gods…” High above in the sky, Chen Xi suddenly muttered with a voice that revealed boundless ancientness, sorrow, and grief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, his gaze swept towards Luo Chuan’s attack that struck towards him, and he lightly spat out two words. “Fuck off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked as the jade cauldron in Chen Xi’s hand charged out and shattered the bright silver scissors right away, causing silver lights to scatter in the sky and dissipate into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the jade cauldron didn’t lose momentum in the slightest and seemed to tear through space as it arrived before Luo Chuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It smashed onto Luo Chuan before a crack resounded out, and then Luo Chuan’s pure white wings were broken off, causing silver and thick blood to gush out explosively while his entire body was blasted flying while endlessly coughing up blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had expected that Chen Xi was actually so dominating and terrifying. Merely a single strike of his had heavily injured a Xeno-race expert that had descended to the Primeval Battlefield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of strength is this? What sort of might is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, a trace of flames of hope burned once again in the originally despairing hearts of everyone within the city, and everyone faintly felt that Chen Xi’s appearance was bound to turn the situation around!</span></p>

The others didn’t know Luo Chuan’s strength, yet they knew it clearly, and even if a true Heavenly Immortal descended here, the Heavenly Immortal would be utterly incapable of heavily injuring Luo Chuan with a single strike!</span></p>

You actually injured me, fight me again!” Luo Chuan howled. He was extremely furious, as he’d actually been heavily injured with a single strike earlier, and even though he’d already recovered his injuries, it was still an enormous humiliation to him.</span></p>

The gods can’t revive themselves any longer…” When faced with this exceedingly terrifying attack, Chen Xi seemed as if he was unaware of it, he sighed in a low voice before suddenly shaking his head forcefully, and he emitted a low and sorrowful howl as his long hair started fluttering.</span></p>

It was impossible for the gods to be revived, yet there were still surviving Xeno-race experts that had come to invade, and this caused him to be filled with hatred and killing intent.</span></p>

Countless bright stars flickered as an extremely long river of stars appeared, and it illuminated his body while his body revealed apertures that conformed to the river of stars. At this moment, he and the heavens and the earth cast light upon each other, and they conformed extremely to each other.</span></p>

Chen Xi’s eyes carried frightening killing intent while the jade cauldron seemed like a divine sun as countless ancient and vast talisman markings gushed out from it and smashed down. As it collided left and right, Luo Chuan, Meng Zhi, and Lu Gang were successively struck to the point of retreating repeatedly while coughing blood endlessly, and their entire bodies were tainted red with blood.</span></p>
