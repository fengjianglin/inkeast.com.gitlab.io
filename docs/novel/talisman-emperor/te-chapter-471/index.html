Wind and fire howled while his golden core emitted an extremely dazzling and brilliant glow, and it even faintly showed signs of melting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark clouds in the sky above him roiled as crimson red bolts of lightning danced about violently, and the golden core within his body was blazing with flames as if it was being incinerated.</span></p>

So long as the Soul Core remained intact, the cultivator’s life would never fade away, and even if the cultivator’s body was destroyed, the body of another could be seized to achieve rebirth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But overcoming the dual Rebirth Tribulations wasn’t an easy thing. Conversely, the Rebirth Tribulations were extremely dangerous, and the slightest carelessness would possibly cause one’s Dao Foundation and soul to be incinerated by the tribulation flames, while one’s body would be struck apart by the tribulation lightning, causing it to be extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simply speaking, when one tried to overcome the Rebirth Tribulation, one would either be reborn and undergo a transformation or be obliterated directly and perish completely.

But he couldn’t care about all this at this moment, because the siege of the numerous experts had already covered the heavens and the earth and struck towards him.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

It was sufficient to destroy a city or stronghold, crush a mountain or river, and its impetus was terrifying to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break apart!” Chen Xi’s entire body was burning as his being was like a furnace that was blazing extremely exuberantly, and the Flaming Peacock Fan in his hand swept out to explode out with flames that shot into the sky. He possessed an imposing aura as if he was able to slaughter a great number while facing a powerful army, and his killing intent charged into the sky.</span></p>

Otherwise, how could it possess the might to destroy a city or stronghold and crush a mountain or river? Yet now, everything was obstructed and was shattered into powder and incinerated into nothingness by the monstrous sea of lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the experts in the distance revealed shocked expressions.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi is really shocking. Even if he’s facing the dual tribulations of Rebirth, he’s still able to explode out with such a terrifying might. If he’s able to successfully overcome the tribulation, then exactly how terrifying would his strength become?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We absolutely can’t allow him to succeed!” Pei Yu cried out loudly and seemed to be in a state of madness. He’d already wasted a Heavenly Immortal’s Decree, yet was still unable to annihilate Chen Xi. If Chen Xi was allowed to successfully overcome the tribulation, then their lives would probably be accompanied by nightmares forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would absolutely not allow that situation to occur, nor could he accept such a situation occurring, as just thinking about it caused him to feel terrified.</span></p>

This was a seal, the Quasi Immortal Artifact of Qin Xiao, and it was called Mountainform Seal. At this moment, the seal had formed into a mountain the surged with talisman markings while rosy clouds rose from it. There were luxuriant ancient trees and enormous vines standing tall on it, and there were even various beasts flying and moving about on it. It was filled with vitality and vividly revealed the vast aura that belonged to a Quasi Immortal Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This enormous seal smashed down while filled with vitality, causing it to seem like a true mountain world smashing down, and it emitted a terrifying aura and a myriad of auspicious rays of light as it moved to crush Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, Qin Xiao had perceived as well that if they didn’t annihilate Chen Xi now, they wouldn’t have another chance in the future. So he didn’t hesitate in the slightest to utilize his Quasi Immortal Artifact, the Mountainform Seal, with the hope of completely stopping Chen Xi’s footsteps that moved towards the Rebirth Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break apart!” Chen Xi’s gaze were like bolts of lightning as he roared loudly, and the jet black hair that covered his head stood on end as the vital energy in his entire body surged, causing him to emit a majestic and powerful imposing aura and the spirit of looking down on all beings in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The mountains and rocks transformed into powder as the ancient trees turned to ash, and everything exploded apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flaming Peacock Fan was a Quasi Immortal Artifact as well. When utilized in the hands of Chen Xi, the might it revealed was countless times stronger than when it was utilized by Xu Lengye, and it directly blasted Qin Xiao’s Mountainform Seal flying. Moreover, the surface of the Mountainform Seal became dim and lusterless, and it simply seemed too weak to go against Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was extremely shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s too strong. Two Quasi Immortal Artifacts collided with each other, yet Qin Xiao obviously seems to have fallen into a disadvantaged position, and it’s even to the extent then he isn’t able to go against a single move of Chen Xi’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmm?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was just about to seize this opportunity to charge and slaughter when he suddenly sensed that something was off. The golden core in his body emitted crackling sounds as it shook violently, and it was actually burned by the tribulation flames to the point it was on the verge of transforming into liquid and evaporating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He originally intended to wait for when both the Rebirth Tribulations descended to rely on the energy of slaughter to resist the tribulation flames. However, the tribulation lightning in the sky hadn’t descended, yet the tribulation flames here had suddenly become violent instead. This suddenly change of events forced him to have no choice but to divert his attention and suppress the tribulation flames within his entire strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So everyone saw a strange scene. Chen Xi’s body was raging with tribulation flames, yet the sky above him was covered in dark clouds that surged with crimson bolts of lightning, but not a strand of tribulation lightning descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How strange. Look, the tribulation lightning Chen Xi drew over has actually formed into an army of lightning weapons, and it has transformed into lightning pikes, lightning swords, lightning spears, lightning halberds…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My god! It can’t be, right? I heard that the stronger one’s strength was when overcoming the tribulation, the more terrifying the tribulation lightning one would encounter. This tribulation lightning this fellow drew out has actually transformed into various lightning weapons. Doesn’t this mean that this fellow’s strength is already strong to the point of being capable of looking down on everyone, otherwise how could he possibly give rise to such a terrifying tribulation lightning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed. The tribulation lightning is capable of sensing the strength of a cultivator before sending down a tribulation lightning that’s sufficient to kill the cultivator. Now, this tribulation lightning is so vast, and it’s obviously because Chen Xi’s strength is too formidable and caused such a shocking change to occur in it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of all the spectators in the distance shuddered when they saw this time, and then they moved back. Most of them were about to advance to the Rebirth Realm, and they were deeply afraid that the aura of Chen Xi’s tribulation would affect their own, as they’d be helpless once their own tribulations were drawn over.</span></p>

The tribulation flames have already started to incinerate his golden core, so we’ll seize this opportunity to reap his life!” The group of people shouted out furiously as they went all out and risked their lives against Chen Xi.</span></p>

Even though it hadn’t descended for a long time, the destructive force emitted by it that intended to annihilate everything was sufficient to collapse one’s fighting spirit and cause the guard around one’s mind to crumble.</span></p>

His golden core was about to be destroyed, his Dao Foundation about to collapse, yet he seemed as if he didn’t notice in the slightest, and his expression was calm and indifferent as before while he stepped forward.</span></p>

Someone stopped Chen Xi!” Everyone in the distance was shocked, and they stared their eyes wide open as they looked over.

This woman hadn’t made a move since the beginning, yet had chosen to make a move at this moment. Obviously, she’d perceived that he was already on the verge of suffering the tribulation, and she intended to complexly exterminate him.</span></p>

But all of them were extremely formidable. For example, Bi Lingyun, Qin Xiao, Pei Yu, Wei Kong, Cheng Feng, and the various other genius experts that had come from first-rate Dynasties, the Darxuan and Darqian Dynasties.</span></p>

This strike was extremely terrifying and seemed capable of collapsing the heavens and shattering the earth.</span></p>
