 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He summoned the disciple that brought the news into the secret chamber before asking in detail, and he heaved a sigh of relief when he obtained the answer. The person that had come was only a young man. Even though the young man was from the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, so long as it wasn’t a figure from the higher-ups of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, then it was possible to turn the matter around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect?” The nearby second demon Yin Xiong spoke out abruptly, and his eyes were suffused with a wisp of a strange radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other demons had slightly strange expressions as well, and it was difficult to ascertain what they were thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do all of you plan to do! Do all of you still want to eat him as well!?” Wu Zhichong’s expression sank instantly, and it was extremely unsightly as he roared in a low voice. “I’m warning all of you. If you spoil the important matters of the Heavenflow Dao Sect, then not to mention me, all of you won’t be able to escape as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then Sect Master Wu, what do you intend to do? He has already come to your front door, yet you’re going to sit here helplessly and wait for death to arrive?” Yin Xiong laughed gloomily as he said unhurriedly, “How about we brothers help you annihilate this great enemy? Don’t worry, not to mention the Heavenflow Dao Sect, even if the Nine Radiance Sword Sect seeks revenge, we brothers will bear it. How about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Wu Zhichong’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and he started to hesitate in his heart. He knew more clearly than anyone else about what sort of matter he was handling right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few days ago, he’d received the jade slip message from a great figure in the Nine Radiance Sect. At the same time, he’d also received an order from the Heavenflow Dao Sect. Both of these requested that he must capture a Nine Radiance Sword Sect disciple called Qing Yu before using this person as a hostage to deal with a young man called Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, that person called Qing Yu had already been captured, yet had been eaten by these damnable demons before him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This simply caused Wu Zhichong to not know how to give those great figures an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he was only the Sect Master of a second-rate sect. No matter if it was to the Heavenflow Dao Sect or the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, killing him was simply even easier than crushing an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So when he heard these demon cultivators strike their chests and guarantee to bear all the consequences, he was really moved greatly. In other words, even if those great figures were to seek to punish him, he could put all the dirt on the seven dark pheasant demons, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you found out exactly what’s the name of the young man that trespassed into my Violetwind Sect?” Wu Zhichong suddenly thought of something, and he asked the disciple that stood respectfully at the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know.”</span></p>

Why has this young disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect not headed over to the Pheasant God Ridge to look for trouble with the seven dark pheasant demons, but has come to the territory of my Violetwind Sect to cause trouble instead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be…that this young man has already guessed that it was I who schemed against his Senior Brother Qing Yu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Zhichong’s heart went cold when he thought up to here. He knew that if news of this were to spread to the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, then his entire Violetwind Sect would probably be drowned by the flames of rage of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I don’t see my Senior Brother Qing Yu after three breaths of time passes, then bear the consequences!” A voice that was indifferent like ice and spread through the layer upon layer of defenses on the secret chamber and entered it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Zhichong’s face went grim. “He actually dares to be so presumptuous! Since he dares to act like this in the territory of my Violetwind Sect, the person that has come is absolutely not someone ordinary!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the secret chamber shook as if a great earthquake had occurred in the distance, and the aftershock and rumbling stretched out over here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rumbling was like a sledgehammer than smashed onto Wu Zhichong’s heart, causing him to be unable to refrain from being slightly furious and doubtful.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who exactly is that young man? He actually dares to be so arrogant! Could it be that he’s one of the five great Elite Disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master Wu, what’re you still hesitating for? The enemy has already arrived at your doorstep, and if you don’t deal with him now, then it will be too late once news gets out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, we brothers will make a move together and deal with this disaster for Sect Master Wu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These demons of the Pheasant God Ridge stood up one by one and glanced at each other before a wisp of a strange smile emerged on the corners of their mouth. After that, they charged directly out of the secret chamber and actually disregarded whether Wu Zhichong agreed or not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Allowing these bastards to make a move is good as well. I’ll let them probe that young man first, and if they’re really incapable…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five of them had just left when Wu Zhichong had suddenly calmed down and became composed, and his eyes were suffused with a wisp of resolute killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stood with his hands behind his back before the Violetwind Sect that was covered in ruins. His clothes fluttered with the wind while his back remained straight like a spear, and even though he was all alone, he was like a lofty and large mountain that emitted an unshakable and oppressive aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the disciples of the Violetwind Sect looked at this young man that had suddenly trespassed into their sect with horror in their eyes, and they kept silent as cicadas in the winter while none of them dared to come forward and offend Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenes from before had truly scared them. Chen Xi had destroyed and crushed 10% of the buildings in the Violetwind Sect with a raise of his hand, whereas a light palm strike of his had obliterated all their attacks. Such ability had exceeded their imaginations since long ago, so how could they dare play with their lives?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the streets had become even more clamorous, and many cultivators in Moontrace City had come over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The string of events that had occurred earlier caused their eyes to be dazzled, and they were unable to recover from their shock. The audacity of this young man had shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly go over and watch! There’s actually someone that has trespassed into the Violetwind Sect by himself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How terrifying! The entrance to the Violetwind Sect has actually been crushed, and so many buildings have transformed into ruins!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look! Quickly! It’s that young man! I wonder where he’s from to actually dare do such an audacious thing! He’ll probably be suppressed and annihilated later, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at the collapsed entrance of the Violetwind Sect and the ruins that covered the entire ground, everyone started to discuss animatedly and felt surprised and bewildered. They seemed to not dare believe that someone dared caused trouble in the territory of the Violetwind Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the Violetwind Sect was simply a local tyrant in Moontrace City, and it hadn’t been shaken since its establishment a few hundred years. Moreover, there wasn’t a single person that had dared to challenge the entire Violetwind Sect by himself because this was simply no different than courting death!</span></p>

Moreover, according to the situation, this person was even in a slightly superior position, and this naturally drew a great stir in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s still another breath of time!” Chen Xi utterly disregarded everything in the surroundings, and his icy cold gaze stared indifferently towards the depths of the Violetwind Sect while his voice swept out like a gust of wind in depths of winter and caused the hearts of all the Violetwind Sect disciples to go cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere instantly became oppressive, and it caused the breathing of everyone to become difficult. It was even to the extent that some people even intended to turn around and flee from the terror they felt from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! What audacity! A little child dares to come cause trouble at the Violetwind Sect? You’re simply courting death!” Right at this moment, numerous jet black streaks suddenly flashed out from the depths of the Violetwind Sect, and they emitted a sharp sound as they tore the air apart. At the same time, bloody killing intent that was dense to the point of seeming material covered the heavens and the earth as it enveloped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>

Every single one of them had gloomy aura and were filled with a bloody aura that surged extremely, and they were precisely five of the seven dark pheasant demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just the disciples of the Violetwind Sect that were astounded, even the other cultivators that were spectating from the distance were extremely shocked when they saw these five demon cultivators.</span></p>

They could be said to be infamous and have committed countless crimes. How could everyone present possibly be unable to recognize them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was precisely because they recognized these five demons that it caused them to be astounded and terrified. Because these five demons had actually emerged from within the Violetwind Sect at this moment, so didn’t that mean that the Violetwind Sect had colluded with them a long time ago?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This change in the events was too sudden, causing everyone present to feel uneasy, and the atmosphere became even more silent and oppressive while the air seemed to have frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hand over my Senior Brother Qing Yu, otherwise, I’ll surely kill without mercy!” Chen Xi stood on the ruins, and he directly spoke out coldly upon seeing these five demons that had appeared abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing these demons make an appearance had already allowed him to completely understand that the matter of Senior Brother Qing Yu being entrapped was really connected to the Violetwind Sect. This caused the killing intent in his heart to surge, and he already couldn’t be bothered to waste time talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Yu? That shy young man? Sorry but he has already been eaten alive by us brothers. Hahaha!” Yin Xiong revealed a mouthful of ghastly white teeth as he roared with laughter.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d already discerned that the one with the highest cultivation amongst these demons was only at the 6<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm, whereas the others were all around the 4<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm. This was simply a group of useless trash to him, so how could they possibly be able to eat Qing Yu?</span></p>

With Ling Bai’s cultivation that could advance to the Nether Transformation Realm at any moment, killing these fellows was as easy as blowing off dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he utterly didn’t believe that Qing Yu had already met with misfortune.</span></p>

A fledgling kid actually dares to talk nonsense? Kneel!” The seventh demon, Qu Mu, who had the most explosive temper shouted out explosively before he suddenly swung out the blood colored chain in his hand. It struck towards Chen Xi’s knees like a blood dragon that bared its fangs and brandished its claws, and it intended to severe Chen Xi’s knees and force him to kneel.</span></p>

In the next moment, he’d already arrived before Qu Mu.</span></p>

Hand over my Senior Brother Qing Yu, otherwise I’ll kill without mercy!” Right amidst this shocked atmosphere, Chen Xi’s icy cold and murderous voice suddenly drifted out, and it shocked everyone to the point their bodies trembled and a chill ran down their spines.</span></p>
