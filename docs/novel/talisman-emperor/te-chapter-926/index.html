His strength, Dao Heart, and everything he’d learned had fused into one, allowing him to attain an unprecedented height.</span></p>

What high sounding sentiments!” Meanwhile, True Jade had already recovered from her astonishment, and her beautiful eyes narrowed slightly and became sharp like blades as they descended coldly onto Chen Xi.</span></p>

From the beginning until the end, he didn’t spare a single glance to this woman, and he just stared at Qing Xiuyi who wore fiery red palace robes while a wisp of indescribable feelings arose in his heart.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and moved his gaze from Qing Xiuyi. He still didn’t pay the slightest bit of attention to True Jade’s reproach as he shot his gaze at Bing Shitian instead.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially when he saw the pair of rings that Bing Shitian held, the wisp of bitterness in Chen Xi’s heart suddenly transformed into indescribable rage, and he wished for nothing more than tear apart and destroy everything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If I was just a step later, would I be unable to undo everything?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a haughty little fellow! Acting so arrogantly after causing trouble in my Heavenflow Dao Sect. Since you’re courting death, then you can’t blame anyone!” True Jade was completely infuriated by Chen Xi’s attitude of disregarding her, and she suddenly shouted with a grim voice while intending to slaughter Chen Xi before burning his bones and scattering the ashes because she wasn’t willing to see him for another moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s enough, you old woman!” Lie Peng struck the table before him as he stood up, and he shouted furiously. “The great Heavenflow Dao Sect set up a grand formation to obstruct my Nine Radiance Sword Sect’s disciple from coming here. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Now that your deeds are exposed, not only do you not feel ashamed, you’re even more arrogant. Is this the way your Heavenflow Dao Sect does things?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you call me?” True Jade’s entire body stiffened. Never had she imagined that someone would actually dare insult her like this, and her cold and grim face instantly darkened as she stared fixedly at Lie Peng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did I call you? As a senior, not only do you have no self-respect, you have wicked thoughts and do things in a despicable manner. Is there any difference between you and those spiteful old women in the streets of the mortal world?” Lie Peng didn’t back down and stared angrily at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present here glanced at each other when they saw this, and they frowned while feeling amused. One of these two was the senior of Bing Shitian and Qing Xiuyi that possessed a respected status and had been living in seclusion for all these years, whereas the other was the Enforcement Elder of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect that was similarly renowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, both of them disregarded their bearings and started shouting at each other, and it was truly too ridiculous. If news of this were to spread, they would probably become the laughingstocks of the entire cultivation world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Martial Aunt True Jade, calm your anger.” Meanwhile, Bing Shitian spoke abruptly and restrained True Jade. His expression was cold while he revealed an awe-inspiring appearance, and he emanated the dignified aura of an immortal from the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he finished speaking, True Jade shut her mouth right away because even though she was a senior of Bing Shitian’s, she didn’t dare go against his will at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lie Peng grunted coldly and returned to his seat when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, no matter if you arrived earlier or later, the outcome would be the same because Xiuyi has already agreed to become united with me as Dao Companions, whereas you’re utterly incapable of changing her will.” Bing Shitian turned around, and his gaze that was ethereal like the starry sky carried a unique sense of indifference as he gazed at Chen Xi. “I originally intended to let you off, but you persisted on doing this, so you can’t blame anyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of a sneer appeared on the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth as he said, “You set up layer after layer of restrictions at the entrance for the sake of letting me off? I originally thought that you were shameless but would at least have a line as a Heavenly Immortal that you wouldn’t cross. But only now did I notice that you’re shameless to the point that there’s no line that you wouldn’t cross.”</span></p>

There’re probably not many people since the ancient times that dared to do this, right?</span></p>

Alright. According to the bet from all those years ago, you’ve already lost. If I’m not wrong, then you swore all those years ago that so long as you lost, you would cripple your own cultivation and be obliterated from eternity. Moreover, if you went against this vow, then you would be destroyed by the world and condemned by both men and god!”</span></p>

If news of all of this were to be spread to the outside world, then it would probably cause the entire Dark Reverie to fall into a mighty uproar!</span></p>

But for the sake of acquiring the final victory in the bet and for the sake of obtaining Qing Xiuyi, Bing Shitian spared no means.</span></p>

Everyone held their breaths in concentration while their gazes converged unblinkingly on Qing Xiuyi because all of them were clearly aware that the words she said next would determine the fate of Chen Xi and Bing Shitian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Bing Shitian’s reaction seemed as if the scales of victory were tilted completely towards him and Chen Xi was bound to be unable to escape the situation of certain loss…</span></p>
