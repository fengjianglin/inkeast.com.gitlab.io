No one knew how vast it was, and it was formed from the Dark Parasol Divine Tree of the primeval times, causing it to be a true miracle of the gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The numerous stars within it were enormous like the true stellar bodies within the universe. They whistled as they circulated, and they gave rise to extremely violent stellar gales that were matchlessly vast and raged throughout the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, an unknown amount of suns and moons rose and fell within it, and they emitted boundless light while creating infinite amounts of storms of flames and torrents of ice that swept towards the surroundings, causing this entire sea of clouds to completely transform into a place of great danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a crimson scale beast claw had actually stretched out from one of these stars, and it covered the heavens and blotted out the sun as it tore apart the roiling sea of clouds and crashed down towards Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just the aura it emitted caused it to feel on par with a true divine beast of the primeval times!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Beasts were differentiated by realms as well, just like cultivators. But they were equivalent to experts at the Rebirth Realm while they were young and weak, and due to their shocking natural talent and noble bloodlines, their strengths were usually even more formidable and terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A primeval divine beast that had just advanced into the Nether Transformation Realm was capable of going against a few tens of cultivators at the same realm by itself. The reason was extremely simple, the capacity for True Essence that a primeval divine beast possessed was entirely not something an ordinary cultivator could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivation realm of this beast that possessed an aura that was comparable to a primeval divine beast was unknown, but Chen Xi could be sure that since it was able to survive within this temporal tide, its strength was surely terrifying to the extreme!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, a wave of horror arose in Chen Xi’s heart as he felt a life-threatening aura from it, and he knew extremely clearly that once he was struck by this beast claw that covered the sky, he would absolutely die without a doubt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

He seemed to emit the presence of a king, majestic and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the simple and ancient Talisman Armament appeared in his hand amidst a faint sword howl and the five Divine Talismans that occupied it emitted boundless might while talisman markings roiled, causing it to seem brilliant like a sun that soared up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely the best sword strike Chen Xi had slashed out since he’d started cultivating. The might of the strike was tremendous and carried an all-powerful and brilliant divine might that caused the world to go into chaos, and it slashed apart the shackles of space and was sharp and fierce to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this strike, the profound tune of the Grand Dao rumbled out along with the chanting of the gods, and numerous images that seemed like the gods appeared. They were the phenomena formed from the five great Divine Talismans within the Talisman Armament when circulated to the limit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before this sword strike, even top cultivators at the Nether Transformation Realm like Wang Zhonghuan and Long Zhenbei would probably have no choice but to dodge and not dare bear the blunt of this strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Insight and beast claw collided, causing an enormous bang that shook the heavens and the earth to erupt from it, and it was like the heavens and the earth were collapsing, or two volcanos had collided with each other. Merely the airflow that was blasted out from the collision caused the dense mist in an area of 5,000km to be completely swept away, and an empty space was revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was in the outside world, such a collision that shook the heavens was sufficient to crush an entire city!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi coughed out blood as his figure was blasted flying 30km away by an enormous force, and he was in an extremely sorry state while his expression was covered in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His best sword strike wasn’t just unable to slash apart that enormous beast claw, he was even struck by the aftershock to the point of being injured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the sword in his hand was even sharper than a Quasi Immortal Artifact and coupled with his superb Sword Dao that had attained the stage of forming Sword Qi Threads, he actually didn’t harm that beast claw in the slightest. Didn’t this mean that merely the beast claw was already even more hard and terrifying than a Quasi Immortal Artifact?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what caused Chen Xi to feel slightly fortunate was that even though this strike hadn’t injured the terrifying ferocious beast, it had won him a tiny bit of time to catch his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely in this tiny bit of time that he saw the ferocious beast clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The body of the ferocious beast that had already stood up on the star was like a leopard that was the size of a mountain, had the body of a dragon that was covered in crimson red scales, and its claws were like four pillars that could hold up the sky. It stood towering there while emitting a violent and bloodthirsty aura that was terrifying. Every single exhale and inhale of it was like a typhoon that shook the world and caused enormous bangs that were like thunderclaps!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most shocking of it all was that it held a sharp sword within its bloody mouth. The blade of the sword was blood red, and it was dense to the point it seemed on the verge of dripping blood. The edges of the sword were serrated and ghastly cold, and it emitted a bloody aura that caused one’s heart to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yazi!” At the instant he saw his opponent clearly, Chen Xi’s pupils couldn’t help but constrict as he cried out involuntarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yazi was one of the renowned ferocious beasts in the primeval times. According to legend, it was the son of the dragon of the primeval times. It was brave, fond of battle, and bloodthirsty. All who dared offend it would surely encounter endless pursuit until they were killed, and there was never an exception!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saying that a Yazi always took revenge described the violent killing intent of this ferocious beast of the primeval times, and it displayed how heavy its desire for revenge was. It wouldn’t stop until it killed its opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is absolutely a pure blooded Yazi! But its strength seems…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst his shock, Chen Xi inadvertently swept the Yazi with his Eye of Divine Truth, and he noticed unexpectedly that the Yazi’s strength seemed to be dissipating at an alarming speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the bloodthirsty imposing aura emitted from its entire body was like a breached dam, and it had lost its former might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was extremely shocked. He was able to clearly sense that this terrifying ferocious beast that was renowned during the primeval times had a strength that had probably attained the Earthly Immortal Realm since long ago. But now, its strength was actually dissipating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Or perhaps it could be said that its attack from before had already greatly exhausted its physical strength, and it was already gradually unable to hold on any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that this ferocious beast had been trapped here for countless years, and due to lacking sufficient True Essence to replenish its strength, it’s already on the verge of death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart shook abruptly when he thought up to here.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he didn’t dare make any rash moves. Even if the strength of his opponent was weakening, it was absolutely not something he was able to go against now, and he even suspected that once he charged forward, it was extremely likely that he would suffer the dying strike of the Yazi that was absolutely terrifying to the extreme.</span></p>

Moreover, it even carried a trace of extreme yearning…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like an unbearably hungry wolf had suddenly seen a plump goat.</span></p>

Its enormous claw tore through the sky while carrying a myriad of flaming rays of light, and it was like a rainbow that penetrated through the sky as it clawed at Chen Xi with a monstrous impetus and peerless divine might.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea of clouds in an area of 5,000km even fell into a great expanse of chaos. Air flowed about chaotically while gales charged about in disorder. If someone were to fall into this area now, then the person would surely be instantly minced apart and transformed into ash.</span></p>

It lacked a bit of violent bloodthirstiness and revealed a dense feeling of unwillingness and despair instead, and it shook the surrounding space to the point a terrifying chaotic tempest was created.</span></p>

In the next moment, he’d vanished on the spot and charged towards the star the Yazi resided on earlier.</span></p>

As the offspring of the dragon of the primeval times, it possesses a noble bloodline and peerlessly formidable strength. Now that it has perished, its corpse is comparable to a great treasure trove!</span></p>

Never had he ever imagined that such a formidable ferocious beast of the primeval times would actually die like this…</span></p>

Its skin, fur, bones, tendons, flesh, blood… Everything was a priceless rare material that could be utilized for equipment refinement or pill refinement.</span></p>
