 <p>Chapter 172 – Hua Hong</p>
 <p>When he thought up to here, Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh. Those that possessed both wealth and power were always the group of people that trampled on the rules. Whereas those with neither wealth nor power would always be unable to enjoy the fairness that was brought about by the rules, and they would instead be bullied and oppressed, becoming the sacrifices of the rules and the stepping stones of others.</p>
 <p>There was only one way to change the unspoken rule that was tacitly acknowledged in every corner of this world, and that was to become strong!</p>
 <p>At this moment, under the gazes of pity, mocking, and pleasure from the surroundings, the youth, Zhu Xun’s, dark face flushed red and warped from the oppression he felt, and flames of rage blazed within his eyes. His firm and thick chest rapidly rose and fell as he tightly clenched his fists, and his slightly sharp nails sunk into his flesh to tear open traces of bloodstains, yet he seemed to have not noticed it in the slightest.</p>
 <p>He was only an honest son of a mountain hunter, so how could he have imagined that the people in this world actually changed their attitudes so arbitrarily? Or were so shameless? So unscrupulously stripping him of the results he’d attained from his own hard work?</p>
 <p>He was unable to wrap his head around it.</p>
 <p>So he was extremely enraged and stubborn like a cow as his eyes stared fixedly at that Inner Court disciple behind the table. He wanted an explanation.</p>
 <p>That Inner Court disciple was called Fu Zheng. He’d originally felt a trace of pity towards Zhu Xun in his heart, but when he came into contact with the rage in Zhu Xun’s eyes, he was instantly irritated as well, and he snorted coldly before turning around. He couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to this stupid bumpkin any longer.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, another young girl that wore a seven colored glazed dress, with delicate features that were supple and white like snow walked over, and her beautiful face revealed dense proudness as if she was a proud little swan. She looked neither left nor right and strode gracefully to slowly walk to arrive before the table.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi clearly remembered that this young girl was called Xie Qiqiao, and she was also eliminated when the Illusory Devilrock Grand Formation was activated. At this moment, her actions of walking to stand before the table were self-evident.</p>
 <p>As expected, when they saw the proud young girl, Xie Qiqiao, arrive, besides Zhu Xun, all the other 12 young men and young women that had passed the test of will became anxious. They were able to discern that this young girl was probably similar to Liu Chen from before, and she was going to obtain a position amongst those that had passed the test. However, if she obtained a position, then one of them would surely be eliminated. Yet who would be willing to cup their hands and give it away willingly?</p>
 <p>Elder Hua Hong who had his eyes closed while pondering leisurely opened his eyes once again, and his eyes lit up when he saw Xie Qiqiao. He nodded with a smile before restraining his smile, and then his gaze swept towards the 12 young men and young women that had passed the test.</p>
 <p>“You, you’re disqualified from the test. Leave.” Hua Hong swept all of them with his gaze before stopping on Mu Yao, His eyes were extremely discerning, and only from disposition and actions, he was able to discern that this young girl surely didn’t have any background. So, he decided right away to strip her of her position and give it to Xie Qiqiao.</p>
 <p>Mu Yao was stunned, and a wisp of rage gushed out onto her elegant face. During her participation in the sect entrance test this time, she’d replied fully on her own hard work to walk up to here, and she originally thought that after she passed, Big Brother Chen Xi would view her in a different light. How could she have imagined that such a shameless thing like this would actually occur to her?</p>
 <p>If it was before she arrived at Dragon Lake City, Mu Yao would surely swallow the humiliation and obediently leave, but during these past few years, because of her relationship with Chen Xi, she’d seen many great figures with monstrous power. Just yesterday, she’d been sitting together and talking with the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s Supreme Elder Bei Heng and the Sect Master Ling Kongzi. Although she could only listen respectfully, who dared to overlook her?</p>
 <p>So with this abundant experience, Mu Yao could be said to be extremely confident, and she took a deep breath before slowly saying, “I don’t agree.”</p>
 <p>As soon as she finished speaking, everyone present was stunned, as they seemed to have never expected that Mu Yao would actually be so audacious to refuse Elder Hua Hong in his face. <i>Could it be that she isn’t afraid of being unable to leave the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect?</i></p>
 <p>“Hmph! Where did this village girl come from? Do you know any manners? Do you know who you’re facing? Quickly fuck off and don’t make a fool of yourself here.” Before anyone could speak, Xie Qiqiao raised her chin before speaking arrogantly and disdainfully.</p>
 <p>“Truly shameless to the limit. You failed as soon as the test of will began. Not to mention your natural talent being terrible, now you’re even shamelessly taking away my positions. Is there a woman in the world who’s your equal in being shameless?” Mu Yao wasn’t enraged in the slightest, and her expression was calm as she gave tit for tat.</p>
 <p>“A lowly woman like you with neither authority nor background actually dares to call me shameless?” Xie Qiqiao was instantly angered to the point of crying out with a sharp voice, and her beautiful face was frustrated and indeterminate as she turned around to look at Elder Hua Hong. “Uncle Hua, could it be that you’re not going to do anything?”</p>
 <p>“Alright, Qiqiao, calm down.” Hua Hong stood up and waved his hand before raising his eyes to look at Mu Yao and say with an expressionless face. “Junior, I’ll give you one last chance. Obediently leave, otherwise…”</p>
 <p>“Martial Uncle Hua, I think you should let this matter go.” Right at this moment, a young woman in an azure dress parted the crowd as she walked over slowly. Her long hair was pitch black with willow shaped brows, clear eyes, and extremely delicate skin, and she was extremely beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Qingni?” Mu Yao cried out.</p>
 <p>This young girl in an azure dress was precisely Yan Qingni, one of the 36 Elite Disciples of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. She nodded with a smile at Mu Yao before shooting her gaze at Hua Hong.</p>
 <p><i>No wonder, so it turns out that this little girl has someone backing her as well!</i></p>
 <p>The surrounding spectators instantly came to a sudden understanding.</p>
 <p>When he saw Yan Qingni make an appearance, Chen Xi, who was prepared to lend a hand, nodded to himself and silently waited for the situation to unfold. Unless he had to, he wasn’t willing to make it difficult for Hua Hong before so many people. After all, he’d received too much care from Bei Heng during these past few years. Although he detested Hua Hong to the limit, it wasn’t good for him to forcefully intervene in the matters of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, so as to avoid people having misgivings that he was a busybody and interfered in the authority of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect.</p>
 <p>At this moment, having a Wanderingcloud Sword Sect Elite Disciples like Yan Qingni stand out couldn’t be any better.</p>
 <p>But the development of the matter didn’t resolve according to Chen Xi’s will.</p>
 <p>Hua Hong started laughing from extreme rage, and his expression was ominous as he said coldly, “Hmph! Qingni, you’re only an Elite Disciple, whereas I’m an Elder. This test of will is managed by me. Is this a place for you to interfere?”</p>
 <p>He was truly too angry. Being refused by a little girl that had no authority nor background had already caused him to feel extremely uncomfortable, and now another Elite Disciple had come to order him about. If he didn’t show his uncompromising attitude of handling it, then where would he put his face before so many people?</p>
 <p>“Martial Uncle Hua Hong, do you really want to strip Mu Yao of her position?” Yan Qingni took a deep breath and spoke slowly.</p>
 <p>She’d noticed Chen Xi in the crowd as well, and just happened to see the difficult position Mu Yao was in. She decided right away to stand out and lend a hand, so as to do Chen Xi a favor. As for revealing Chen Xi’s identity, she wouldn’t do that. Because she’d already guessed that Chen Xi was surely hiding in the crowd because he was unwilling to make an appearance due to some sort of reason. Otherwise, with his ability, he’d surely have dealt with everything long ago.</p>
 <p>“What? You want to question my decision? Believe me, I’ll exile you to Dragonhell Peak to serve as a lowly coolie for three months!” Hua Hong became even more enraged, yet his face was expressionless as he spoke coldly.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Hua is right! What’s so amazing about being an Elite Disciples? Once I pass through the sect’s test, and I’ll surely become the number one amongst the Elite Disciples and replace Fei Lengcui’s status in one go.” Xie Qiqiao glanced at Yan Qingni with disdain, and her words revealed an indescribable sense of superiority.</p>
 <p>Yan Qingni sighed and didn’t say anything further. If one wanted to see death, then it would be impossible to stop.</p>
 <p>When she saw this, Xie Qiqiao thought that Yan Qingni was afraid and a trace of complacency couldn’t help but appear on the corners of her mouth.</p>
 <p>Hua Hong’s expression eased up before looking at Mu Yao and instructing coldly. “Fu Zheng, seize her and cripple her cultivation before exiling her to Dragonhell Peak to be a coolie slave for her entire lifetime. I want everyone to understand that the consequences of offending my Wanderingcloud Sword Sect is that they’re bound to pay a heavy price.”</p>
 <p>“Are you really going to do this?” Right at this moment, an indifferent voice sounded out once more.</p>
 <p>Hua Hong turned around to look over when he heard this, yet he noticed a tall and handsome young man walking over slowly, and his face couldn’t help but twitch fiercely as the flames of rage in his heart were almost to the point of being impossible to control. <i>What’s going on today? Could it be that all these Toms, Dicks, and Harrys want to challenge my authority?</i></p>
 <p>The young man was Chen Xi. He’d always been sitting on the spot at True Heart Peak during all these years, and it could be said that besides Bei Heng and a few others, the other elders and disciples of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect only knew of Chen Xi’s name. As for his appearance, most of them had never seen it before. After all, the total disciples in the Inner Court and Outer Court of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect were made up of an entire 100,000 people.</p>
 <p>It was normal that Hua Hong didn’t recognize Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“Junior, who are you? You actually dare intervene in the business of my Wanderingcloud Sword Sect? Since you’re courting death, then I’ll fulfill your wish and exile you along with this little girl to Dragonhell Peak to be slaves that are unable to leave for your entire lifetime! Disciples! Seize this kid along with the little girl and send them to Dragonhell Peak!” Hua Hong shouted loudly with a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Fu Zheng and the other seven Inner Court disciples flashed out explosively and parted into two groups, three of them pounced towards Mu Yao, while the other four pounced towards Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, everyone only felt something flash before their eyes and the four Inner Court disciples that pounced towards Chen Xi flew out over 100 meters, as if they were smashed by an enormous iron hammer. All of them had swollen right cheeks, their mouths spitting blood, and they curled on the ground as they moaned in pain.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Yan Qingni had fearlessly made a move as well and stood before Mu Yao. She was an extremely intelligent person and was naturally able to distinguish between advantage and disadvantage. At this moment, standing on Chen Xi’s side was absolutely beneficial without any disadvantage.</p>
 <p>As soon as Yan Qingni stood before Mu Yao, those three Inner Court disciples instantly didn’t dare move forward. After all, their identities were clear to see, they were merely Inner Court disciples, whereas, Yan Qingni was instead an Elite Disciple. How could they possibly dare make a move against an Elite Disciple?</p>
 <p>“Alright! You arbitrarily attacked and injured disciples of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. Your crime is unforgivable! No one is able to say anything about me killing you now!” Hua Hong shouted out coldly, as dense killing intent instantly arose on his face, and then the tip of his foot stepped on the ground, causing his entire body to seem like an arrow that left the bow as he flashed explosively towards Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>As one of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s elders, Hua Hong’s cultivation had already broken through to the Rebirth Realm the year before last. When he attacked at this moment, it was like a bolt of lightning that struck out, and his entire body emitted a terrifying and fierce aura that crushed the surrounding space to the point it buzzed. Everyone in the surroundings felt suffocated and felt as if a hill had pressed onto them, causing them to almost spit blood and be suffocated.</p>
 <p>“Idiot! Stay your hand!” Right at this moment, an oppressive and explosive shout that carried boundless power and influence was like rolling thunder as it resounded out explosively in the heaven and earth with a bang.</p>
