He wore simple beast skin that revealed muscles that were hard like rocks, and he held a pitch black and low quality bow made from the horn of a beast.</span></p>

She similarly wore beast skin clothes, and she revealed a pair of slender and white arms and legs.</span></p>

Xiao Yan was a child the Priest brought up by himself, and she had been sensible and intelligent since a young age. On the other hand, the Lord Priest was sick now, and he was on the verge of passing away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little girl Xiao Yan had heard from someone that if the water of the River of Hell was used to boil medicine, it could extend one’s lifespan and restore one’s vitality. From that day onward, she would come to the River of Hell to fetch water every single day to boil medicine for the Priest.</span></p>

The Priest had suffered a lethal injury, and he could only live for a few more days.</span></p>

It was truly a wonder as to what they’d experienced to allow them to become so sensible and obedient.</span></p>

His face and hands were covered in wrinkled that were like ravines, and his gaze was dim and muddy, causing him to seem extremely aged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How long can the food last?” The old man spoke with a low and hoarse voice that was even accompanied with a wave of rapid gasping for breath, and it caused others to be very worried that he would breathe his last breath in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Priest, Chieftain Meng Wei and I have hunted many bone hawks all along the way, and coupled with our current food, it’s roughly able to last for a month.” A young woman spoke respectfully. Her figure was tall and slender with breathtaking curves, and her jet black hair was tied up into a ponytail to reveal an icy cold and gorgeous appearance. Moreover, her tone and expression revealed a straightforward feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A month? It’s too little…” The old man sighed deeply as a wisp of worry appeared in his muddy eyes. After a long time, he asked with a hoarse voice once more. “How many people do we have left?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“13 infants, 76 youths, and 9 guards of the clan,” replied the young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another three guards have died?” The worry in the old man’s eyes grew even denser, and it caused the atmosphere within the tent to become oppressive and low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman puckered her lips and didn’t know how to answer the old man because her heart felt extremely heavy as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you have done well. These children are the hope of our clan. So what even if we sacrifice these people for their sakes?” The old man muttered with a voice that revealed dense sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Priest, we…. Can we really walk out of this place of exile?” The young woman raised her head up abruptly and looked at the old man on the bed while revealed a rare wisp of a lost feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo Ya, do you still remember the prophecy inscribed beneath the clan?” The old man asked with a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do.” Mo Ya nodded, and it was unknown what she recalled, but her gaze turned firm once more and she wasn’t lost any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For the sake of the hope of our clan, you and Meng Wei must live on. Bring those children out to see the world, the place our Ancestors once lived.” A wisp of recollection appeared on the wrinkled face of the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll surely succeed!” Mo Ya puckered her lips and bit her teeth tightly, and then she suddenly stared blankly as she said, “Lord Priest, what about you? Could it be that you won’t be going with us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me?” The old man suddenly started laughing, and he revealed a wisp of melancholy. “I’ve lived my entire life here and guarded here my entire lifetime. In the end, I could only watch idly by as a calamity broke through the seal and re-emerged into the world. I’m…ashamed to face our Ancestors!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then…” Mo Ya frowned and intended to say something. Right at this moment, the flap of the tent was lifted open, and a tall and stalwart middle aged man walked in. It was Meng Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Priest, I picked this person up at the side of the River of Hell.” Meng Wei spoke as he lightly placed the person on his back onto the ground, and his movements were gentle and careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because he was extremely worried that he would break this person apart if he used slight force. After all, this fellows’ injuries were too horrible, his skin and flesh were split apart to the point even his bones were exposed, and it was simply too horrifying to look at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for him having detected that this person still carried a trace of vitality, he would have almost thought he’d rescued a corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s only a corpse, why waste your strength to bring it back?” Mo Ya swept the young man on the ground that didn’t move in the slightest, and she frowned as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He still has a trace of vitality.” Meng Wei explained with a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The River of Hell?” On the bed, the face of the old man that was covered with wrinkles revealed a wisp of surprise, and he suddenly struggled to get up before pointing at the young man on the ground as he said with an anxious voice, “Quickly tear off a piece of his clothes and let me have a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei did as he was told. Only now did he notice the clothes worn by this young man were extremely strange, and it was completely different to the beast skin he wore. The clothes were soft, smooth, and carried a trace of a strange defensive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As expected, this is a treasure that can only be obtained in the outside world!” The old man sized up the cloth in his hand before a wisp of indescribable excitement surged out into his muddy eyes. “These clothes are refined from various spirit materials and have layer upon layer of formations set up on it. It ought to be called ‘treasured clothes’!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit materials? Treasured clothes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei and Mo Ya glanced at each other, and both of them were confused. For generations and generations, their ancestors had lived on this land that was in complete darkness. They used beast skin as clothes, the meat of various ferocious monsters as food, and it was extremely difficult for them to imagine what were spirit materials and what treasured clothes were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they were able to faintly discern from the priest’s reaction that this young man who lay on the ground like a corpse seemed…to be from the outside world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly! No matter what, you must save him and ask him exactly how he arrived at the Ninth Hell that’s said to have no way out!” The old man suddenly became excited, and his low and hoarse voice revealed excitement and joy that was impossible to conceal.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
