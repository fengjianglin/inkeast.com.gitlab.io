 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

It wasn’t surprising, as she’d lost her will to fight after she witnessed the battle between Chen Xi and Wei Yuezi and had long since aroused the intention to retreat. Chen Xi instead held the intention of killing her to keep her silent, so he attacked with his full strength. Would Lin Qiuling have the chance to survive under this difference?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t only Lin Qiuling, Meng Chixing that was still unconscious and the other 10 plus Golden Hall Realm servants that followed them had been completely exterminated without the slightest mercy by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up to this point, the group of people that had come from Five Element Sword Sect to provide aid had been exterminated, and this was an outcome that no one present had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood suffused the air and suffocated one’s eyes and nose.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially when they saw the beautiful woman, Lin Qiuling, being killed by Chen Xi without batting an eye, and her beautiful soul perishing forever, it caused all of them to be extremely horrified. In their hearts, they’d already taken Chen Xi to be a cold and emotionless executioner that slaughtered without batting an eye and was both cruel and merciless. When he carried out a slaughter to keep people quiet, he acted without the slightest scruples and utterly didn’t differentiate between men or women, old or young, and he killed on a whim with extreme cold-bloodedness and ruthlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was precisely because Chen Xi had fully displayed his bloody and resolute methods that it awed everyone present, causing them to not dare leak the news of this incident, as they were worried they would offend this maleficent existence and bring death to themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoists, these people were excessively greedy, and their deaths are nothing to be regretted. Now that my older brother has come out from closed door cultivation, I presume everyone has seen his strength. With him present, everyone doesn’t have to worry about the calamity brought about by the packs of beast spreading. But for safety’s sake, everyone should swiftly rush back to their clans and institutions to bring back your disciples and move into my Chen Clan Mansion. In this way, they’ll be even safer. What does everyone think?” Chen Hao’s gaze swept past everyone as he spoke suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course.”</span></p>

We’ll go gather our clansmen right away and rush over to the Chen Clan to tide over these difficult times together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leaders of the various powers of Pine Mist City spoke out in agreement. After they witnessed Chen Xi’s strength, they naturally know what they should do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you really want to take in the clansmen and members behind these people? Does Big Brother agree to this?” At the rear courtyard of the Chen Clan Mansion, Fei Lengcui frowned as she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao let out a breath of air before smiling. “Big Brother doesn’t care about these trivial matters. Not to mention taking in the clansmen of these various clans into our Chen Clan is for the sake of the Chen Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Fei Lengcui was a mother now, she was the leading figure in the younger generation of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect all those years ago, so she was naturally exceedingly wise, and she instantly understood the workings behind it and smiled. “So that’s how it is. Since Big Brother killed the disciples of the Five Element Sword Sect under the gazes of everyone, now that we’ve taken in the clansmen of these powers into the Chen Clan, it can serve as a warning. If anyone wanted to leak this news, they’d have to consider the safety of their clansmen, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao laughed loudly as he nodded. “Exactly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, what’re you laughing about? Quickly accompany Yu’er in my sword training. Once I’ve grown up, I want to seize the first in the Hidden Dragon Rankings just like Uncle.” Little Chen Yu held a little wooden sword as he ran into the house.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sat cross-legged in his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle today had allowed him to obtain a clear understanding of his own strength, and especially the Starsky Wings and Talisman Armament had given him an enormously pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One possessed a crushing advantage in speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other instead possessed a formidable amplification effect towards the Dao Grade martial techniques he executed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When both of them were combined they at least allowed his strength to rise explosively by around 30%. According to Chen Xi’s inference, even top Golden Core Realm experts like Huangfu Chongming, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger would probably be far from being his match. But, if he was compared to Qin Xiuyi, then he would obviously be slightly inferior…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t that Chen Xi wasn’t confident, but along with the advancement of his cultivation, it allowed him to more deeply perceive Qin Xiuyi’s strength. After all, this woman was capable of being equally matched with Fan Yunlan who was at the Rebirth Realm. Even though her cultivation was at the Golden Core Realm, but the combat strength she possessed had already exceeded the scope of the Golden Core Realm and couldn’t be judged by common sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps I can compete with Qin Xiuyi after I advance into the Golden Core Realm? Wait, this woman is a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal, and she’s similarly improving as I improve. I’m afraid it won’t be so easy for me to chase after her…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi thought over and over again yet was unable to come to a conclusion, and he couldn’t help but shake his head and concentrate his attention on himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starsky Wings is a Divine Ability, and it’ll cause it to be extremely easy for others to recognize my cultivation in body refinement. It’s not advisable to expose it in my future battles. Fortunately, within the inheritance of the Starsky Wings is a technique to conceal its aura, so I don’t have to bitterly think of a way.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Chen Xi’s heart, his body refinement cultivation could entirely be taken to be a trump card of his, and the less people that knew about it, the more capable it would be of taking his opponents by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Talisman Armament, I don’t have to conceal it as no one is capable of discerning its quality, and it’s sufficient so long as no one finds out about its profundity.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought about the Talisman Armament, Chen Xi commanded in his heart before opening his mouth to spit out a ray of light, and then it transformed into the one meter long Talisman Armament. Its ancient and simple construction and its pitch black like obsidian body caused it to seem rather inconspicuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But only Chen Xi knew how formidable the might of the Talisman Armament was. It possessed a practically limitless space for evolution, and it even possessed an amplification effect towards the strength of Dao Insights. If it were to fall into the outside world, it would surely cause the entire cultivation world to be shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, the Azure Divine Wood, Sunforce Metal, Flaming Divine Crystal, and Unity Darkwater are garrisoned within the Talisman Armament, allowing them to constantly nurture the intelligence of the sword, temper the sharpness of the blade, refine the impurities sword, and cleanse the markings on the surface of the sword. The Yellowearth Divine Talisman in the fuller of the sword also has the Chaotic Lifesoil garrisoned within it, and it possesses an extremely great beneficial effect towards the hardness of the sword. Logically speaking, the quality of the Talisman Armament is already not inferior to a top-grade earth-rank Magic Treasure…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi thought for a moment and decided to personally test the true might of the Talisman Armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dazzling golden sword appeared in his hand. Its body was narrow, long, and thin like a cicada’s wings, with many dense and profound talisman marking patterns inscribed on it, and it emitted strong seventh-gold qi. This sword was left behind by Wei Yuezi after his death, and it was a top-grade earth-rank sword called Shatterscar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi gritted his teeth before circulating his full strength into the Talisman Armament and fiercely slashing down onto Shatterscar, causing golden sparks to fly out as a deafening sound resounded out. Shockingly, a crack had appeared on Shatterscar, and it was only a finger’s length away from causing it to split from the center, whereas, the Talisman Armament in Chen Xi’s hand was completely unharmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amazing! The strength of the Talisman Armament has already almost surpassed the top-grade earth-rank!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi gasped with admiration in his head, and he was roughly able to confirm that the current quality of the Talisman Armament ought to be above the top-grade earth-rank, yet inferior to a heaven-rank Magic Treasure. If it was a low-grade heaven-rank sword, it would be sufficient to slash apart a top-grade earth-rank Magic Treasure with a single strike.</span></p>

In the hands of a Heavenly Immortal, even a piece of scrap metal was sufficient to shatter a heaven-rank Magic Treasure, and this was decided by the Heavenly Immortal’s own strength and not the quality of the Magic Treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi’s method of testing was blunt, when competing in terms of the quality of a Magic Treasure, the outcome of his test wouldn’t be much different from the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he summed up the experience and insufficiencies in the battle today, Chen Xi didn’t dally to push on and take out the dark golden jade slip that recorded the Grand Obliteration Fist to carefully comprehend it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Allstar Meeting would start in less than two years of time, and at that time, the geniuses in the entire territory of the Darchu Dynasty would gather at Silken City from all over and carry out an unprecedentedly grand feast of martial competitions. To every single Golden Core Realm expert below the age of 30, it was undoubtedly a good chance to make a name for one’s self and become renowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the people who’re ranked in the top ten during the Allstar meeting were even able to represent the Darchu Dynasty to enter the Primeval Battlefield and compete for the qualifications to enter the Dark Reverie! &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s ultimate objective in participating in the Allstar Meeting was the win the qualifications to enter the Dark Reverie, and as for making a name for himself and standing out, he didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if the qualifications for entering the Dark Reverie weren’t mentioned for now, wanting to obtain the top 10 ranks in the Allstar Meeting was absolutely not as easy as one would imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just think about, the figures that were capable of participating in the Allstar Meeting were all Golden Core Realm experts below the age of 30. They were from all around the Darchu Dynasty, and their number was shockingly enormous. There would surely be no lack of extraordinary geniuses like Huangfu Chongming, and even monstrous existences like Qing Xiuyi wouldn’t just total to one or two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The difficulty of seizing the top 10 positions with so many genius experts was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of these considerations that Chen Xi would cultivate so desperately and didn’t dare slack off in the slightest, as compared to the other people, he didn’t even have the qualifications to participate in the Allstar Meeting right now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple, he hadn’t advanced into the Golden Core Realm yet. According to the rules of the Allstar Meeting, only Golden Core Realm cultivators below the age of 30 could participate in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, exactly how great the pressure Chen Xi faced now was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wanted to advance into the Golden Core Realm, then he had to experience the tribulation of wind and fire that caused any cultivator to go pale just from mentioning it, and this was similarly not as easy as one would imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the 30 years he’d been in closed door cultivation in the world of stars, he’d long since attained the perfection-stage of the Golden Hall Realm in qi refinement, and he’d even faintly possessed indications of breaking through into the Golden Core Realm, but he didn’t dare take that step for a long time. The reason was the existence of the tribulation of wind and fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi wasn’t anxious, as there was more than a year of time until the Allstar Meeting, so he had sufficient time. He intended to find the most optimum time to break through before jumping to the Golden Core Realm, as this was the very best choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</span></p>

Could it be that something has happened again?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What happened?” Chen Xi waved his hand and interrupted Chen Hao. He knew that since his younger brother had spoken like this, then it indicated that the trouble this time would surely not be small, otherwise Chen Hao would absolutely not come disturb his secluded cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another pack of beasts charged out of the depths of the mountain range just a moment ago, and it’s a pack of over a thousand. Amongst them are a few hundred Violet Palace Realm greater demons and 40 Golden Hall Realm greater demons. They’re coming fiercely in a scale that far exceeds the past.” Chen Hao said swiftly, “Most severe of it all is that there are two Golden Core Realm greater demons in charge of this pack of beasts. If they’re to charge into Pine Mist City, then the entire city will probably be lost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s brows raised. When packs of beasts had attained a scale like this, it was already almost a beast tide. Just think about it, over a thousand demon beasts covering the heavens and the earth as they surged over, the scene was extremely terrifying indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao licked his lips and continued. “Originally, if something like this happened, I wouldn’t trouble you, but the clansmen of the various other powers are rushing towards our Chen Clan right now. I’m afraid they’ll be unable to finish moving in a short period of time, so if the pack of beasts invades, I’m afraid…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” Before Chen Hao could finish speaking, Chen Xi had already stepped out to flash towards the outside of Pine Mist City. He knew that the more time he delayed, the more dangerous it would be for the others, and he had to respond swiftly.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
