 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, it doesn’t seem to be advisable to leave her to do this, right?” said a student of the Enforcement Hall. He wore a high crown, ancient clothes, and had a narrow and long face. He was called Zuoqiu Chuan, and he was Zuoqiu Jun’s actual younger brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let her go do it first. Even if she fails, it’ll make the other seniors make a move. This is a unspoken rule when new students entered the academy, and so long they participate in it, then it’ll be impossible for them to avoid getting involved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if, I’m saying what if no one is a match for Chen Xi?” Zuoqiu Chuan hesitated to speak these words. There was always truth behind a reputation, so since Chen Xi was able to obtain the first amongst the new students, then it was absolutely not obtained by luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun’s eyes turned cold. “If we can’t find a match for him amongst his peers of the same cultivation realm, then we’ll get an expert at the Golden Immortal Realm to truly discuss the Dao with him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Chuan couldn’t help but speak with embarrassment when he heard this. “Sixty percent of the eight thousand students in the outer court are at the Mysterious Immortal Realm, whereas, practically everyone amongst these sixty percent of students are at the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Some have stayed at the same cultivation for a few hundred years, some over stayed for a few tens of years. Their accumulations are deep, and their combat strength are stronger in correspondence to this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun directly interrupted him and asked. “Be frank, who amongst the seniors at the Mysterious Immortal Realm possesses the strongest combat strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Chuan was stunned, and then he said without the slightest hesitation, “It’s naturally Ning Meng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this name was mentioned, an extraordinarily handsome young man with a feminine bearing suddenly flashed into appearance within his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ning Meng?” Zuoqiu Jun repeated it once more before he nodded and said, “Is there anyone else besides him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Chuan took a deep breath and pondered before he said, “The others are Xing Yuanhang, Gongyang Longfei, Wang Wenyuan, Li Wencong…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Record all their names. I’ll arrange for people to go meet them.” Zuoqiu Jun’s expression remained unchanged, and his eyes were suffused with a wisp of a gloomy sheen instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Emperor Grade Abode on Vastcloud Mountain, Chen Xi was completely immersed in the inheritance from the Infinite Divine Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, the Grand Dao Laws he’d grasped were respectively the five elements, Yin, Yang, wind, lightning, star, eternal, creation, oblivion, devour, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single Grand Dao Law was capable of obtaining an inheritance from the Infinite Divine Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sort of inheritance fully displayed the supreme profundities of the Law. It was transformed into a talisman marking before condensed into sword qi with extraordinary might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But up until now, Chen Xi had only comprehended the Sword of Water and the Sword of Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sword of Fire!” Chen Xi suddenly raised his head and shouted in a low voice while his right hand formed into the shape of a sword before he pointed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strands of flames appeared in midair, yet when they floated up into the air, it seemed like an ocean of lava. Every single strand carried a violent, overbearing, raging, and unrestrained force that incinerated space and revealed numerous black holes and ripples that vanished in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the inheritance ground within the world of stars after all. The Spatial Laws here were mysterious and solid. If this move of Chen Xi’s was executed in the outside world, then it was sufficient to reveal the terrifying scene of space and the sky being incinerated and melted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s done!” Chen Xi revealed an expression of delight. “The three moves of Fireflow Incineration, Flaming Rainveil, and Sea of Flames Purgatory have been completely merged into one, and it’s might has revealed become much more formidable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like the Sword of Water, when the Sword of Fire attained perfection, all the moves it contained would merge into a single move. With a single command of the heart, every single strike one made would reveal the various variations of the Laws of Fire, and there would be no need to be restrained by specific moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve completely grasped the inheritances of water and fire but the improvement in my combat strength isn’t evident enough.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi pondered deeply. After a short moment, he stopped hesitating and immediately started comprehending the Sword of Wood, the Sword of Metal, and the Sword of Earth…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something worthy of mention was that if one wanted to obtain an inheritance from the Infinite Divine Talisman, then one had to first comprehend an inheritance to perfection before one could comprehend another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, with his experience from comprehending the Sword of Water and Sword of Fire, Chen Xi could be said to be extremely familiar towards all of this, and he became even more proficient in its comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, he’d spend an entire few months of time to comprehend the Sword of Water, yet he’d completely grasped the Sword of Fire in a little over a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was the time in the world of stars, and if it was in the outside world, then this time would be reduced by an entire five times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After fifteen days passed in the world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strand of sword qi that was filled with boundless green and hazy vitality shot into the sky. Everywhere it passed, the aura of the strike rose steadily as if its might grew stronger as time passed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perfection in the Sword of Wood, endless growth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten days later in the world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sharp rumbling that sounded like the flapping of the wings of a group of bees shook the sky and was filled with a frightening force, and then a wisp of sharp and murderous golden sword qi slashed out. With a swish, space was easily torn into two like a piece of paper!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter if it was in terms of speed, strength, or sharpness, this sword strike had attained its limits. It was condensed to the extreme, and it fully displayed the limits of the profundities of the Laws of Metal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Grand Dao of Metal was known for being murderous and sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its speed, force, and sharpness were at the top amongst the five elements. A sword strike executed with the Laws of Metal moved practically as if it was teleporting, and it was rather impossible to defend against before it arrived in a flash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perfection in the Sword of Metal, peerless slaughter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After another five days passed, Chen Xi’s entire body was suffused with a thick aura of the earth. His entire body was like a lofty mountain that had stood for countless years. Suddenly, he moved. The tip of his finger moved like a moving rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire surrounding space emanated muffled bangs as if it was being rubbed against and crushed. It was pure, thick, heavy, and power energy of the earth element, and it was converged into a single strike, causing it to be like a myriad of mountains moving with the intent of flattening the world and rebuilding the heavens and the earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perfection in the Sword of Earth, boundless weight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, he’d completely grasped the inheritances of the five elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to before, my combat strength has at least risen explosively by over two times after I comprehended the inheritances of the five elements. So long as it isn’t someone at the Golden Immortal Realm, then there’s probably no one amongst my peers who’s a match for me…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi felt refreshed as he pondered in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though I’ve still not attained the Golden Immortal Realm yet, and I’m unable to condense the Laws of the five elements into one. But I can try to overlap the inheritances of the five elements and utilize them like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Laws of the Grand Dao were overlapped, then their might would definitely overlap and rise explosively. This was an undeniable fact. For example, if the Laws of wood and fire were overlapped, then wood would help improve the might of fire, thus its might would definitely improve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, if earth and wood were overlapped, then the earth would nurture the might of wood while the wood solidified the earth. Thus, their might would overlap and increase. Of course, this wasn’t a fusion of the Laws, and it was related to the profundities of the mutual promotion and restraint of the five elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In short, if different Grand Dao Laws were combined, their might would indeed overlap with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All those years ago when Chen Xi was still at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm, he was only able to successively execute sword qi that contained the Grand Dao Laws of the five elements, whereas after he attained the intermediate-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm, he was instead able to contain the sword qi of the Laws of the five elements within a single sword strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same now. At the bottom of it all, the inheritances of the five elements improved five different Grand Dao Laws to perfection, flawlessness, and the extreme. After that, it was completely fused into the Sword Dao through the deduction of the Infinite Divine Talisman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the perfect utilization of the Laws and the Sword Dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When one’s cultivation was unable to improve in a short period of time, the improvement of one’s combat techniques would similarly be able to cause a change in one’s combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Should I comprehend the inheritance of a new Law, or should I start practicing in overlapping the inheritances of the five elements?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi pondered deeply. Comprehending the inheritance of a new law meant that he would start comprehending the inheritances of the Grand Dao Laws of Yin, Yang, wind, lightning, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, practicing in overlapping the inheritances of the five elements meant that he would practice overlapping the inheritances of the five elements in proper order. For example, combining two together, then combining pairs together… In the end, the sword qi of the five elements would be completely overlapped, and this was similarly a method to improve his combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In short, no matter if it was comprehending the inheritance of a new Law or overlapping the Laws that he’d already grasped, both of them were a path towards improving his combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Comparatively speaking, the latter’s improvement towards his combat strength was a bit more obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, there was no different in superiority between the inheritances of the Sword of Water and Sword of Fire, and it only allowed Chen Xi to grasp another technique in combat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, if he overlapped the two of them and utilized them together, their might would naturally improve greatly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looks like overlapping the sword of the five elements isn’t a bad choice…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi pondered for a long time before he decided in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right when he was about to put this decision into action, his clone suddenly sent a thought to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Someone has come to pay me a visit?” Chen Xi was stunned. He immediately stood up and left the world of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Xi walked out of his abode, he noticed from afar that a green clothed man was standing in midair with his hands behind his back while revealing a smile on the corners of his mouth. The man had a rather warm appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother Chen Xi.” When he saw Chen Xi make an appearance, the green clothed man instantly revealed a wisp of a pleasantly warm smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“May I know who Senior Brother is?” Chen Xi knew that this person was a senior student with a single look because this person wasn’t amongst those five hundred new students at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m Tang Ying.” The green clothed man smiled as he replied in a rather direct manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, it’s Senior Brother Tang Ying, may I know why you’ve come looking for me?” Chen Xi was even more puzzled in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green clothed man, Tang Ying, laughed as he said, “I’ve heard of Junior Brother Chen Xi for a long time. Not only did you obtain first place amongst the new students this time, you’re even renowned throughout the academy. Now that I’ve met you, you really do deserve your reputation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi puckered his lips and smiled because he knew that the green clothed man was engaging in small talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, Tang Ying immediately spoke frankly when he saw Chen Xi act like this. “To tell you the truth, because Junior Brother made such an extraordinary display, some other brothers of the outer court wish to spar with Junior Brother and discuss the Dao together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spar?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi thought in his heart and said, “Discussing the Dao in the Dao Development Reserve?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, the Dao Development Reserve.” Tang Ying said with a smile, “It can be considered to be a noble event in the academy because only those amongst the new students who make extraordinary displays would be invited.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi pondered briefly before he shook his head and smiled. “I’m very grateful for your kindness, Senior Brother. Unfortunately, I’m very busy, and I’m truly unable to find time to make it for this event. I hope you can forgive me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, it was already equivalent to a refusal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ying was stunned as he never expected Chen Xi to refuse so quickly, and he hurriedly said, “Junior Brother Chen Xi, will you not reconsider? So long as you obtain victory during the discussion of the Dao, you’ll be able to obtain a generous reward of Starpoints.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi shook his head and refused politely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was preparing for the inner court exam that would occur two years from now, so how could he have the time to participate in this sort of spar? Not to mention that his clone could earn Starpoints by just accepting assignments while staying within his abode. So, it was impossible for him to be convinced by Tang Ying.</span></p>
