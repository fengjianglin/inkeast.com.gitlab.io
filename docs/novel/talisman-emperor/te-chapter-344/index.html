 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi who stood casually in tattered clothes like a beggar seemed as if he was another person, with a menacing look between his brows while standing straight like a spear. At this moment, the ghastly killing intent he tempered from the countless arduous battles during these past three months had been released with a bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the entire hall seemed as if it had fallen into severe winter. The bodies of every single person froze and felt as if a sword was against their backs, and even their breathing felt difficult as they looked at Chen Xi with gazes that were filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had imagined that when this fellow who was covered in rags and blood merely released his killing intent, it would seem material and be so ghastly and fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t speak a single unnecessary word. Chen Xi had forcefully slaughtered a path of blood out of Gloom Forest, and it was a path worthy of being called a path of blood. Besides the blood of countless ferocious beasts, Chen Xi himself had already forgotten exactly how many times he was injured or how much blood he’d shed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this ceaseless battles and slaughter, Chen Xi had even grasped a completely new Dao Insight — the Grand Dao of Slaughter! At the instant he decided to enter into battle, he’d already entered into battle conditions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His feelings were indifferent like a dried up well that had no ripples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soul was highly concentrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression was icy cold and indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing his enemies in the swiftest way possible had become the one and only objective in Chen Xi’s heart, and it was a firm and pure objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the villains of the Roving Vultures noticed to their horror that Chen Xi’s figure had suddenly vanished into thin air in their field of vision, and they were unable to lock onto him any longer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu! Pu! Pu!</span></p>

A flawless string of blood appeared in the sky, and it was tragically beautiful and bloody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding spectators noticed to their horror that the throats of every single one of the seven bandits that were closest to Chen Xi had a uniform bloody hole pierced on their throats, and their expressions of shock were frozen on their faces as if they didn’t understand what had happened even until their death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing that caused the others to feel horrified the most was that due to his speed being too swift, they were utterly incapable of seeing Chen Xi’s figure clearly from the beginning until the end, let alone see how he struck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu! Pu! Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The horrifying muddled sounds resounded out once more like the footsteps of the god of death, and it stomped in the hearts of everyone, causing their entire bodies to go cold as if they’d fallen into an icy pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than an instant, another five bandits had died miserably, and the state of their death was exactly similar, a single strike to the throat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did the other bandits recover from their shock, and all of them were terrified to the point their souls almost left their bodies as they fled in all directions. At this moment, did they still seem like members of the notorious Roving Vultures? Did they still seem like ferocious villains that had tainted their hands with blood?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the eyes of Yun Na, these bandits that had caused her to have countless nightmares were now like a flock of sheep whose lair was invaded by a ferocious tiger, so helpless and so despaired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no sympathy or pity in her heart. These notorious bandits were too detestable, they specialized in robbing and killing independent cultivators who had no background and bullied the weak while fearing the strong, so they deserved death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, when she saw them fleeing for their lives, there was only happiness and excitement in her heart. If it wasn’t for her strength being insufficient, she wished for nothing more than to charge up and slaughter them without restraint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How satisfying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she recalled how she was terrified to the point of being completely helpless earlier, Yun Na felt a wave of shame. But she didn’t feel too embarrassed, because she knew that if she didn’t have this ferocious fellow, Chen Xi, by her side, everything would return to how it was in the past. At that time, she would probably be unable to escape the fiendish claws of these bandits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The will to fight of the remaining bandits collapsed as they fled with a bang, yet this was unable to make Chen Xi stop just like that. The battles during these past few years had allowed him to deeply understand a single truth, never hold back in the slightest when dealing with any enemy. One must pull out weeds by the roots and eliminate them completely, so that one could forever put an end to any future troubles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he did indeed not hold back in the slightest. In his eyes, these fellows were no different than the ferocious beasts he encountered earlier, and their deaths weren’t worthy of pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the arduous battles and tempering in these past three months, his cultivation had broken through once again. His body refinement and qi refinement had both attained the advanced-stage of the Golden Core Realm, causing his strength to be more than two times more formidable than when he was in the Gloom Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with the combat technique and will he’d tempered during the battles with those terrifying ferocious beasts, it allowed him to precisely control every single segment in the entire battle situation, and he was able to annihilate his enemies with the swiftest speed while being in a state that saved the most of his physical strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that he didn’t compare himself with others any longer, as there was utterly nothing that could be compared. People like Qing Xiuyi, Zhao Qinghe who could be called the peak experts of the younger generation of the entire Darchu Dynasty did indeed possess extremely formidable strengths, and it had even attained the limit they were capable of achieving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But up until now, even if his live combat experience had multiplied, he hadn’t arrived at his own limit. His potential was still enormous, and he had an even greater space to improve. If he was given sufficient time, then he was completely confident in surpassing all the Golden Core Realm experts of the Darchu Dynasty’s younger generation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was now, his strength was already sufficient to look down upon most of the Golden Core Realm experts of the younger generation, and if they were to compete solely on combat experience, then there was probably no one capable of achieving all the life and death battles that Chen Xi had experienced while fighting all the way to attain his current achievements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a type of extremely precious experience, because only by receiving the baptism of countless life and death battles could one truly be able to understand the meaning of battle and reveal extraordinary combat skills. This was something that couldn’t be passed down by any sect or book, and it required one to personally contemplate it and temper one’s self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, the master guides one through the entrance, yet cultivation depended on one’s self. Cultivation was like this, and so was combat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The slaughter was still being carried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrill cries resounded out successively within the hall. The shrill cries emitted before death caused every single person present at the scene to feel as if they were immersed in icy cold and bone piercing water, and they couldn’t help but start shivering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely a slaughter without suspense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When facing such a slaughter, no matter how firm their minds were, they couldn’t help but feel awe and terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the spectators were so terrified, and the villains of the Roving Vultures were even more so. Up until this point in the battle, they’d practically been beaten to a muddled state.</span></p>

Leave Fort Desolate! While there’s life, there’s still hope!”&nbsp;</span></p>

You must possess a certain level of strength, otherwise, you will only be kicked out, and in some serious cases, it’s even possible to be killed!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
