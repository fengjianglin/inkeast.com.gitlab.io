Quickly fuck off to the side. I want to challenge this ignorant bastard!” A robust man parted the crowd and glared fiercely at Liang Liang in a threatening manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Liang chuckled and said, “You look like an extraordinary figure on first glance. But are you sure that your rankings on the Continental Ascensio Rankings surpass my Young Master?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The robust man’s face froze before he said fiercely, “What?

Don’t put on an act if you don’t have the qualifications. Move aside now, don’t affect the others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The robust man’s expression turned grim as he pointed at Liang Liang. “You dog!

You think there’s no one capable in my Liang Clan?” Liang Zhen suddenly turned around with a gaze that was icy cold like a blade, and he looked over coldly. He was handsome, proud, and revealed the bearing of an expert, and coupled with the Liang Clan’s name, he possessed an extremely deterring force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The robust man’s face changed once more, and his imposing aura instantly weakened before he muttered angrily as he turned around and entered the crowd.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, why don’t I play with Young Master Chen Xi?” Meanwhile, a voice that was sweet to the bone sounded out, and then a graceful figure walked out of the crowd to appear before everyone’s field of vision. Her tight light violet colored palace clothes vividly drew out the curves of her body, and her ample chest was almost on the verge of breaking open from the comforts of her clothes, causing her to reveal an expanse of snow white skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her hair was coiled up high above her head, revealing her snow white long neck, and a faint smile that was filled with allure hung on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman was like a tender and beautiful wild rose. She was warm, bold, and capable of melting one’s bones. The gazes of many experts started burning while some of the women in the crowd were filled with hostility, and all of them cursed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Siren!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Liang Liang started drooling from this sight while his wretched eyes glowed. He swiftly took a few hard glances at her tempting peaks like a hungry wolf, and he seemed as wretched as wretched could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist from the Liang Clan, your gaze is really scary.” The charming woman glanced at Liang Liang while her brows knit together slightly, and she had a misty gaze while she slightly straightened her body, causing the snow white lumps before her chest to shake and be filled with allure. It caused all the people present to feel their mouths go dry while their vital blood roiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Liang’s breathing became heavy while blood almost sprayed from his nose, and he hurriedly chuckled and said, “So it’s the Illusory Water City’s Young Miss Nan Biyun. With Miss Nan’s combat strength at the two hundred and thirty sixth position and coupled with your peerlessly ingenuine immortal charm techniques, what would you be afraid of? It’s not like it’s possible for me to eat you up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he casually raised his sleeve to wipe off his saliva, and his movements were natural and skilled, yet his innate wretched aura couldn’t be concealed no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was moved when he heard this, and he faintly felt that Liang Liang seemed to be exposing some information related to this woman to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal charm techniques?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like she’s skilled in shapeless attacks to the mind…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Liang Zhen glanced at Chen Xi who was on the arena, and then Chen Xi stood up and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go ahead.” Liang Zhen turned around and glanced coldly at Nan Biyun when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, what a handsome Big Brother. If it wasn’t for the sake of sparring with Young Master Chen Xi, I would really like to buy you a drink.” Nan Biyun smiled delicately at Liang Zhen with watery eyes that seemed as if they would overflow at any moment. It caused all the surrounding experts to swallow a mouthful of saliva in secret while their hearts burned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She really is a siren that’ll charm to death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, Nan Biyun had flown up lightly onto the arena, and her figure swayed while her beautiful eyes flowed with light as they glanced ceaselessly at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master Chen Xi, I actually don’t want to fight you, and I just want to get to know you. Perhaps we’ll even be able to form some goodwill between us. So let me win later, alright?” She suddenly blinked her eyes while revealing pity and charm, and she was like a little beast that was flattering and begging for mercy from her master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Chen Xi answered without any hesitation, and it was calm and direct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Biyun’s eyes instantly turned red while she revealed a wronged appearance. She stood there timidly while her fine and dense jet black eyelashes trembled slightly. It seemed as if tears were on the verge of falling from her eyes, and she didn’t seem like she’d come to do battle at all. She seemed like a lovesick young girl that had come to find her perfect match instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s aura suddenly rose violently like a tempestuous wave that grew higher and higher. In the blink of an eye, it surged like an ocean, and then he didn’t hesitate in the slightest to slap out with his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the instant she stepped onto the arena, this woman had utilized charm techniques, and every single word she uttered carried a shapeless and immaterial force that invaded the heart, causing it to be impossible to guard against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Chen Xi was unable to avoid this sort of shapeless attack, and numerous illusions instantly surged into his mind. There were charming and tender women that wore light gauze clothes that faintly revealed their skin dancing about while whispering lightly with voices that were deeply moving; there was a charming scene of song and dance slowly playing out in an extravagant surrounding that was extraordinarily luxurious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was any other Heavenly Immortal Realm expert, then it would be impossible for the expert to protect his Dao Heart. The expert would probably be deeply moved, causing their vital blood to roil. Unfortunately, all of this was useless against Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Dao Heart cultivation had attained the Heart Soul Realm a long time ago. It was strong as steel and untainted by anything. So using illusions against him was utterly futile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Chen Xi made a move resolutely while his gaze was clear and firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Biyun seemed to have been shocked and actually didn’t dodge. She raised her peaks high and moved towards Chen Xi’s palm attack. This movement of hers almost caused her ample snow white peaks to break out of her clothes, and they were suffused with a charming glow that was dazzling like ivory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene even caused the blood of the experts in the surroundings to surge, and their eyeballs almost fell out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged when he saw this. Not only did he not stop, the might of his palm rose explosively instead, and it carried the might of a storm as it directly smashed down onto Nan Biyun’s ample peaks!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strike was so resolute, direct, and decisive that it had absolutely exceeded Nan Biyun’s expectations. Never had she imagined that the young man before her wouldn’t just not be charmed by her, he would even attack so ruthlessly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The palm tore through the sky and arrived before her. Before it could even touch her body, the coil of hair above Nan Biyun’s head exploded open, causing her hair to become disheveled while her countenance turned slightly pale. Moreover, the winds emanated from this palm was so fierce and swift that it caused her face to hurt slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

It directly broke through her defenses and charged towards her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strand of blood immediately overflowed from the corner of Nan Biyun’s mouth while her entire body was blasted back uncontrollably. She directly fell outside the arena with a dejected expression and a beautiful face that had turned pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi could be said to have won this first match in an extremely easy manner. Nan Biyun hadn’t had the chance to execute any trump card at all before she was forcefully blasted off the arena. It was truly an astounding sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, no one had imagined that this battle would end so quickly and so suddenly. Perhaps, no one had imagined that Chen Xi would actually be indifferent towards such a delicate beauty and directly attack so ruthlessly. He didn’t even hesitate in the slightest, and this completely exceeded the expectation of all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow! No wonder he dared to challenge Young Miss Yin Miaomiao! He really is a freak with a warped mind! He doesn’t even know how to be tender towards beauties!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes everyone shot at Chen Xi more or less carried a wisp of a strange expression. They were very well aware that so long as Chen Xi hesitated in the slightest, then the outcome of this battle might have been completely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, Nan Biyun who’d subdued countless experts by relying on her charm techniques had finally failed today, and she’d lost at the hands of a freak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a pity…</span></p>

Nan Biyun was able to rely on her charm techniques to become ranked at the two hundred and twenty sixth on the Continental Ascensio Rankings, so her strength was naturally unquestionably strong. However, she’d lost because she was too confident of her charm techniques, and it caused her to be unable to exert her strength before falling in defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a ruthless fellow. Just you fucking wait!” Nan Biyun let out a sharp cry that was filled with hatred, and then she flashed and vanished on the spot. Obviously, she felt that she’d really disgraced herself today. She was unable to exert her strength properly before her opponent had seized the opportunity to catch her off-guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t be bothered about this. He directly tossed these threats to the back of his mind because a loss was a loss. There was no luck involved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others felt that the match had ended too suddenly, whereas he felt this battle was slightly boring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk, this woman has such a fierce character, but I like it.” Liang Liang sighed while revealing an unfulfilled appearance. But in the eyes of everyone, they felt this fellow had become more and more wretched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! An unfair victory. Aren’t you ashamed? I’ll be the next person to challenge you.” Right at this moment, a gloomy voice resounded while a young man that was enveloped in blazing and surging flames that caused others to be unable to see his face clearly walked out of the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I ask who you are?” Liang Liang’s pupils constricted, and he seemed to have recognized this person yet didn’t dare confirm it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yin Wanfeng,” said the young man in an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of surprise appeared on Liang Liang’s thin and wretched face, and he cried out. “Yin Wanfeng that’s ranked at the hundred and ninety ninth position?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the nearby experts were shocked in their hearts.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that the Yin Clan’s experts are already unable to restrain themselves from making a move?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man just raised his head proudly when facing all of this, and he crossed his arms before his chest while remaining silent. All he did was stare coldly at Chen Xi who was on the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the proud and cold Liang Zhen frowned slightly before he opened his right hand and gestured at Yin Wanfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?” Yin Wanfeng was stunned and slightly puzzled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What does he want? Could it be that he wants to talk to me in private and prohibit me from challenging Chen Xi? How could that be possible!?</span></p>

Didn’t you see the words written on the banner? What’re you still standing there for?! Quickly hand over ten thousand immortal stones! Don’t waste everyone’s time, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin Wanfeng’s face instantly flushed red like the blazing flames that surrounded his body.
