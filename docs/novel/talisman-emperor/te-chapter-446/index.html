They wore worn out armor and held bronze halberds, and talisman markings flickered on the halberds that emitted a sharp aura and light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Particularly, there were actually a pair of pitch black wings on their backs that allowed them to freely and nimbly move about within the tempest, and they emitted the aura of Necro Baleful Qi that caused one’s heart to palpitate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out, these are Necro Fish Demons, and they’re one of the comparatively stronger races of sea demons in the Primitive Sea. They’re capable of flying in the sky and diving into the sea, and their strengths are comparable to Golden Core Realm cultivators, causing them to be the most difficult to kill.” Huangfu Qingying warned them right away when she saw the army of fish demons that emerged from the distance tempest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These Necro Fish Demons are skilled in the Dao Insights of Wind and Water. Moreover, the Origin Pearls condensed within their bodies are greatly beneficial towards our cultivation of the Wind and Water Dao Insights.” Leng Qianqiu spoke as she swung out the bone chain in her hand to transform into a rainbow that traversed the sky before directly blasting into the army of Necro Fish Demons and fiercely mincing them apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the bodies of over 100 Necro Fish Demons exploded apart, causing over 100 glittering and translucent jet black pearls to be swept into Leng Qianqiu’s hand by the bone chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Human cultivators!”</span></p>

Hahaha! We can finally eat fresh human meat!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sharp and ear piercing howl suddenly sounded out from within the group of Necro Fish Demons, and it surged with killing intent as it resounded out in the heavens and the earth. These sea demons were already no different than ordinary Golden Core Realm cultivators and possessed high intelligence, so they knew how to work together in battle. In the next moment, they’d already joined forces to launch a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amazing, they actually already know how to utilize formations in their combat tactics. But, this formation is too shoddy. If it was I who managed the formation, then I would at least be able to bring forth ten times more might from it…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he shook his head before directly circulating the Stellar Lightningform and smashing out with his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his fist struck out, countless thunderstorm vortexes formed and transformed into a stream of vortexes, and it hit the center of the formation formed by the army of Necro Fish Demons. Instantly, the formation collapsed with a bang, and numerous Necro Fish Demons were instantly crushed into powder, whereas their enormous Blood Essence, demonic qi, and their numerous Origin Pearls were swept into the thunderstorm vortexes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Devouring the heavens and the earth to transform everything to become useful to me. This Divine Ability Third Senior Brother created is really formidable!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi praised endlessly in his heart. The Blood Essence and demonic qi of these fish demons were swallowed into his body before a strand of a warm flow instantly moved within his body, and it immediately replenished all the Shaman Energy he’d used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This effect of refining Blood Essence and demonic qi to become useful to Chen Xi and replenish his Shaman Energy was simply heaven defying. Even though it didn’t provide the slightest benefit to Chen Xi’s cultivation, so long as he was able to devour sufficient Blood Essence and demonic qi, then he would be able to cause his Shaman Energy to become boundless. When he fought, he would simply be no different than an inexhaustible machine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the Origin Pearls of the fish demons contained a trace of the energy of Wind and Water Dao Insight, and its value was comparable to Dao Grade spirit herbs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the strengths of these fish demons were comparable to Golden Core Realm cultivators, and their Origin Pearls were similar to the golden core of Golden Core Realm cultivators, so its value was naturally shocking to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">320 Origin Pearls… My pockets are completely dried up and squeaky clean. Even though the value of these Origin Pearls is impossible to determine, but if I gather a lot more, they would surely be a considerable amount of wealth.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi briefly sized them up before placing the Origin Pearls into the Buddha’s Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the others had successively attacked with their full strengths and started to hunt these Necro Fish Demons. The value of the Origin Pearls of these fish demons was so great, and they knew in their hearts that it was absolutely a shocking amount of wealth. In the outside world, it was utterly impossible to encounter such a massive amount of sea demons that one could willfully hunt and kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such fortune could only be encountered in the Primeval Battlefield’s Primitive Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill!” Divine light flashed through the sky and Dao Insight surged, and various attacks covered the heavens and the earth with mighty impetus. Wave after wave of Necro Fish Demons were annihilated like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single person within their group was one of the top genius experts in the world. Moreover, their cultivations, martial techniques, and magic treasures were far from something these fish demons could compare to. So once they started slaughter with their full strength, the scene was absolutely one where they swept through the fist demons like sweeping away dead leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the most striking amongst them was Chen Xi. Every single time he attacked caused him to seem like a ball of surging thunderstorm that exploded apart and caused countless streams of vortexes to envelop out. Every single thunderstorm vortex seemed to transform into a bloody mouth that swept out to devour everything in the surroundings, and in the time of only a few breaths, an entire 10,000 plus fish demons was completely devoured by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, the others were utterly not in time to make a move as the fish demons would already be completely wiped out by Chen Xi. He simply seemed to have transformed into an extremely ferocious swarm of locusts that didn’t leave anything behind in his wake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly what Divine Ability is this? It’s so ferocious!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! This kid is too ruthless. He isn’t even leaving any scraps for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do? We can’t win against him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this scene, Pei Yu and the others were shocked, envious, and in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to normal logic, even a top expert at the Golden Core Realm was unable to slaughter tens of thousands of Necro Fish Demons in a short period of time, and a cultivator would only be able to so casually achieve this if the cultivator possessed a formidable magic treasure like a Quasi Immortal Artifact or had surpassed the Golden Core Realm,&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi had exploded out repeatedly instead with a shocking Divine Ability that allowed him to kill group after group of Necro Fish Demons in the time of a few breaths. Moreover, not only did his aura not seem to weaker, he seemed to grow stronger as he battled, and this scene that went against common sense was something that no one would dare believe to be real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen’s display is too dazzling. It looks to me like those fellows have aroused killing intent towards Brother Chen.” Young Master Zhou’s eyes glanced at the expression of Pei Yu and the others before he swiftly sent a voice transmission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine. The stronger Chen Xi is, the more valuable he is to Pei Yu. At this moment, he would absolutely not make a move against Chen Xi.” Huangfu Qingying spoke with a calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about in the future?” Young Master Zhou asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the future?” A wisp of coldness arose on the corners of Huangfu Qingying’s mouth. “Who knows who will be using who in the future. With Chen Xi’s intelligence, he’ll surely be able to easily deal with all of this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Daoist Brother Pei, this group of Necro Fish Demons have been completely annihilated. We should swiftly carry on with our journey.” Chen Xi’s indifferent and calm voice sounded out from far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Brother Chen is formidable. I have no choice but to admire you. In the next part of our journey, so long as Brother Chen is present, then no matter what ferocious sea demon appears, would we have to fear anything?” Pei Yu was jolted awake from his thoughts, and his expression went serious before he squeezed out a warm smile. However, in the next moment, the smile on his face had already froze abruptly, and his expression revealed rare heaviness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because another tempest of sea demons had swept over from where the sky was connected with the sea, and the sea demons in the tempest were actually 30m tall terrifying violent apes that possessed dense fur and sharp fangs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out! These are Violent Waterflame Apes, and they’re one of the strongest type of sea demons in the Primitive Sea. They possess violent natures, are skilled in the profundities of the Water and Fire Dao Insights, and they possess boundless physical strength. They’re far from something the Necro Fish Demons can compare to. Amongst the genius experts that entered the Primitive Sea in the past, most of them fell beneath the army of Violent Waterflame Apes!” Pei Yu shouted out loudly with an extremely heavy expression, and he didn’t have the slightest relaxed expression any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>

After all, the imposing aura of the tempest that assaulted them this time was too mighty and shocking, and they were utterly unable to overlook it.</span></p>

Merely the fierce demonic qi they emitted condensed into a pitch black cloud of demonic qi that covered an area of 500km, and it roiled ceaselessly and possessed a shocking impetus.</span></p>

Moreover, every single one emitted an aura that wasn’t inferior to an advanced-stage Golden Core Realm cultivator, causing them to virtually seem like an extremely shocking flood of forces.</span></p>

But, when it was 10,000 or 100,000 of sea demons like this, the sea demons were sufficient to tear any one of them into pieces!</span></p>

All of them were 30m in height and possessed violent auras, and they were like numerous giants of the sea that invaded and plundered the sea with overwhelming force.</span></p>

Even if Chen Xi was extremely confident of his current strength, he didn’t dare rashly charged in when facing a situation like this.</span></p>

These stupid humans are dreaming of seizing wealth on the Primitive Sea while tempering their cultivations again, and they even want to go search for the Isle of Fallen Treasures. They really are reckless.”</span></p>

Those that are able to enter the Primeval Battlefield are geniuses with the highest natural talents amongst humans. They possess shocking wealth and countless magic treasures, medicinal pills, and cultivation techniques. It’s just nice for us to seize it and use it for ourselves.”</span></p>

The bodies of these Violent Waterflame Apes were either coiled with raging flames or surging and vast streams of water. One flame and one water, all in groups of two, and they revealed formidable control of the Dao Insights of water and fire.</span></p>
