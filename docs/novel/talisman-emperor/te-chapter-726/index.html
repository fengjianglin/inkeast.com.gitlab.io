The straight and broad streets in the city were constructed from Levitational Rocks that were smooth like mirrors, and they were covered in a layer of clouds, causing it to feel dreamlike as one walked on its streets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Taotie City was the ‘Capital of Delicacies’ that was renowned in the world, and it gathered all the delicacies in the world. There were various ingredients from all over being transported into the city at practically every single moment, and after being cooked by the spirit chefs within the city, they became the numerous delicacies with special flavors on the dining tables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, along with the approach of the Spirit Chef Gold Rankings, this capital of delicacies had become even more bustling and streaming with people, and the streets were almost filled with people. Some were cultivators from all over that had come to witness the grand event out of admiration, and some were first-rate spirit chefs that had come from far and wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi and the others stepped foot into the city, it seemed as if they’d entered another world, and clamorous waves of noise assaulted their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strands of a variety of tempting fragrances suffused the air like an expanse of fermented clouds and mist, causing one’s spirits to be refreshed and appetite to be aroused upon smelling it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streets in the city were extremely broad and filled with stalls on both sides. Behind the stalls were numerous spirit chefs that were cooking delicacies with skilled movements, whereas the people on the streets were mostly converged before every single stall and were tasting the delicacies while singing waves of praise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Finecloud Stall’s Flaming Skewers are really superb! The texture of the meat is charred on the outside and tender on the inside, and it’s oily yet not greasy. The rarest part of it all was that it carried the pungent taste of Jade Turnip Spice. Oh, its taste is too good!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Fragrant Turmeric Stall’s Nine Treasure Spirit Cake is even better. It’s sweet, sticky, crispy, and smooth. It carries both the freshness of Azure Duckweed and the rich taste of Silver Poria. Even my tongue melts along with it once it’s in my mouth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come, come, come! Come taste this Clear Maroon Fruit Wine. It was personally brewed by Master Mei after gathering over a thousand spirit fruits and sealed within an icy pit for a hundred years, and it has only been unsealed today. It has a mellow and rich taste, and it’s said that even an immortal would be intoxicated by three cups of it. It’s a precious and superb wine that’s hard to come by.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clamorous noise filled the streets while cultivators formed groups of two or three as they enjoyed the delicacies and savored the superb wine before the numerous stalls with relaxed and carefree bearings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The luxurious scene that was covered with delicacies caused even Chen Xi to feel it was too much for his eyes to take in, and he was greatly interested. Most importantly, the delicacies before those stalls were actually provided for free tastings!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What extravagance!</span></p>

After all, those delicacies weren’t ordinary dishes, and every single one of them were comparable to spirit medicines and possessed miraculous effects, causing them to be expensive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, they were actually given for free to the passing people in Taotie Street to taste, and ordinary powers were utterly unable to endure such an expense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, there’s so much good food!” The nearby A’xiu’s eyes lit up while she stared fixedly at a golden yellow skewer of roast meat, and a trace of crystalline saliva overflowed from the red and moist corners of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wore a green dress, possessed a graceful figure, and had a gorgeous and exquisite appearance. At this moment, her appearance of a little glutton didn’t arouse dislike in others but revealed a tender and cute feeling instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She shook Chen Xi’s sleeve. “Let’s start eating as well. I want to eat for three days and three nights!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, the people the passed by nearby were instantly astounded, and they looked at A’xiu with strange expressions. It was truly difficult for them to imagine that such a lofty proclamation was spoken by a beautiful and cute young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A’xiu didn’t care instead, and she ran over happily to a stall and snapped her finger before she said in a clear voice, “Shopkeeper, give me 10 meat skewers! Right, you didn’t hear me wrongly. It isn’t one but 10!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh, Young Miss, you really have a good appetite.” The shopkeeper couldn’t help but grin from amusement but still passed over a bunch of skewers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, how would I be able to eat for three days and three nights if my appetite isn’t good?” The corners of A’xiu’s mouth curled up, and she revealed an aura of arrogance as if she could devour all of it in a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shopkeeper was astounded and looked at Chen Xi as if he was saying.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master, this female companion of yours is too abnormal, right?</span></p>

He walked forward and took hold of A’xiu’s hand before walking forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey! Hey! What are you pulling me along for?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rest for a while. No one is allowed to leave without my permission!” Chen Xi glared at A’xiu, and he warned fiercely before turning around and returning to his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This courtyard was extremely large. There were artificial mountains and rivers, pavilions, and everything one could ask for. It was a courtyard specially prepared by Taotie City for the spirit chefs that were participating in the Spirit Chef Gold Rankings, so only those that possessed a Nine-Profundity Token could reside within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi started to carefully read the jade slip in his hand upon returning to his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was given to him by a servant of the Taotie Clan upon moving in to this courtyard, and it recorded the procedures and rules related to the Spirit Chef Gold Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the jade slip, the Spirit Chef Gold Rankings this time would have 3,000 spirit chefs from all over the Dark Reverie competing in it, and every single spirit chef was around the level of seven leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rules of the competition were extremely simple as well. It was divided into three rounds. Spirit chefs only had to cook a dish and pass it to the corresponding servant for the first round, and the servant would send it to Taotie Palace. At that time, the great spirit chefs of the Taotie Clan would taste these dishes one by one and select 100 spirit chefs to advance to the next round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the second round, those 100 spirit chefs that had been selected would be invited to Taotie Palace, and they would cook different dishes according to the various topics given to them. The 10 most outstanding people would remain while the remaining people would be eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third round was the final round. At that time, that Taotie Clan’s divine artifact — The Nine-Profundity Immortal Wok would make an appearance in Taotie Palace as well, and it would judge the top three spirit chefs along with three other seniors from the Taotie Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rewards for the Spirit Chef Gold Ranking this time was extremely generous as well. For example, not only would the first three obtain a strand of Goldblaze Flame, they would even be able to obtain a gift from the Nine-Profundity Immortal Wok.</span></p>

After all, it was an Immortal Artifact that had existed since the primeval times until this day, and its Artifact Spirit had lived for countless years. It possessed a respected status and identity to the point that even Heavenly Immortals probably had to be courteous when meeting it!</span></p>
