If it wasn’t for Chen Xi being a disciple of the same sect, he truly wished for nothing more than to smack the bastard to death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a top figure amongst the Seed Disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, when had he been schemed against by another?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He simply fucking ordered me about like a hired thug!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Zhenbei was angered to the point his fury boiled, and he vented his bellyful of rage onto his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His figure moved like a swimming dragon through the surroundings, and he was overbearing and dominating. He fully displayed all the abilities he’d cultivated, causing every single move he made to be filled with an extremely violent and piercingly cold aura, and he simply seemed capable of tearing the world apart and crushing the sun and moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the gaunt young man from the Wyrmshark Devil Isle possessed four times combat strength, how could he be a match for a formidable figure like Long Zhen Bei? He fell into a disadvantaged position at the instant the battle started, and he was beaten to the point of retreating repeatedly. He could only defend himself from a passive position, and his sorry state was only lacking him throwing his arms over his head and fleeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Zhenbei was aggrieved yet the gaunt young man was actually even more aggrieved than Long Zhenbei. He originally thought he would only be dealing with Chen Xi, yet never had he imagined that someone would interfere halfway with attacks that were like a fierce storm and seem to be fighting desperately. Long Zhenbei simply seemed to have taken the gaunt young man to be the enemy that had killed his father, and it caused the gaunt young man to feel like crying, but he had no tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Motherfucker! Who did I fucking offend? I just came to take revenge for my junior brothers, and I didn’t come to put my life on the line? Fucking hell! Your Nine Radiance Sword Sect is too overbearing…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gaunt young man’s expression was extremely unsightly, and he was depressed to the point of being on the verge of spitting blood. If he knew since the beginning that the opponent was an outstanding disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, then he would have utterly not come!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now he was caught and bashed violently. Not only was he unable to take revenge, but he’d also probably lose half his life in the process, and whether he could escape with his life was problem…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them had different thoughts, yet were similarly aggrieved and furious, and they vented all their bellyful of resentment onto their opponents. When this entered into the eyes of the others, the battle between the two was extremely intense and wonderful, causing everyone to exclaim with enjoyment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the surroundings of the highest floor of the Ice Cloud Pavilion was covered in countless restrictions, there was no need to worry that the battle between the two would destroy the place where they resided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that for the sake of allowing both of them to fight freely, everyone in the hall consciously retreated to the side and emptied out a vast space that allowed both of them to fight to their heart’s content.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, Long Zhenbei is worthy of being called a peerless figure from the Serpent Dragon Clan. His Dao Arts are exquisite and profound, his imposing aura shot into the sky like a rainbow, and his strength is sufficient for him to gain a leading position amongst those of the younger generation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah. Chen Xi’s natural talent is already sufficiently shocking, yet Long Zhenbei seems to be even stronger, and it’s simply the fortune of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect to possess such figures.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha! Look at that expert from the Wyrmshark Devil Isle. He came over menacingly earlier, yet has been beaten to the point of throwing his arms over his head and fleeing, and he doesn’t look the slightest bit arrogant any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone commented about the battle from every aspect because being able to witness such a brilliant battle before entering the Dark Parasol’s Abyss was able to help them kill time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gaunt young man was stifled once more when he saw this scene, and the veins on his forehead bulged while a tempestuous storm surged in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Motherfucker, don’t all of you see that I’m being fucking bashed? Not only do all of you not try to mediate, yet are helping him victimize me. How could all of you behave like this!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he was on the verge of tears while his intestines had gone green with regret.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I shouldn’t have come, I shouldn’t have come!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, after he heard these discussions, Long Zhenbei’s expression had gradually brightened up as a wisp of a prideful expression even suffused the space between his brows. Because everyone present was a top figure within the various powers and being able to obtain their praise caused him to be extremely comfortable in his heart. Moreover, the aggrieved and depressed feeling he had from before had unknowingly become much lighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! You dare think my Nine Radiance Sword Sect has no one capable? I’ll give you a memory you’re unable to forget for your entire lifetime!” He attacked more and more fiercely while his aura grew in ferocity, and he felt even more complacent in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed as if he’d taken his opponent to be the stepping stone for himself to make a show of strength, and he wanted to display his might and dignity with this. Sure enough, he obtained waves of cheering from everyone in the hall during this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Long Zhenbei to feel even more delighted in his heart, and it was even to the extent he started to think of how good Chen Xi was.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for this bastard giving me such an opportunity to enter the limelight, how could I mercilessly and freely bash this fellow even when he’s down?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought of Chen Xi, he inadvertently glanced at Chen Xi out of the corner of his eye, yet he noticed that Chen Xi was watching the battle with a smile and was frequently nodding with praise. Moreover, Chen Xi had a carefree attitude as if he was watching a show at its climax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A show?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the light smile of Chen Xi’s face, the complacency in Long Zhenbei’s heart vanished suddenly for no reason, and he instantly felt extremely terrible. He suddenly realized that he was like a monkey that was performing without sparing any effort and was jumping up and down just for the sake of the claps and cheers of the spectators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi was like the showman that planned the entire show…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, the corners of Long Zhenbei’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch fiercely while he felt like a million of fucks were whistling through his heart and surging endlessly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dammit! Bastard! This fellow is playing tricks on me like a monkey!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the rage in his heart, he unconsciously started striking even more ruthlessly, and it struck his opponent to the point of coughing up blood without end while letting out successive shrill cries of pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the hall didn’t know Long Zhenbei’s thoughts at this moment, and they instantly let out a wave of cheers when they saw him actually put on a great display of martial prowess and bash the expert from the Wyrmshark Devil Isle like a dead dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, when the praise of everyone entered into Long Zhenbei’s ears, it was so ear piercing like numerous blades that fiercely pierced into his heart, causing his heart to be on the verge of bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Played like a monkey… Played like a monkey…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words were like a curse that surged endlessly within his mind, and it provoked him to the point his heart felt as if it was being sliced apart by blades, causing him to explode with rage and wish for nothing more than to roar at the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the force of his attacks grew more and more ferocious and overbearing, and it carried an imposing aura of annihilating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the gaunt young man was unable to resist any longer, and blood sprayed from his mouth as he flew out backwards. His face warped hideously as he roared. “Fuck your mother! It’s just a battle yet you actually struck so ruthlessly. Nine Radiance Sword Sect? I don’t give a fuck, I’ll fucking fight you to the end today, Bastard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he’d already started roaring like a mad tiger and charged forward once more, and he seemed as if he was ready to put his life on the line and was fearless of injury for the sake of bringing Long Zhenbei down with him.</span></p>

Up until this point in the battle, the gaunt young man had been suppressed successively in front of everyone, and he was already fuming with rage and lost all hope, so he intended to put his life on the line.</span></p>

You actually dare to curse at me?” Long Zhenbei’s mind droned as he stared, his eyes wide open with rage. Since he’d made a name for himself, it was the first time he’d heard someone dare to direct such dirty curses at him, and it infuriated him to the point flames raged in his chest and he decided to annihilate this person to make an example for others.</span></p>

This was the first time since he started cultivating that he’d encountered such a situation. He wasn’t worried about the trouble the death of his opponent would cause him but was slightly vigilant towards himself. Because if a flaw appeared in his Dao Heart, then it would be greatly harmful to his cultivation.</span></p>

It was like an extremely ordinary and trivial matter that was unable to draw their attention any longer.</span></p>

There were countless incidents of bloodshed in the Dark Reverie every single day, and these experts of the various powers that had experienced countless battles were already accustomed to the occurrence of such incidents, so they wouldn’t pay too much attention to it unless the party that died was an extremely extraordinary figure. But it was exceedingly obvious that this gaunt young man wasn’t one.</span></p>
