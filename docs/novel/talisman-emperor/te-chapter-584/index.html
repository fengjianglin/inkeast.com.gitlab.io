Moreover, the Rebirth Wheel that floated within his Dantian was resplendent and had already transformed to possess five colors, and it flickered with auspicious rays of light while suffused with a glassy and dreamlike sheen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, a black and white qi flowed at the center of the Rebirth Wheel while cooperating with each other from a distance, and they were like the pure and turbid qi of the heavens and the earth circulating over and over again in an extremely profound manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these were the signs of the perfection-stage of the Rebirth Realm.</span></p>

Every single move he made caused the aura of the Dao to flow and emit the rumbling of its tune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, the airflow caused by every breath he took was like an enormous dragon howling, and it carried a vast and powerful force. It was even to the extent that even his hair was tough and flexible to the extreme and were suffused with a hazy light, and a Rebirth Realm cultivator could only dream of cutting it off even if the cultivator chopped his hair madly.</span></p>

Along with the advancement of one’s cultivation, besides requiring a solid foundation and deep cultivation, the surmounting of every single realm also required luck.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of ‘enlightenment’ would perhaps be created from a sudden inspiration, a sudden stroke of fortune that was natural and achieved without effort, comprehended while in battle, or from sudden understanding attained from timely advice from a senior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Chen Xi’s cultivation had already attained a flawless state, and his Dao Foundation was already extremely solid. What he lacked was ‘enlightenment.’</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along his path of cultivation until now, he’d practically relied on himself to search for the way and attain his current level of cultivation. If it was in terms of experience in the obtaining of ‘enlightenment,’ then he absolutely surpassed everyone greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the extremely miraculous visualization technique, the Fuxi Divine Statue, existed within his sea of consciousness, whereas the infant divine beast Pixiu that was capable of converging the karmic luck of the heavens and the earth was present by his side. So there was utterly no need for him to search throughout the world to find the good luck needed to be ‘enlightened’ and advance, and he only had to meditate and cultivate to naturally and smoothly advance in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Chen Xi didn’t advance his cultivation impatiently and started to study his technique instead with the intention of improving his combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the battle with Du Xuan and witnessing the formidableness of Dao Arts, he deeply understood that he was already unable to bring forth an even more formidable combat strength by relying on the martial techniques he possessed now, and it was even to the extent that these martial techniques restrained his performance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Dao Arts were different. They were superior to martial techniques and possessed peerlessly formidable might, and Du Xuan was only able to annihilate a Nether Transformation Realm cultivator because he’d grasped a Dao Art called the Profound Qi Instakill Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to what Madman Liu said, martial techniques were the foundation of all Dao Arts, whereas Dao Arts were the abilities that one required to head on the path towards becoming an immortal because the energy grasped by Heavenly Immortals were formed from Dao Arts, and they were called Laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, according to what Dao Lotus said, if he was able to control a complete Grand Dao profundity after he advanced into the Nether Transformation Realm, then he would be able to exert double the might of a Dao Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was able to control two complete Grand Dao profundities, then he would be able to exert three times his combat strength, and so on and so forth. The more complete Grand Dao profundities he controlled, his combat strength would multiply accordingly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other sects that were slightly inferior might possess Dao Art inheritances as well, yet they were extremely rare like qilin horns and phoenix feathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, as one of the 10 great immortal sects of the Dark Reverie and an extraordinary power, besides all those ordinary Dao Art inheritances, the Nine Radiance Sword Sect only possessed a mere few tens of top Dao Art inheritances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, if one wanted to obtain these Dao Arts, one had to comprehend them on the nine layers of the lotus platform, and it was absolutely not something one could possess at will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, all the Elite Disciples Chen Xi had encountered in all the nine layers of the lotus platform earlier formed an extremely enormous number, but the disciples that were able to comprehend and master a Dao Art were only a mere few.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, Du Xuan had only obtained a single Dao Art, the Profound Qi Instakill Technique, from the lotus platform, but even then, it allowed his combat strength to rise explosively and be ranked amongst the five great Elite Disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious from this how difficult it was to obtain a Dao Art, and exactly how formidable the might of a Dao Art was after it was grasped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Chen Xi didn’t lack Dao Arts, and it was even to the extent that the amount of Dao Arts he’d obtained and the level of their quality could be said to be absolutely capable of being the best in the entire Nine Radiance Sword Sect. Even those higher-ups and great figures of the sect didn’t have the fate to encounter these Dao Arts.</span></p>

He sometimes exclaimed with admiration, frowned sometimes, or muttered sometimes, and he himself didn’t know he was doing this as he’d become completely oblivious to himself.</span></p>
