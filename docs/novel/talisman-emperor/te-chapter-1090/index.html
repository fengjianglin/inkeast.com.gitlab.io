Instantly refining over a hundred of these was already the limit to ordinary body refiners, and any more than that might cause the expert to suffer from qi deviation and explode from the pent up energy.</span></p>

Under such circumstances, no matter how many bloodsoul stones he consumed, it was unable to shake Chen Xi’s foundation at all, so he naturally didn’t have to worry about facing any danger.</span></p>

It started to rampage about through his skin, flesh, bones, and tendons. Everywhere it passed, his meridians, apertures, bones, and tendons felt as if they were sliced open by numerous little blades, causing violent pain to pass through his entire body.</span></p>

Under the guidance of his formidable Divine Sense, strands of Immortal Shaman Energy started circulating along the passageways in his body.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that the blood in his body started emanating the profound aura of the Dao!</span></p>

His vital blood was boiling to the extreme while even every single inch of skin, tendons, and bones were dyed with a layer of a translucent and crystalline sheen, and they emanated a clinging and pleasant tune that was like the sound of nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the Immortal Shaman Energy that surged like an ocean was still circulating and strengthening. It was improving explosively at every single moment, and it because of the energy that came from the bloodsoul stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire tempering process continued for an entire three months!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if everything had returned to extreme silence.</span></p>

He was completely unaware of everything that occurred in his surroundings.</span></p>

It was like the roar of a Fiendgod and the cheer of the Grand Dao, and it roused the deaf, enlightened the blind, and struck straight at one’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s main body that was sitting cross-legged at the side suddenly opened his eyes. When he saw the vast phenomenon created by his clone, he couldn’t help but feel a wisp of excitement in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ve finally succeeded…</span></p>

At this moment, Chen Xi was able to sense that his entire soul felt as if it was being cleansed by clear spring water, causing his entire body and mind to feel translucent and clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, four hundred and eighty million tiny apertures had appeared on the surface of Chen Xi’s clone, and a small portion of them had been opened up, whereas most of them revealed a sealed state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As far as body refiners were concerned, the human body was a universe, whereas every single tiny aperture represented a vast world. The more tiny apertures one opened up, the deeper one’s understanding of the universe was, and the stronger the strength one grasped was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all the tiny apertures on one’s body were opened, then it would be the what was called achieving immortality through the body!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength stored in every single tiny aperture was comparable to the True Essence possessed by a Violet Palace Realm cultivator, so when the thirty six million tiny apertures were added together, the amount of energy contained within them was simply impossible to estimate. It was truly unfathomably deep like an abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, it was only like this because his clone had just advanced into the Heavenly Immortal Realm, and once his cultivation grew deeper in the future, the amount of Immortal Shaman Energy stored within the tiny apertures and the number of tiny apertures that had been opened up would grow in number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Immortal Realm in body refinement was similarly divided into four levels, and they were respectively the Eastern Illumination, the Western Goldpeak, the Northern Pool, and the Southern River.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These four levels were also called the four extremes, and they respectively corresponded to the initial-stage, intermediate-stage, advanced-stage, and perfection-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm in body refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi’s clone’s cultivation had attained Eastern Illumination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was Eastern Illumination?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one looked carefully, the pattern revealed by the thirty six million tiny apertures that were opened up on Chen Xi’s body was like a scorching sun that hung on the eastern sky, whereas, the Immortal Shaman Energy within the tiny apertures were like sunlight that completely illuminated the vital energy within his body down to the slightest detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, it was called the Eastern Illumination level.</span></p>
