Moreover, there’s even a group of fellows looking for trouble with me after I entered a restaurant, and they’re making a ruckus about how to plan their pursuit against me…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that I really seem to be so easily bullied?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really wanted some silence and wasn’t willing to stir up trouble at this moment because he was very worried that some unexpected misfortune would come looking for him once he bashed up these bastards.</span></p>

They were truly unable to understand why a fellow that was ordinary from head to toe would dare to speak with them in such a manner.</span></p>

I dare you to say it again!” Zhao Cheng frowned, and his face was slightly gloomy.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The female attendants of Immortal Indulgence Restaurant in the surroundings had gone pale, and the gazes they looked at Chen Xi with were slightly complicated. They seemed to take pleasure in his misfortune yet seemed to pity him at the same time, but the strongest expression in their eyes was bewilderment and wonder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were indeed unable to understand, and they felt Chen Xi was an idiot.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be he doesn’t know that these young men and woman present here are the outstanding disciples of the various great powers in Cloudray City? Moreover, four of them are existences that are ranked on the Continent Ascensio Rankings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He isn’t leaving now but staying here like an idiot instead. This is simply no different than courting his own death!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What waste your breath on this fellow? Just throw him onto the streets.” Huang Tianhu who had the most explosive temper strode forward, and his entire body was suffused with a cold aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Cheng raised his head slightly and glanced at Huang Tianhu before he said, “Tianhu, this is the Immortal Indulgence Pavilion, so don’t go too far.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, I’ll surely throw this kid out in one piece.” Huang Tianhu sneered before swiftly moving over to stand before Chen Xi’s table, and his palms opened up like dustpans that surged with icy cold Immortal Force as he grabbed towards Chen Xi’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignorant little fellow. Allow this Young Master to teach you the consequences of failing to appreciate someone’s kindness today!” His palms grabbed down with a ferocious impetus. Even though he said he wouldn’t harm Chen Xi, but under the force of this strike, any other person would surely face the consequence of having his shoulders shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck off!” Chen Xi suddenly raised his hand while a pair of flames surged within his indifferent eyes, whereas his hand had suddenly stretched out like iron chain that lay across a river, and he grabbed onto Huang Tianhu’s right wrist before swinging lightly, causing Huang Tianhu’s robust figure to be directly thrown out the window.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AH!!!” Huang Tianhu’s face turned grim, and he intended to swiftly readjust his figure before charging back at Chen Xi. However, he was struck by a light flick of Chen Xi’s finger, causing a strand of force to silently assault him and enter his body, and it sealed up all the vital energy within his body, causing him to seem like a stiff wooden puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, a bang resounded as Huang Tianhu fell onto the street outside with his face flat on the ground, and he’d passed out. His entire body was suffused with a layer of ice, and it was caused by the strand of the Laws of Water that was contained within Chen Xi’s strike and had sealed up the vital energy in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the second floor of the restaurant, the expressions of Zhao Cheng and the others turned grim because Huang Tianhu had actually been tossed out and passed out from falling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this be possible?</span></p>

Moreover, his rankings on the Continental Ascensio Rankings were merely slightly lower than Zhao Cheng and Ren Yue’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this fellow that was extremely ordinary in appearance, dressing, and cultivation had actually instantly blasted Huang Tianhu flying, and this was simply like a scene from a nightmare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who exactly are you? If you still don’t reveal your name, then don’t blame us for being rude!” Zhao Cheng spoke in a low voice while his expression was extremely gloomy. He knew very well that someone who could defeat Huang Tianhu so easily was absolutely not an ordinary figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others revealed hostile expressions as well.</span></p>

So in the next moment, he’s stood up while his gaze that was like a bolt of lightning swept coldly past Zhao Cheng and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fuck off?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Attack!”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Cheng and the others exchanged glances before they shouted successively, and they called out to their companions as they attacked fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, I’m unable to escape the annoyance of these flies this time…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi laughed with self-ridicule while the ill feelings in his heart that had been accumulated throughout the day transformed completely into battle intent that surged out of his body. In an instant, Chen Xi seemed to have become a different person, and he was like a peerless weapon of slaughter that had bathed in the blood of countless people and was unsheathed at this moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Cheng and the others who were the first to bear the brunt of it felt as if they were hit by a myriad of mountains, causing their bodies to tremble abruptly while they stopped in their tracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

They spat out mouthfuls of blood while they lay scattered on the floor, and they’d smashed apart countless tables, chairs, and other furniture.</span></p>

All of them spat out a mouthful of blood while their countenances had become pale as sheets, and they were shocked to the extreme.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be helped, if Zhao Cheng and the others were to suffer any mishaps in the Immortal Indulgence Restaurant, then all of them would probably be unable to avoid being implicated as well.</span></p>

I hope that Young Master can let them off.” At this moment, a beautiful figure walked in from the entrance of the second floor. This was a gorgeous woman with snow white skin and a hot and seductive figure. Every single move she made carried a hasty, bold, and unrestrained feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as she walked into the second floor and saw the ground covered in a mess while Zhao Cheng and the others sat on the ground with blood stained clothes, her beautiful brows couldn’t help but raise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister Ran Jing!”</span></p>

This fellow is domineering, arrogant, and acts willfully, and he beat all of us up. You must uphold justice for all of us.” When Zhao Cheng saw Ran Jing make an appearance, he seemed as if he’d encountered his savior and spoke in a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. This fellow went too far and regarded the members of our Cloudray Sect as nothing. He’s truly detestable!” The others complained at the same time as well.</span></p>

You were beaten up, yet don’t resolve yourself to work harder, and you wail and whine instead. Do you know shame or not? Fuck off! All of you fuck off! Vanish from my sight right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Zhao Cheng and the others turned grim, and it was unsightly to the limit.</span></p>

You think you’ve grown wings and can fly on your own, so you don’t respect me anymore?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Cheng and the others revealed dejected expressions from being berated like this, and they didn’t dare hesitate any longer.

So he immediately said without a change in his voice or expression, “Miss, I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong person. If there’s nothing else, then please move aside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ran Jing didn’t back down in the slightest instead, and she started at Chen Xi and spoke while seeming to be lost in thought. “A cultivation at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm, yet you were able to defeat my Junior Brother and those young geniuses of Cloudray City. Moreover, your appearance is so unfamiliar. Obviously, you aren’t someone from Cloudray City. If you aren’t Chen Xi, then who could you be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned while a wisp of vigilance arose in his heart instead, and he said, “If I’m Chen Xi, I would have probably killed you a long time ago.”</span></p>
