 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just moments ago, Chen Xi had entered the world of stars and only chatted with him for a short moment before starting to sit cross-legged in meditation, and from the beginning until the end, Chen Xi remained silent, as if he was comprehending something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, as far as Ji Yu was concerned, the strength Chen Xi possessed now was comparable to some peerless and monstrous geniuses of the primordial era, and it was even slightly more formidable than infant Ancient Fiendgods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Possessing this level of strength allowed one to completely be able to be ranked at the peak amongst cultivators with the same cultivation!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if the boundless world and everything within it were locked onto by this punch.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At practically the exact same time, a terrifying energy that was filled with the intent to obliterate everything blasted out from the fist with a bang, and then it transformed into two streams of air. One was vast and surging, and it contained Water Dao Insight; the other was violent and raging, and it contained Fire Dao Insight. They were like a water and a fire dragon that collided with each other as they whistled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

When looked at from afar, it was as if a void passageway had been opened up in space, and it emitted an aura that caused one’s heart to palpitate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first move of the Grand Obliteration First, Earthly Obliteration, but it was executed by Chen Xi by utilizing the Fire and Water Dao Insights, so it was just renamed by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A really good fist technique! But the strength exerted by this strike seems to not be the true might of this fist technique…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Yu’s eyes constricted, and then he suddenly came to an understanding. With his discerning ability, he was naturally able to discern that Chen Xi had only drawn support from the technique of utilizing Dao Insights from this fist technique and had not utilized the Dao Insight possessed by this fist technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even then, the might of this strike was still exceedingly formidable. The two Dao Insights of Fire and Water were two types of energies that occupied two extremes, and they rejected each other. So this strike’s ability of releasing the Dao Insights of Fire and Water using a special method, causing the concept of it to be so ingenious that it could be said to be incomparably amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a great figure that possessed great wisdom would be able to create a martial technique like this.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One black and the other white, two types of energies shrouded his fist as if two worlds were being developed. One world had the heavens below and the earth atop, and it seemed as if it was an overturned world. The other world was extremely normal, yet all the beings in the world were overturned, their heads were on the ground while their feet in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With just a single glance from afar, it caused others to have an awful feeling to the point of wanting to spit blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fist that contained two types of completely overturned and entirely repulsive energies finally exploded out with a bang. Instantly, the world was overturned, Yin and Yang was in chaos, and the boundless space was blasted to the point of being utterly shattered and falling into great chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this strike hadn’t been completely struck out and the energy within it hadn’t been completely released when Chen Xi’s body staggered instantly as his face went pale, and he almost fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This won’t do. I’m still slightly lacking. The Dao Insights of Yin and Yang are too strong, and if I’m unable to completely grasp the essence of this strike, then not only would I be unable to bring forth its might, it would probably injure me… But where exactly have I gone wrong?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath as he frowned and contemplated deeply. He carefully recalled every single detail when he struck out earlier, and he fell completely into a dazed state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The energy of Yin and Yang are the two strongest Dao Insights amongst the quintessence energies. If you’re able to fuse them in a single fist, it might be greatly beneficial to your comprehension of the Grand Daos of Yin and Yang in the future.” Ji Yu nodded slightly when he saw this, and then he turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was going to help Ling Bai repair his body. Since fusing the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit into Ling Bai’s body, the little fellow’s consciousness had fallen into a comatose state, and he was unable to awaken for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On one hand, it was because Ling Bai was a strand of sword soul and wasn’t contained within the five elements. So if he wanted to change into a different body, it was much more difficult than any other living being in the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, because Ling Bai had sacrificed his own vitality on two occasions, it had caused great consumption to his body. After he fused with the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit, he’d only changed into a different body, yet if he wanted to recover the essence of his vitality, it wasn’t something that could be recovered in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Ji Yu was extremely sure that on the day Ling Bai awoke, Ling Bai’s strength would surely reveal an explosive increase at a terrifying speed, and combined with the Goldsoul Body, Ling Bai’s strength would probably be slightly more formidable than Chen Xi at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Yu extremely anticipated the arrival of that day.</span></p>

Subsequently, a dragon roar that shook the heavens and the earth resounded out as a myriad of rays of lights shot out.</span></p>

They felt as if a divine dragon had awoken from its slumber in the ground beneath their feet, and it opened its eyes that were covered in dust for countless years and roared proudly in all directions, causing the winds and the clouds to shake.</span></p>

Supposedly, it already existed before Silken City was constructed, and it was exceedingly ancient.</span></p>

Besides resisting the Dao Insight energies of the mountain itself, you have to watch out for others. In the previous Allstar Meetings, there were some geniuses with good cultivations that were forced off the mountain and left with hatred in their hearts. You must be careful to guard against this.”</span></p>

Without the jade token, don’t even dream about entering the Ascension Peak.”</span></p>

If it wasn’t for Ji Yu reminding him, he’d almost missed an important event.</span></p>
