 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now Bing Shitian was about to arrive at Primeval City and would surely meet Qing Xiuyi.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Exactly what sort of havoc would arise when they reunite once again?</span></p>

As a normal man, he naturally didn’t hope that would have any connection with another man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kid, wipe that bitter expression of your face. If you don’t want your woman to be seized by another, then wouldn’t it be settled if you work hard and defeat all your rivals?” Madman Liu chucked as he said, “I can take the responsibility to tell you that Qing Xiuyi was extremely proud in her previous life, and there wasn’t a single man that could enter her eyes, including Bing Shitian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chen Xi’s spirits were refreshed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi actually looked down upon Bing Shitian? She was really proud enough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, even I’m unable to wrap my head around why such a proud person like Qing Xiuyi would take a fancy to a stupid kid like you, and you actually got her without making a single sound. It’s simply like romance that descended from the heavens. If it were to be spread to the Dark Reverie, it would absolutely cause an uproar.” Madman Liu praised endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi rubbed his nose as he recalled the bumpy relationship he had with Qing Xiuyi, and he felt that it was indeed a slight accident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could even be said that he had to thank Shang Kun. Without Shang Kun doing such a hateful thing, how could he have possibly caused such a great commotion and made Qing Xiuyi change her attitude towards him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In short, all of this seemed as if it had been predestined by a higher power long ago. There was resentment, hostility, and collision, and it was complicated and breathtaking. Yet when he thought about it now, all of it had transformed into a beautiful memory instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But you have to be careful. This love rival of yours isn’t so easy to deal with. You’re utterly not a match for him now, and you have to take precautions against him feeling hatred towards you because of his love for her and intending to harm you.” Madman Liu’s expression became solemn as he warned seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, facing this Heavenly Immortal, Bing Shitian, had similarly brought great pressure to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded, and then he frowned. “But as a Heavenly Immortal and with his status, he ought to not do something that’s beneath his dignity, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s hard to say. Was anyone capable of seeing through love since ancient times?” Madman Liu shook his head and sighed. “In conclusion, it’s best that you be careful. At that time, if a conflict really does occur, I’ll naturally not sit idly by and remain indifferent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had Chen Xi imagined that Madman Liu would actually speak such resolute words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Bing Shitian was a Heavenly Immortal that had already stood proudly at the highest peak in the Mortal Dimension and was a supreme existence. If it was any other Earthly Immortal Realm expert, then not to mention going against a Heavenly Immortal, they would probably not even dare have the thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Madman Liu had spoken like this instead. His words seemed to be spoken casually, yet his intention to protect Chen Xi within these words were so firm and resolute, causing Chen Xi to be unable to help but be moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath as he said seriously, “Thank you, Senior!”</span></p>

Even though he’d come to Primeval City this time because Bai Wanqing asked him to, yet with his status, he actually had utterly no need to do this, and he was completely able to think of various ways to refuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that there was utterly no need for him to speak with a junior like Chen Xi.</span></p>

Don’t call me senior!” Madman Liu rolled his eyes before returning to his obstinate and disagreeable appearance.</span></p>

It was a courtyard that occupied a vast area, a single house which had its own courtyard and entrance, with a small bridge over a flowing stream, artificial mountains, and fountains, and there was even a luxuriant garden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this courtyard had been left completely unattended for countless years, causing it to be overgrown with weeds and moss, and it was suffused with an ancient aura and seemed desolate and quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Courtyards like this could be see all over Primeval City, and it wasn’t rare.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the approach of the final test of the Primeval Battlefield, there were more and more Dynasties that had arrived safely in Primeval City, causing the number of people to rise explosively, so it naturally became difficult to find a residence in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that numerous bloody incidents had erupted for the sake of seizing a residence.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, with the presence of the two great Earthly Immortal Realm experts, Yun Lansheng and Madman Liu, there wasn’t any ignorant fool that dared cause trouble in the northeast area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sat cross-legged within his room. His mind that had been strained since entering the Primeval Battlefield was finally able to relax, and he felt a feeling of relief that he hadn’t felt in a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he didn’t dare slack off. A month of time passed by in the blink of an eye to cultivators, and it was even to the extent it could pass during a single period of meditating and cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi naturally wouldn’t seek to break through in his cultivation at a time like this, and he started sorting and counting his gains before refining the Talisman Armament once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

All of their qualities were exceedingly extraordinary, and they were covered in strands of strings of Dao markings, causing them to be ‘Dao grade’ treasures. If they were placed in the outside world, they were sufficiently rare to be called treasures that could only be chanced upon by luck and not sought after.</span></p>

If all of its petals were able to develop Dao markings, then he would be entirely capable of using it as a main material to refine a Dao Insight Origin Pill that contained the Grand Dao of Lightning!</span></p>

These treasures that were similar to the golden cores of cultivators were obtained by him from hunting the sea demons in the Primitive Sea, and he possessed an entire few tens of thousands of them. Not only did these Origin pearls contain the essence of a sea demon’s cultivation, they also contained strands of Dao Insights, causing their value to be shocking to the extreme.</span></p>

He’d already created a herb garden there, and it was filled with dense Second-Wood Qi, causing it to be extremely suitable for the growth of spirit herbs.</span></p>

Otherwise, once another battle erupted, then with his cultivation, he wouldn’t be able to persist for a long time before his True Essence was consumed and dried up, so he wanted to utilize these Origin Pearls to refine a batch of medicinal pills.</span></p>

The Primeval Battlefield wasn’t like any other place and didn’t have any shops that sold medicinal pills. Unless one had mastered an extremely skilled pill refinement technique, otherwise, one could only make do like this.</span></p>

It was from within the Crimsonfire Divine Talisman and wasn’t a real furnace, yet its effect was much better than a real furnace, and when used to smelt various materials, it was capable of producing an unimaginable and miraculous effect.</span></p>

If one looked carefully, then one would notice that the stream was shockingly made of numerous Origin Pearls that were crystalline, translucent, and glowing, and they seemed to be emitting a rhythm that was like the beat of a heart as if they were alive.</span></p>

A rough count actually put all of them at over 40 thousand, and they were sufficient to last until the final test ended.</span></p>
