 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, an intense battle was playing out here, and the terrifying attacks shook the mountains into pieces and crushed the plants, causing the spirit energy of the heaven and earth in an area of 50km to become extremely chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Every single time it smashed down, it would carry a monstrous and ferocious might that crushed mountains into pieces and swept through everything that stood before it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his opponent was obviously more skillful than him. The Corrosion Dao Insight that contained toxic poison transformed into countless roiling mist dragons that caused the hard rocks and luxuriant plants everywhere it passed to be completely transformed into dust before being completely corroded to nothingness, and the ground even cracked open into numerous horrifying rifts by the corrosive energy that contained toxic poison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was corrosive and toxic to the point that even the air was tainted black by it, and it emitted a stench that caused one to vomit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just give up. You aren’t a match for me. I can spare your life so long as you hand over the spiked club in your hand and pledge allegiance to me. How about it?” Sikong Hen’s body was like a wisp of black smoke that fluttered about indeterminately in the sky, and his pure white and flawless palm danced about repeatedly as he slapped out numerous black colored mist dragons that covered the heavens and the earth while raging out in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He admired Mu Kui’s ferociousness and ruthlessness, and he intended to take Mu Kui for himself. So he didn’t attack ruthlessly, otherwise his current cultivation was enough to kill Mu Kui within a hundred moves, and he utterly wouldn’t have been trying to turn Mu Kui over to his side until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t kid yourself! You’re about to die, yet still boast shamelessly? Truly ridiculous and laughable!” Mu Kui laughed loudly and endlessly, yet his heart was extremely heavy and didn’t dare be the slightest bit careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Sikong Hen’s attacks that didn’t leave a single gap in the sky, his silver colored skin and fur were tainted with some black colored mist that were filled with a corrosive energy, and they were like cancer that was utterly impossible to get rid of. If this situation was to be allowed to continue, then Sikong Hen didn’t have to make a move, yet the skin and flesh on his entire body would be completely corroded, causing him to completely lose his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death! Looks like you’re just like your Master and refuse to repent until you’re facing your coffin. Since it’s like this, I’ll kill you and will similarly be able to obtain that spiked club.” Sikong Hen laughed coldly as he revealed killing intent, and then he moved with profound steps as his entire body abruptly emitted boundless black mist that condensed in his white and slender palm to form an enormous jagged wheel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wheel was large like the size of a house and completely pitch black, and its borders were covered in numerous sharp teeth. Boundless corrosive energy whistled and surged within the wheel to form a terrifying vortex that emitted a frightening swallowing, corrosive, and toxic aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish! Swish!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a formidable Dao Grade martial technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui was astounded in his heart and didn’t hesitate in the slightest to flap his wings and flee towards the distance. He didn’t have the confidence to receive this attack, so he could only preserve his life for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Want to escape? You can be proud of yourself for being able to die under my Wheel of Corrosion!” Sikong Hen shouted out explosively as his arms shook. The enormous wheel rose into the air with a bang, and it was like a slowly rising black colored sun that shot out jet black lights and covered the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack! Crack!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jet black light emitted by the wheel swept out into an area of 50km, causing the mountains, forest, streams, and demon beasts that weren’t able to flee in time to be completely tainted in a layer of a strange black color before their bodies were corroded to the point of being gaping with holes, and they emitted an extremely rotten stench.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui’s figure was covered by the jet black light as well, yet the surface of his body possessed a layer of a dense barrier supporting him. But the strength of the jet black light was truly too terrifying, causing the barrier to swiftly be corroded at a speed that was visible to the eye, and no matter how Mu Kui exerted all his strength, it was unable to withstand the corrosive energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that I, Mu Kui, am going to die here today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This won’t do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if I die, I have to pull this bastard along with me so that I can finish off this final trouble of my Master’s! &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t flee anymore and charged towards Sikong Hen instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmm?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sikong Hen was stunned, and then he saw a dazzling golden core abruptly fly out from Mu Kui’s mouth, causing him to instantly understand everything.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This animal actually intends to detonate his golden core and bring me down with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dammit! What ability does that kid, Chen Xi, possess to actually take such a loyal wolf demon as his servant…? But, want to bring me down with you? Impossible!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sikong Hen’s expression darkened. He stood on the spot as he raised his hands up to actually hold the black colored wheel up high, and then he strode forward before fiercely smashing it towards Mu Kui!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before the black colored wheel could leave his hands, a wisp of fierce and swift sword light shot out explosively with a matchless speed, and it pierced directly towards Sikong Hen’s heart from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit!” Sikong Hen sensed the bone piercing sword light that came from behind, causing him to be greatly shocked in his heart, and he abandoned attacking Mu Kui right away before swinging up the black colored wheel to block before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword light collided with the black colored wheel, causing an explosive force that was like the eruption of a volcano to blast out towards the surroundings. The terrifying airflow caused by the explosion shook the earth and dimmed out the sky, and even the heavens and the earth fell into an expanse of violent and chaotic flow of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s Master!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui was stunned, and then he put away his golden core right away before looking towards the distant Chen Xi who was already locked in battle with Sikong Hen as a wisp of happiness from surviving with his life gushed out from his eyes. He knew that if it wasn’t for his Master arriving in time, he would probably have detonated his golden core and died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha! Sikong Hen, I told you that you’re dead today, yet you didn’t believe me! Take this!” Mu Kui let out a loud and unrestrained laugh as his figure flashed out into the sky, and then he raised the spiked club and smashed it down at Sikong Hen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sikong Hen’s strength was extremely formidable, and when combined with his exceedingly insidious Corrosion Dao Insight, his strength was almost comparable to Huangfu Chongming. But it was obviously somewhat inferior when compared with Chen Xi. At this moment, Mu Kui’s addition into the battle instantly caused Sikong Hen’s situation to become critical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why is it like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m actually not a match for an ant at the Golden Hall Realm with my current strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shock in Sikong Hen’s heart grew the longer he fought. He noticed that both his speed and martial techniques were suppressed by Chen Xi, and only his strength slightly occupied an advantageous position. However, this was utterly incapable of turning the situation around, whereas, after Mu Kui joined the battle, he didn’t have the slightest advantage any longer.</span></p>
