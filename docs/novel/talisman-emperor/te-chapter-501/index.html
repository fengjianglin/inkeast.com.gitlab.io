 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them knew clearly that it wasn’t just Chen Xi and his companions, even the name of the Darchu Dynasty was spread throughout the entire Primeval City and shake the hearts of every single person in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was in the boundless years of the past, basically the entire top 30 of the Warsoul Tablet was occupied by the formidable experts of the top Dynasties and Prestigious Clans, and it was like an iron law that no one could shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But today, everyone from Chen Xi’s group had charged into the top 20, and Chen Xi had even ascended the first ranking to reign supreme above all. It was equivalent to completely breaking the unshakable iron law that no one from the ordinary Dynasties was capable of entering the top 30, and it shook the hearts of all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, I’m leaving for a while. Why don’t all of you stay with Brother Ling first, and I’ll come back to look for all of you in a while?” Chen Xi paid no attention to the unusual gazes shot at him from the surroundings, and he directly spoke out to Huangfu Qingying and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying was stunned and asked. “What’re you leaving to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a long story, I’ll tell all of you once I get back.” Chen Xi pondered briefly before he spoke out. Actually, he intended to go take a look at Yu Xuanchen as the brief moment he saw Yu Xuanchen caused him to have a slight feeling that something was wrong in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Chen Xi turned and left decisively and without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow is always so mysterious.” Young Master Zhou couldn’t help but mutter as he watched Chen Xi’s figure vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friends from the Darchu Dynasty, I’m Xue Ranchen. If you don’t mind, we don’t we get to know each other?” While Chen Xi left, Xue Ranchen who’d always been paying attention to the happenings here was finally unable to refrain from walking over, and he cupped his hands towards Huangfu Qingying as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying looked at this young man that had originally obtained the 5</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><sup>th</sup> ranking yet was pushed down by Chen Xi and Su Qingyan to the 7</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><sup>th</sup> ranking, and she knew that he was from the Huaiyin Kingdom’s Xue Clan and possessed a significant status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she didn’t feel ill at ease and smiled in a natural and graceful manner. “I’m Huangfu Qingying, this is Zhao Qinghe, Young Master Zhou, Ling Yu, and this is Senior Brother Ling Ze from the Dartang Dynasty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know very well. The five positions in the top 30 of the Warsoul Tablet have been occupied by all of you, and all of you are even from the same Dynasty. Such a thing is truly enviable. I believe that all of you will surely be able to make a great display of talent in the final test of in the Primeval Battlefield that’s happening soon.” Xue Ranchen spoke sincerely, and his gaze inadvertently glanced at Ling Ze as he spoke before being withdrawn by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This leading figure from the Xue Clan always had an icy cold and arrogant bearing, yet for the sake of engaging with Huangfu Qingying and the others, his attitude was actually extraordinarily friendly, causing Huangfu Qingying and the others to be surprised in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, all of them understood as well that the change in Xue Ranchen’s attitude was surely related to the measurement of their strengths from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Daoist Brother Xue is too kind, all of this was only luck.” Chen Xi wasn’t present so Huangfu Qingying took the role of ‘leader,’ and she smiled as she spoke in an elegant, dignified, and flawless manner that fully revealed the social ability that a princess of an imperial family ought to possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Ranchen shook his head and smiled. He originally thought that since Chen Xi had left, he would be entirely capable of relying on his identity to make these disciples of an ordinary Dynasty reveal slight reverence towards him. After that, he could make use of the opportunity to invite them to join his forces, and he wouldn’t have to worry that they wouldn’t agree. Moreover, they might even be grateful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But based on the current circumstances, his wishful thinking had obviously been misplaced. This graceful and beautiful young woman wasn’t an ordinary figure that was so easily fooled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, I presume you’ve just arrived at Primeval City and don’t have a place to stay yet, right? I have some empty residences over at my place. If all of you don’t mind, you can stay at my place for a while. I’ll surely welcome all of you with open arms and host a feast for your arrival.” Xue Ranchen stopped trying to cover it up and directly put forward his invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and the others were stunned, and they seemed to have never imagined that Xue Ranchen would actually invite them so warmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Xue’s place is neighboring to the Shang Clan, so it’s probably not good, right?” Before Huangfu Qingying and the others could reply, the beautiful and lively Su Qingyan on the other side had already walked over while smiling lightly. At this moment, she walked over barefooted in her white clothes with a grin on her face, coupled with her black hair that was like a waterfall, her attitude seemed extraordinarily warm like a celestial maiden, and it caused others to be unable to feel aversion towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In my opinion, why don’t Big Sister Huangfu and all of you stay temporarily at my Darkhan Dynasty’s territory? According to my knowledge, the Shang Clan has captured two of your companions from the Darchu Dynasty, and it’s still planning to form an alliance with the Feng Clan and Xue Clan. It will probably be slightly unsafe if all of you stay at Daoist Brother Xue’s territory.” Su Qingyan smiled sweetly, and she casually revealed too many obscure secrets, causing the expressions of Huangfu Qingying and the others to instantly go grim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They naturally knew who the two companions Su Qingyan spoke of were, but they never expected that it was just as Chen Xi had guessed, Zhen Liuqing and Qing Xiuyi had really been captured by the Shang Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huangfu Qingying was terribly upset, and she wished for nothing more than to chase after Chen Xi who’d just left and tell this to him so that she could hear his opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Who said that my Xue Clan is forming an alliance with the Shang Clan? That’s the Shang Clan’s own wishful thinking! My Xue Clan didn’t agree to it!” Xue Ranchen’s expression instantly darkened extremely when he saw Su Qingyan had come out to disturb the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Su Qingyan’s eyes lit up when she heard Xue Ranchen’s reply, and she ran her hands through the black hair above her ears as she smiled. “That’s good. Truthfully speaking, if the three great Prestigious Clans were to join together, then there probably would be no power in the entire Primeval City capable of going against all of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Su, don’t presume that I don’t know your Darkhan Dynasty is communicating with the Darjou and Dartang Dynasties with the intention of forming an alliance to go against us!” Xue Ranchen didn’t hold back in the slightest and answered with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and the others instantly came to an understanding. The reason they had suddenly become such welcomed figures to the point that even existences like Xue Ranchen and Su Qingyan took the initiative to speak to them was none other than the rankings they’d obtained on the Warsoul Tablet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ranking was presumably something that even the three top Dynasties and three Prestigious Clans wouldn’t dare overlook. After all, if they were able to rope Huangfu Qingying and the others in, they would undoubtedly be able to greatly increase their strengths, and Xue Ranchen and Su Qingyan probably held the thought of roping them in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry, when Chen Xi just left, he’d already said clearly that Young Princess Huangfu and the others would listen to my arrangement. So there’s naturally no need for the both of you to worry about their residences.” Right at this moment, the nearby Ling Ze suddenly walked forward and smiled as he spoke directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Ranchen and Su Qingyan that were in a verbal battle were stunned when they heard this, and they stopped their dispute with great tacit understanding before shooting their gazes towards Ling Ze. After that, both of them frowned. “The Dartang Dynasty’s Ling Ze?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Precisely.” Ling Ze smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the other cultivators in the surroundings of the Warsoul Tablet noticed this scene as well, and for a time, all of them sighed with emotion and envy in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They’re only disciples from an ordinary Dynasty, yet drew the warm invitation of two top Dynasties and a Prestigious Clan from an Ancient Kingdom. Such an honor is something that few are able to enjoy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw the Dartang Dynasty had actually made a move earlier than them, Su Qingyan and Xue Ranchen both frowned, yet were unwilling to give up. Both of them looked once more at Huangfu Qingying and the others, and they seemed to want to hear what they said.</span></p>

I’ll remember the great hospitality of both of you, and I’ll come visit both of you another day.”</span></p>

Big Sister Huangfu, remember to come play with me when you’re free.” Su Qingyan blinked her eyes and stopped at just the right moment. She didn’t put on a display that was too warm, and she turned and left elegantly as soon as she finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying couldn’t help but laugh in her heart as she looked at Su Qingyan’s leaving figure that was graceful and moving.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only is this woman beautiful, she’s extremely intelligent.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to her knowledge, the eight areas of Primeval City had already been divided up by the various powers. For example, the Shang Clan controlled the northwest area of Primeval City. If cultivators from an ordinary Dynasty wanted to have a foothold in the city, then they had to depend on these powers.</span></p>

However, Chen Xi has just left a moment ago, and she didn’t know when he would return, so she could only temporarily make decisions for everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course.” Ling Ze replied without the slightest hesitation. “Those companions of mine from the Dartang Dynasty will surely be extremely welcoming towards all of you, so there’s no need for all of you to worry about anything else. Just leave everything to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, Ling Ze spoke with a slightly teasing tone. “Even if I wanted to trick all of you, I have to ask if my younger brother agrees.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s true.” The nearby Ling Yu rubbed his head as he grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Since it’s like this, then we’ll trouble Daoist Brother Ling Ze.” Huangfu Qingying spoke seriously. She knew that since Ling Ze dared answer so firmly, he’d surely made sufficient preparations. Even if they really entered into a battle with the Shang Clan for the sake of saving Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing in the future, the forces of the Dartang Dynasty would surely not stand idly by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, they would have no choice but to pay a price as well, and the price would be that they had to become allies with the Dartang Dynasty for any future actions.</span></p>

If Young Princess Huangfu still acts so courteously, then you’ll really be treating me like an outsider.” Ling Ze roared with laughter. Being able to invite Huangfu Qingying and the others to join his side caused him to feel extremely happy as well.</span></p>

After all, the rankings of this group of people on the Warsoul Tablet were all in the top 20, and one of them was even the first!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
