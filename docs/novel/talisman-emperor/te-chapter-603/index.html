The feathered fan is suffused with fragrance and is a valued piece of poetry, and it’s only 80 gold pieces. Don’t miss this opportunity.” This was the cry of a feathered fan peddler.</span></p>

You’re going to head to the capital for the exams as well? I heard the Imperial Academy’s Head Examiner is Lord Xiao Jinyu. He’s an upright and impartial person that possesses a powerful style of writing, and he detests flowery writing that’s flashy but without substance the most. We have to consider Lord Xiao Jinyu’s preference properly when we write, otherwise we’ll probably fail the exam.”</span></p>

Even though they were tiny and ordinary like ants yet they lived and died endlessly, forming the myriad of forms of the mortal world and drove the changes in history.</span></p>

Commoners rise and fall on the path of life, carrying out manual labor for the sake of their own livelihoods. How laughable is it that cultivators look down upon commoners and feel they’re supreme, and they think all living beings are ants? But under the Heaven Dao, who is the one that’s truly tiny and like an ant?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If I’m able to stand above the Heaven Dao in this lifetime, then would I be able to transcend above everything?</span></p>

For the first time, he had the intention and strong impulse to break open the shackles upon him and stand above the Heaven Dao.</span></p>

The young girl was short and emaciated, dark skin, and a dirty face, and only her pair of clear and pitch black large eyes were bright like the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young girl noticed Chen Xi had stood before their straw sandal stall for a long time, and she thought he’d taken a fancy to one of the straw sandals her mother had weaved, so she hesitated for a moment before mustering the courage to ask with a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Girl, keep your mouth shut!” The middle aged woman’s face went grim as she reprimanded the young girl. A normal person couldn’t compare to the bearing Chen Xi revealed, and she was worried that her daughter speaking like this would cause Chen Xi to be displeased as that would be troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, but what will we do about little brother’s sickness if we can’t gather enough money?” The young girl lowered her head while her little hands intertwined together with uneasiness, and she spoke weakly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi returned to his senses, and he noticed that clothes of this mother and daughter were covered in patches and extremely shabby. Obviously, they lived their lives in extreme poverty and were very pitiable.</span></p>

Chen Xi was able to discern with a single glance that they hadn’t sold a single pair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, it was already dusk, and if nothing unexpected happened, they might not have any income today.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah! Thank you, Young Master. Thank you, Young Master…” The middle aged woman couldn’t help but be stunned when she saw the large and heavy silver coin on her hand, and then she hurriedly expressed her gratitude and was excited to the point she spoke slightly incoherently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had already left trippingly instead.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when she looked once more, she was unable to find Chen Xi’s figure any longer, and there was only that silver coin in her mother’s hand. This caused the young girl to think that she’d encountered a god of legend, and her pitch black and large eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

It couldn’t be considered to be precious, yet it was a requisite material to refine a heaven-rank spirit pill.</span></p>

Moreover, it’s deep in the night while raining cats and dogs with thunderclaps tearing through the sky. Why would there be someone coming here at this time…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eh, so it’s them.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s Divine Sense stretched out and instantly saw a pair of mother and daughter at the bottom of the wasteland braving the rainstorm as they walked over. They staggered along while completely drenched, and they seemed to be in an extremely sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were precisely the pair of impoverished mother and daughter Chen Xi had seen peddling straw sandals in Hidden Moat City.</span></p>

After all, the evil spirits here were indifferent to good and bad when they killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, there’s light over there. Let’s go in and avoid the rain first. How about we return home overnight after the rain stops?”</span></p>

You walk slower and be careful.” Not long after, the pair of mother and daughter had arrived on the wasteland and hurried into the ruined temple, and they were both stunned when they pushed open the door and saw Chen Xi who was by the fire. They seemed to have never imagined that they would actually encounter Chen Xi here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sit down and warm yourselves first.” Chen Xi stood up and spoke as he looked at the pair of mother and daughter who were soaked through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Young Master. Thank you, Young Master.” The middle aged woman helped the young girl wipe of the rainwater on her body as she thanked Chen Xi, and she kept repeating the same words. Even though she was slightly long-winded, Chen Xi was able to perceive that she was a simple and kind hearted woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, Chen Xi found out that this pair of mother and daughter stayed in a village on the other side of this wasteland. There was another path that led directly to the village yet since they wanted to make the best use of their time to go treat her son, she couldn’t care about anything else and could only use this nearer path to rush home overnight.</span></p>

This is the Ghost Wasteland, and there’re many evil spirits here. Aren’t you afraid?” The young girl raised her small head and asked Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since there are evil spirits, then why aren’t you afraid?” Chen Xi asked with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid. But I and my mother still have to go home and boil medicine for little brother. He’s extremely sick, and we’re very worried about him, so we can only rush home overnight.” The young girl grinned as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi looked at the brilliant smile the young girl squeezed out on her dark little face and he was stunned abruptly as a wisp of indescribable feeling of being touched and shocked arose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is only a child around the age of five or six, yet has even forgotten fear for the sake of treating her younger brother, and she even disregarded her own safety…</span></p>

See if you like it.” The young girl suddenly spoke excitedly as she carefully opened up the pocket on her clothes, and then she searched for a long time yet only took out a bunch of wet straw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The red-crowned crane has been squashed… Big Brother, I’m sorry.” A layer of tears gushed out from the large eyes of the young girl as she looked at the straw in her palm, and she spoke with a light voice.</span></p>
