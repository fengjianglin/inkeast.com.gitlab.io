 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an instant that Gao Dianyu thought he’d died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swift!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s sword was too swift. A piece of the hair before his forehead had been slashed off by the sword qi on Chen Xi’s sword, yet he’d utterly not noticed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was a true life and death battle, then wouldn’t I have died long ago?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dianyu stared right at Chen Xi who stood solitarily before him, and his countenance turned extremely pale. Only after he fought Chen Xi did he know how great the disparity was between them, and the defense he took pride in was simply like child’s play before Chen Xi’s absolute speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a deep breath and cupped his fist. “Brother Chen’s skill is outstanding, and I’m convinced of my loss. But there’s still a tiny question in my heart. May I know what percent of your strength Brother Chen used earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi thought for a moment and was slightly at a loss for how to answer him. Because he felt that Gao Dianyu would probably not believe him if he did, and perhaps Gao Dianyu would think that he was ridiculing him after obtaining victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, you don’t have to trouble yourself. I’ve already completely understood.” Gao Dianyu laughed bitterly. He wasn’t an idiot, so how could he be unable to discern Chen Xi’s difficulty? After he finished speaking, he leaped off the combat ring and vanished into the crowd in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on? Why did Gao Dianyu admit defeat?” The spectators in the surroundings of the combat ring that had witnessed this battle were baffled, and they didn’t understand exactly what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only some people with discerning gazes faintly discerned that when Gao Dianyu attacked earlier, Chen Xi had already severed the hair before Gao Dianyu’s forehead, causing the outcome to be already decided. If Gao Dianyu still didn’t admit defeat, then he would be too ignorant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the previous Han Kun to the current Gao Dianyu, both of them lost in a single move. Moreover, they lost to Chen Xi’s peerless speed, and this scene quickly drew the attention of the numerous experts in the spectating area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The number 1 combat ring is taken by Zenith Sect’s Ji Yue; the number 2 combat ring is taken by Jadepool Celestial Isle’s Hua Mobei. Now, the number 3 combat ring is taken by Chen Xi. I wonder how many successive victories he’ll be able to obtain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m unable to discern that for now. But his movement technique is formidable indeed, and it contains two types of Grand Daos. The Wind Dao Insight’s speed is peerless and all-pervasive. The Sky Dao Insight is illusory and difficult to figure out. Yet both of them have been flawlessly combined together. If one doesn’t have some formidable ability, then it’s indeed difficult to counter his movement technique.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is merely his movement technique. His sword technique hasn’t been completely revealed up until now, and he didn’t reveal any inkling. I wonder who will be able to force out his sword technique?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the discussions of everyone, Chen Xi obtained victories one after the other, and all of them lost in a single move. This scene drew the interest of more and more people, and everyone was guessing exactly who would be able to overcome the situation of Chen Xi defeating his opponents in a single move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, Chen Xi had already won 9 victories successively, and he would be able to obtain the reward for 10 successive victories, 100,000 Nascent Condensation Pills, if he won another battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, even the Rebirth Realm cultivator that presided over the battles in the number 3 combat ring, Cui Shan, had withdrawn the underestimation towards Chen Xi in his heart. After witnessing Chen Xi’s nine successive battles, besides having a shocked expression, there was actually slight seriousness on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these nine battles, every single cultivator that ascended the ring to challenge Chen Xi was stronger than the previous, and they were extremely formidable and possessed a variety of abilities. But all of them lost at his hands within a single move, and it was simply like a curse that no one could lift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This phenomenon was extremely thought provoking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of strength was capable of making Chen Xi formidable to such an extent? In terms of cultivation, he was merely at the initial-stage of the Golden Core Realm, and he was inferior by more than a single stage when compared with the others. In terms of skill, his movement technique was swift like a bolt of lightning, and it was indeed impossible to guard against. But it wasn’t impossible to counter, yet it just happened that he was able to defeat his opponent with a single move. Why was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Rebirth Realm cultivator with abundant combat experience, Cui Shan understood extremely well, that it wasn’t only cultivation that decided the outcome of a battle, and there was also the level of one’s cultivation in the Martial Dao, the strength of one’s Magic Treasure, the quality of one’s battle technique, the quality of one’s battle tactics, one’s intrinsic ability to do battle, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But though the methods may vary, the principle was the same. All of this could be summarized by the word strength, and the determination of a cultivator’s strength could be judged from these aspects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But up until now and after experiencing nine battles, Cui Shan was still unable to discern Chen Xi’s true strength, and this indicated a problem. From the beginning until the end, Chen Xi had utterly not utilized his true strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cui Shan couldn’t help but gasp in his heart when he realized this. He had an intense feeling that the speed Chen Xi revealed now was probably not his true level of speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When did a young man that keeps such a low profile appear in the southern territory? Perhaps in the Goldlake Meeting this time, he’ll become the first expert of the younger generation in the cultivation world of the southern territory to obtain 100 successive victories after so many years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the carrying on, the atmosphere in the entire scene had become more and more explosive, and cheers that rumbles like thunder resounded out frequently, causing the atmosphere to be tainted to the point it was like a raging fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area outside the venue of the Goldlake Meeting was similarly extremely bustling. The various merchants of the city had started betting areas side by side of each other, and they tightly surrounded the surroundings of the venue. They were like numerous miniature gambling dens that drew countless gamblers to linger here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“50,000! I bet that Ji Yue will obtain 50 successive victories!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh my lord, Hua Mobei, you must obtain 40 successive victories! Otherwise, all my belonging will be gone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? I can only bet that Young Master Zhou obtains 100 successive victories? Motherfucker! I’ll fucking take that bet!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sounds of betting could be heard without end from all the betting areas, and along with the situation of the competition becoming more and more intense, the eyes of all these gamblers had gone red and some had even resolutely taken out all their belongings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui hurried over excitedly as well. The 80,000 Nascent Condensation Pills he bet on his Master, Chen Xi, had a ratio of 1 to 2. So long as Chen Xi obtained 10 successive victories, then besides his capital, he would be able to obtain 160,000 Nascent Condensation Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Chen Xi had already obtained nine consecutive victories, so Mu Kui had come to take his earnings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, why are the two of you here as well?” When Mu Kui arrived before a betting area, he shockingly saw Zhong Liao and Wei Feng at the side, and he couldn’t help but be slightly surprised. According to his knowledge, in the nearby betting areas, compared to Young Master Zhou, An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, Su Clan, and the other hot candidates, there were extremely few bets opened that were related to his Master, Chen Xi, and the betting area before him was one that he’d found with great difficulty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We… We bet that Senior Chen Xi would win as well.” Wei Feng and Zhong Liao’s expressions were slightly awkward when they saw Mu Kui appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, how much did the both of you bet?” Mu Kui asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I bet 30,000; Zhong Liao bet 50,000,” said Feng Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui gave them a thumbs up and praised. “Both of you have good judgment, just wait to collect money.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, looks like the three of you are extremely confident of Chen Xi. Then I wish your wishes come true and earn a great deal.” The banker of the betting area put on a fake smile, and his expression was rather disapproving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a page charged over hastily and disregarded the sweat the streamed down his face as he passed over a jade slip, and it recorded the situation in the 18 combat rings during this period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The banker took it in his hand and read it, and he was stunned instantly. “He really obtained 10 successive victories?” After that, he laughed slyly and cupped his hands. “Congratulations, will all of you continue betting, or…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui waved his hand and said, “I’ll continue, they will as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Feng said hesitantly, “Can we…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You don’t look favorably upon my Master?” Mu Kui glared and fiercely swept Wei Feng and Zhong Liao with his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We dare not, we dare not.” Wei Feng and Zhong Liao hurriedly spoke while waving their hand, and they lamented in their hearts instead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did we encounter such an unreasonable person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Truthfully speaking, they did indeed look favorably upon Chen Xi, yet it was only limited to obtaining 10 successive victories, because experts were numerous like the clouds in the Goldlake Meeting. Chen Xi’s display couldn’t be considered to be outstanding, causing them to be extremely worried about whether Chen Xi would be able to obtain 20 successive victories, so they were thinking of watching for a while before betting, yet never had they imagined that a situation like this would appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nevermind, nevermind, we’ll just take it as using money to vanquish disaster…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Zhong Liao and Wei Feng could only console themselves like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, the ratio for obtaining 20 successive victories next is 1 to 4. I’ve already recorded it for you.” The banker wrote down a line of words on a paper with a swing of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, the page once again ran over swiftly. The face of the banker twitched instantly when he swept the jade slip, and then he laughed dryly. “Your lucks are really good, Chen Xi has already obtained 20 successive victories. According to the ratio, the three of you are able to respectively obtain…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui interrupted the bank with a wave of his hand. “Cut the crap, continue the bet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Feng and Zhong Liao were originally delighted in their hearts, and their faces glowed. But when Mu Kui spoke out, both of them were instantly dejected, and their hearts almost bled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">20 successive victories was already lucky, yet you’re still betting he’ll obtain 30 successive victories? This, this… This is utterly impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them felt as if they were sitting on a carpet of needles. They both hoped Chen Xi would be able to create a miracle and were worried that once an accident occurs, their bets would be lost completely, causing their moods to be complicated to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the following scene caused them to be flabbergasted instead and in disbelief. Chen Xi had actually obtained 30 successive victories!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just the two of them, even the banker was dumbstruck, and he had an expression as if he’d seen a ghost. “It’s truly strange. How could an initial-stage Golden Core Realm cultivator from the southern territory possess such ferocious strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s with all the nonsense? Quickly place the bets.” Mu Kui frowned. He hated it the most when people held attitudes of doubt towards his Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can place a bet, but the ratio has to be changed. Chen Xi has already become a hot candidate now, and probably all the nearby betting areas have started bets especially for him. So…” The banker’s eyes spun before he stretched out a finger. “The ratio is 1 to 1, yes or no?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck! Are you kidding me? At any rate, the ratio for 40 successive victories ought to be at 1 to 4. You’re too black hearted. Quickly hand over the money, we won’t bet anymore.” Wei Feng glared and berated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, we won’t bet anymore!” Zhong Liao started shouting loudly as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui glanced coldly at these two people. How could he be unable to discern their thoughts? And he said right away, “How about this? Lend me the money both of you have won. I’ll take part in the bet this time, and I’ll return not the slightest bit less to the both of you if I lose.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them looked at each other, and then Wei Feng gritted his teeth. “Alright, Brother Mu Kui is one who never goes back on his words. Since you’ve spoke like this, we brothers will listen to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui grunted coldly and couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to this pair of clowns. After he settled the ratio and bet with the banker, he closed his eyes and started meditating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, an enormous exclaim of shock sounded out from the Goldlake Meeting’s venue, and the voice was like the tide that could be heard both near and far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture! Right, it’s surely the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture! This sword technique that’s reputed to be the most difficult to cultivate in the world has actually appeared in the hands of Chen Xi!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Supposedly, the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture possesses eight great sword moves. Every single sword moves contains boundless variations that are like the amount of grains of sand in a river, and it’s extremely complicated and profound. Even some formidable Talisman Formation Masters find it impossible to deduce all the changes within it. Never had I imagined that Chen Xi had cultivated it successfully, this can really be said to be unprecedented!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those variations are only its surface. Most importantly, every single sword move of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture possesses a type of Dao Insight. Even if one has grasped its variations, yet if one is unable to comprehend these eight types of Dao Insights, one would only possess its surface. Based on the sword technique Chen Xi executed, it obviously already contained the energy of Dao Insights, and it isn’t just an empty frame. It’s truly worthy of admiration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Feng and Zhong Liao’s hearts jerked when they heard the clamorous discussion from outside, and they were extremely shocked. Obviously, they’d heard of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture’s reputation as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, the situation of the battles had come out. Chen Xi had relied on the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture to easily obtain 40 successive victories!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the intestines of Zhong Liao and Wei Feng went green with regret.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If we knew earlier, why would we have shrunk back? Now Mu Kui has benefited from it, and he used our capital he borrowed from us to earn a fortune…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Continue, continue.” Mu Kui laughed heartily and extremely happily. As he spoke, he asked the two of them. “Do the both of you want to join?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Wei Feng and Zhong Liao spoke at the exact same time. They knew that there was a chance to obtain a great fortune if they participated, and if they didn’t, they would absolutely regret it for their entire lifetimes. As for what if they lost it, their capital was only 30,000 and 50,000 respectively.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if we lose it, it isn’t like we can’t afford it, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are the both of you sure?” The banker’s expression was already extremely unsightly. The ratio was 1 to 1, and if it continued like this, then he would be losing money repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The banker was helpless and could only record it down, yet he was already burning with anxiety and cursing in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Have all those experts died? Why aren’t they making a move to fiercely crush this fellow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeming to have heard the voice in the banker’s heart, an exclaim of shock once again exploded out from the venue of the Goldlake Meeting. “My god! The number 1 combat ring’s Ji Yue actually wants to challenge the number 3 combat ring’s Chen Xi!”</span></p>
