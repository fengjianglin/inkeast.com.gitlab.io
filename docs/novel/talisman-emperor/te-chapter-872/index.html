 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

The key was that were a few great figures from the Immortal Dimension that had come along with them, and they were discussing matters with the Three Sages of Nine Radiance in the depths of Divine Radiance Peak, and once they were alarmed, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three Sages of Nine Radiance were the top three figures amongst the seniors that lived in seclusion within the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, and they were respectively Fei Ling, Feng Ting, and Deng Chen. It wasn’t exaggerated to say that the existence of these three seniors was like a pillar that held up the sky, and they guarded the Nine Radiance Sword Sect and made it so that no one dared to come offend the sect.</span></p>

Thus, it obviously displayed how lofty the status of these great figures was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, when Chen Xi heard that Mei Qingyuan wanted him to die to atone for his crimes, Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed while cold lights flashed within, and he lightly spat out a few words. “The death of trash like all of you is nothing to be regretted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it’s like that, then die!” Mei Qingyuan’s expression was extremely gloomy, and with a wave of his hand, all the young men and young women by his side moved out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill! Kill this ant! No matter who it is, if someone dares to obstruct me today, then that person will be a sworn enemy of this Young Master!”</span></p>

Dao Arts rumbles while magic treasures whistled, and if it wasn’t for the protection of the grand formation within the hall, merely this moment was sufficient to flatten the entire True Martial Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this chaos, Chen Xi executed the Wings of Disruption, and he was like a flowing ray of light that flickered repeatedly in space, and he moved about indeterminately like a ghost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

A young man was caught off guard, causing his neck to be directly grabbed by a hand that arrived abruptly, and then he was lifted up like a chick before being smashed into the ground. An enormous hole was smashed open by his body, causing him to bleed from all seven apertures while his entire body convulsed before he fainted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Wang!” The nearby Junior Sister Zhu let out a sharp cry of shock and fury when she saw this, and then her sleeves fluttered as they struck down at Chen Xi’s neck like two venomous dragons. But before her attack could approach him, an enormous and thick fist that was coiled by the violent glow of lightning whistled over and rapidly enlarged within her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">AH!</span></p>

Everywhere he passed, no one was capable of bearing the brunt of his might!</span></p>

So when he faced these profligate disciples from the Immortal Dimension that were at most at the 4</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level of the Earthly Immortal Realm, it was simply as if he was sweeping through dried leaves, and he was all powerful and seemed unstoppable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous disciples had gathered outside the hall since an unknown moment in time. Shockingly, An Wei, Long Zhenbei, Chen Langya, Luo Qianrong, and the other Core Seed Disciples were amongst these disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, they’d come after hearing the news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice! I’ve already had enough of these bastards in these past few days. If it wasn’t for my strength being insufficient, I would have surely bashed these bastards to the point of crying for their mother and father just like Chen Xi!” Long Zhenbei clenched his fists as he watched Chen Xi revealed invincible martial prowess and sweep through everyone in the surroundings. He was extremely excited in his heart as well, and he truly wished for nothing more than to howl up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since these profligate disciples from the Immortal Dimension arrived at the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, the entire Nine Radiance Sword Sect was covered in a foul atmosphere because of them, and it just so happened that the higher-ups paid no attention to this, causing them to be extremely aggrieved in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, they were extremely worried when they heard Chen Xi had returned today. After all, everyone in the sect knew that Mei Qingyuan had taken Chen Xi to be an enemy because of Xueyan, and if Chen Xi returned, Chen Xi would probably meet with calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the scenes before their eyes now clearly told them that Chen Xi didn’t meet with calamity, and it was these profligate disciples from the Immortal Dimension that had met with calamity instead. So how could they who’d been aggrieved for so long not be excited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never expected that after a short one year of not seeing each other, Chen Xi’s strength has actually arrived at such an extent!” Chen Langya muttered. Besides exclaiming with admiration, a wisp of a complicated feeling couldn’t help but arise in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s truly difficult to chase after the footsteps of this fellow…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is satisfying. But I’m very worried that Chen Xi’s situation will become very bad after he did this.” An Wei’s beautiful brows knit together while her gorgeous face was suffused with a wisp of worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Core Seed Disciples, all of them were naturally aware that these profligate disciples from the Immortal Dimension dared to act in such an unbridled manner because they had something to rely on. Not to mention their background and identities, merely those great figures that had come along with them weren’t figures that anyone in the sect dared to offend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they found out about what had occurred here, then how could those great figures from the Immortal Dimension possibly let Chen Xi off?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The excited expressions on the faces of the other disciples gradually faded when they heard this, and then a wisp of worry appeared between their brows.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, it’s satisfying to bash them up, but how will Chen Xi deal with the aftermath?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in next to no time, their attention was drawn by a scene that occurred within the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the entire hall, all those profligate disciples from the Immortal Dimension lay scattered on the ground with swollen faces and bathed in blood while they groaned and howled without end. But most of them had already fainted, and they seemed to be rather miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Mei Qingyuan was the only person left standing, and his expression was gloomy to the limit. No matter how he wracked his brains, he was unable to figure out how a tiny ant at the Nether Transformation Realm was actually able to sweep through a group of Earthly Immortal Realm experts!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention him, even the Sect Master and Lie Peng’s expressions were strange because a cultivator at the Nether Transformation Realm had put down a group of Earthly Immortal Realm experts like an autumn breeze that swept away fallen leaves. Such a visual impact was simply strong to an unparalleled level, and it caused both of them to be extremely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How… How did you achieve this?” asked Mei Qingyuan. Even he himself didn’t notice that his voice carried a trace of trembling that couldn’t be restrained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kneel down and beg me, and I’ll tell you,” said Chen Xi calmly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Fellow, do you know the consequences of offending this Young Master?! Don’t think that you’ve so extraordinary just because you can surmount a realm to do battle. If this Young Master wants to kill you, then no one in this world can save you!” Mei Qingyuan was furious when he heard this. As the descendant of a great figure from the Immortal Dimension, even if he felt slight fear in his heart towards Chen Xi’s strength, the domineering disposition he’d fostered for many years caused him to be unable to accept someone daring to trample on his dignity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a joke! Even if you have the status of someone from the Immortal Dimension, you’re just a pile of dog shit. Yet you still dare threaten me?” At this moment, Chen Xi was overbearing and domineering, and he carried a dignified bearing of supremacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You called me dog shit?” Mei Qingyuan was angered to the point his entire body started trembling, and his eyes burned with flames of rage while he gnashed his teeth to the point they almost shattered apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was mistaken, you’re worse than dog shit.” Chen Xi said indifferently, “I forgot to tell you, I just killed a group of trash that felt they were superior because the possessed backgrounds from the Immortal Dimension just like you. If you remain unconvinced, then feel free to try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, everyone including Wen Huating and Lie Peng were shocked and felt disbelief.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi actually said that he killed the descendants of immortals in the past? Moreover, it wasn’t one but a group!?</span></p>

But when everyone recalled everything Chen Xi had said and done in these past few years, they were very sure that Chen Xi ought to not lie at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they thought up to here, the gazes everyone shot at Chen Xi changed, and they seemed as if they were looking at a freak that couldn’t be judged by convention.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tiny ant actually dares to humiliate me like this!?</span></p>

Suddenly, his gaze swept out as his hands crossed each other, and then he punched fiercely at Chen Xi.</span></p>

Space shattered and collapsed before transforming into an expanse of darkness, a realm of darkness.</span></p>

Immortal Punishment of Darkness!” A terrifying punch spread out and enveloped Chen Xi like the night, and it seemed as if it intended to confine Chen Xi within a purgatory of darkness and completely suppress him there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a terrifying Immortal Art that had already exceeded the scope of Dao Arts. Even though it was executed with Mei Qingyuan’s Dao Insights and not the energy of the Laws, its might was still extremely terrifying.</span></p>

It seemed like a scorching sun had arisen from behind him, and it was dazzling, vast, brilliant, and blazing. As soon as it spread out, it torn apart all darkness.</span></p>
