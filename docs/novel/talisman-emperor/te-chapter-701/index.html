Their movements were uniform and orderly as if they were cast from the same mold and not the slightest bit different.</span></p>

Due to them being overly orderly, the heaven shaking sound of them tearing through space seemed as if it was caused by a single person instead.</span></p>

Those remaining 20 plus enemies of theirs didn’t even have the time to dodge before they were smashed into mush by the youths that had transformed into giants with six arms and three heads, and it was an extremely horrifying scene.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sudden assault caused a trace of restlessness and panic to arise in the enemy forces, and before they could react, Scarface and Baldy led the teams that guarded the flames to launch the second round of attacks without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>

Its attacks were sharp like blades, its defense strong like a fort, and it didn’t have any blind spots.</span></p>

On the other hand, the enemy forces were too anxious, and their forces were too densely packed, causing this round of attacks to strike another heavy injury onto them!</span></p>

In a single move, his side had lost a few tens of people. The enemies’ attacks were obviously planned beforehand and struck down like that tide, wave after wave, and it didn’t give them the slightest time to think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that so long as they revealed the slightest sign of relaxing or a flaw, it would be grabbed onto firmly by the enemy, and their acute instincts caused the golden haired young man to feel slight disbelief.</span></p>

But he felt slightly at ease in his heart because both sides were fighting head on, and the following part of the battle would decide the victor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their side still occupied an advantageous position because not only did they possess him, a Violet Crystal Rank expert, all of those 10 Gold Rank experts remained unharmed. All those Xeno-race experts that had died earlier were Bronze Rank and Silver Rank experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill! Kill all these damnable natives!” The golden haired young man shouted loudly with a voice that spread far and wide. His strength at the Violet Crystal Rank caused him to be filled with confidence, and it caused him to feel that this battle was in the bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beng! Beng! Beng!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression turned grim once more. Within his field of vision, numerous exceedingly dazzling light arrows had suddenly shot out explosively, yet he felt at ease because these attacks weren’t targeted at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right after that, his heart jerked as he cursed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, the scene he was most unwilling to see had occurred. The numerous Gold Rank experts around him didn’t even have the chance to make a move before they were shot through by the light arrows, and their entire bodies were brought flying by the terrifying penetrative force of the arrows, causing blood to rain down from the sky. They were already corpses when they fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally Meng Wei that made the move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw the display of the youths from the Violet Lightning Camp and their brilliant results, his expression didn’t change in the slightest, but the palms beneath his sleeves couldn’t help but clench into fists!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d similarly never imagined that the might of this Tri-Factor Spikecharge Formation would actually be so formidable. Most importantly, the cooperation between the youths was simply flawless, and it seemed as if it was tempered through severe training, causing them to utterly not seem like greenhorns that didn’t have the slightest real combat experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battlefield was in complete disorder, yet Meng Wei’s mind was unprecedentedly calm and clear. He’d quickly noticed the leader and the 10 Gold Rank experts of the enemy force. He practically didn’t hesitate to raise the Staruin Bow and draw it to its fullest extent before exploding out with a string of light arrows that tore through the sky, and it directly annihilated numerous Gold Rank experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the gap in strength. Those Xeno-race Gold Rank experts were at most at the Rebirth Realm in terms of cultivation, whereas Meng Wei was at the Nether Transformation Realm in body refinement. Coupled with the Shaman Treasure, Staruin Bow, killing them was simply as easy as flipping his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare kill my clansmen? All of you can dream of surviving today!” The golden haired young man was furious to the point his eyes almost split apart as he stamped with rage. He stretched out his hand and made a grabbing gesture, causing a terrifying force to directly assault Blackie, Scarface, and Baldy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei had killed numerous Gold Rank experts from his side, so he wanted a tooth for a tooth. Moreover, he’d noticed a long time ago that the reason those youths from the Violet Lightning Camp were so formidable was firstly because of their tacit cooperation and secondly because of the command of those three youths in the lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So long as he killed these three youths, everything would collapse by itself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his killing move was obstructed right at the moment it was executed, and a robust and stalwart figure appeared near him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m your opponent,” said Meng Wei coldly. As he spoke, his arm curved to draw the Staruin Bow before releasing a flurry of dazzling light arrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! You’re courting death! You’ve truly come to give your life away!” The golden haired young man stared laughing from extreme anger while his expression was utterly savage. He soared over like a golden roc while coiled with dazzling golden light, and he struck out with an expanse of golden radiance with a raise of his hand before causing it to smash down at Meng Wei.</span></p>

They fought to the point the heavens collapsed as the earth split apart, and the entire heavens and the earth were cast into a shadow.</span></p>

They cultivated desperately day and night, and practically every single one of them had experienced cultivating too much to the point of spitting blood and fainting.</span></p>
