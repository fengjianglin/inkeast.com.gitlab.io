 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is too irritating. His tone seems as if I’m shamelessly asking him to get to know me. He’s truly detestable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Baili Yan gnashed her teeth with hatred before turning around with indignation. However, she didn’t leave but intended to stay at the side and calm her feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was very worried that if this were to continue, then she would surely be angered to the point of getting into a fight with Chen Xi, and that wasn’t her original intention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Baili Yan left, the two old servants behind her naturally left along with her, and the gazes of everyone started to move towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some young men were even extremely delighted when they saw this, and they swarmed over like a swarm of lascivious men that did everything in their power to please her because they wanted to form a relationship with this young woman with an otherworldly appearance and mysterious origins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, Baili Yan was surrounded like a true bright moon that was surrounded by a host of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, some people of the older generation with ample experience had already discerned that this peerlessly beautiful young woman surely possessed an extraordinary background, so they warned all their juniors not to act rashly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still many people that shot their gazes towards Chen Xi. After all, all of them noticed that since this young man actually dared to speak like that to the peerlessly beautiful young woman, his background would probably not be simple as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Tianshuo didn’t leave either. As the owner the estate, he would naturally not be short-sighted to the point of thinking that a young man who dared speak like this to Baili Yan was a rash and ignorant young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then may I know Young Hero’s name?” In the next moment, Wen Tianshuo spoke with a warm smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My surname is Chen.” Chen Xi replied yet wasn’t willing to reveal his identity. He’d come for the sake of taking a disciple this time, and if they were to find out about his identity, then their attitudes would surely change greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was like that, he was very sure that the possibility of him successfully taking a disciple would increase greatly, but he would be unable to comprehensively observe exactly what sort of person this potential disciple of his was. In this way, he might become prejudiced, and this wasn’t something that he hoped to see happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so it’s Young Hero Chen.” Wen Tianshuo completely didn’t mind that Chen Xi was unwilling to reveal his identity, and he said with a smile, “I presume Young Hero Chen has come for the sake of my son, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly, I’ve come for the sake of taking a disciple.” Chen Xi nodded and spoke sparingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what do you think about my son?” Wen Tianshuo had a burning gaze as he asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m temporarily unable to discern anything, and it will depend on my assessment,” replied Chen Xi. From the beginning until the end, he didn’t even spare a glance at the nearby Wen Hua.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His attitude caused Wen Tianshuo to be unable to help but be stunned, and he seemed to be lost in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his son, Wen Hua, was slightly displeased in his heart because he was still young and impetuous. As the Junior Marquis, he received solemn treatment wherever he went. For example, in these recent days, even if those experts of the various powers saw him, all of them would praise him repeatedly and were extremely approving of him. There was rarely anyone that was indifferent like Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with Chen Xi’s young and unfamiliar appearance, and Chen Xi having come here alone. Moreover, merely based on outward appearances, he didn’t seem like an expert that came from a large sect. So all of this caused Wen Hua to feel slight aversion towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though he was young, he was absolutely not a rash person, and he’d sensed a trace of unusualness from his father’s attitude towards Chen Xi, so he’d constantly restrained the feelings in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, when he heard that Chen Xi was even stingy with an evaluation, he was slightly unable to restrain himself and couldn’t help but ask. “Young Master Chen, may I know exactly what sort of assessments are needed to become your disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, it instantly drew the attention of many because some that had come here this time them were representatives of the various powers that were determined to take Wen Hua as a disciple for their sects, so all of them walked forward with vigilant expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They seemed as if they were deeply afraid that the meat in their plate would be snatched away by someone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi glanced inadvertently at Wen Hua when he heard this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little fellow looks to be respectful, yet he intentionally raised his voice slightly when he spoke these words to draw the attention of everyone. He undoubtedly wants to rely on the influence of the others to test me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, since he possessed such a scheming ability at a young age, he could really be considered to be wise and intelligent, but Chen Xi didn’t like others playing such tricks before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My assessment is very simple. Even if the person that I chose possesses inferior natural endowments, I’ll surely foster him with all my might, whereas if it isn’t someone I select, then even if the person is an innate saint, that person would be like trash to me and would be of no consequence.” Chen Xi replied indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Hua’s brows raised as he discerned the warning within Chen Xi’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Tianshuo patted Wen Hua on the shoulder to indicate that Wen Hua should calm down. He was similarly slightly displeased by Chen Xi’s words, but he wouldn’t display it on his face because he still possessed this level of subtlety.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But someone was unable to restrain himself. An old man with grey hair and beard sneered. “How conceited! Everyone in the world knows that cultivation is difficult, so how could a weakling be compared with a genius?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone else said coldly, “I have to say, this friend is too naïve. Selecting a disciple and passing on the Dao is such an important matter, and it’s related to the flame of inheritance of a sect. If one only takes in those of inferior natural endowment, then the Dao inheritance of a sect will be destroyed in no time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone was even more direct, and he berated. “You’re simply treating it like child’s play! Cut the crap!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi seemed to have become a criminal that had been condemned by the public, and he was stared at furiously by everyone. A commotion like this caused the gazes of everyone in the surroundings to be drawn over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Baili Yan was sneering in her heart.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;These bastards are really ignorant. If they find out about Chen Xi’s identity, then their expressions would probably be very colorful, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, she didn’t have any intention to expose Chen Xi’s identity because if she did that, it would only grow Chen Xi’s influence, and she wasn’t willing to see that scene occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expressions remained unchanged, and he seemed carefree as he silently listened to everyone ‘denounce’ him. He waited until they spoke to the point their mouths were dry before he swept everyone with his gaze. “Are all of you finished?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone couldn’t help but be stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of attitude is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Marquis, there are too many people in the world that gain a reputation by deceit now. If you’re going to select a master for the Junior Marquis, then you have to be careful, so as to avoid holding back the Junior Marquis’s outstanding talent.” Someone suggested to Wen Tianshuo.</span></p>

I wonder if Young Hero Chen will have a spar with me and broaden my horizons?”</span></p>
