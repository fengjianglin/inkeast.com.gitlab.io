 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he stretched open his arms, causing a strand of surging Immortal Energy to gush out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

They interweaved together to form expanses of complicated and dense formations that flowed with brilliant light, and they were extraordinarily beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, countless formations converged together and roiled endlessly as they emanated a myriad of rays of azure brilliance, and at the center of them all was surging specks of illusory and faint nether flames!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nether flames seemed like a mist yet weren’t a mist, seem like clouds yet weren’t clouds, they revealed a piercingly cold and deep black color and seemed like numerous black colored stars that ornamented the surging azure colored flaming radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s gaze was like a bolt of lightning as he flicked his sleeve and lightly spat out a single word. “Form!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous misty and enormous green barriers enveloped the gorge like overturned bowls, and their surfaces surged with countless talisman markings. A light flashed as if they formation took a breath, and then it vanished instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked at solely from its outward appearance, this gorge was still as before, exceedingly ordinary and inconspicuous in this desolate and deathly still Ninth Hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Chen Xi knew how terrifying this Azuresun Netherflame Formation was, and once it was sufficient to annihilate a Nether Transformation Realm expert upon activation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defensive strength of the grand formation was extremely formidable as it converged the ability of ‘illusion,’ ‘slaughter,’ and ‘defense’ in one. If it wasn’t for him not possessing sufficient materials, the might of the formation would be even more formidable, and even Earthly Immortal Realm experts would find it impossible to break through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi quickly abandoned all unpractical thoughts because the spirit materials in his possession had already been completely cleaned out by this grand formation, and it was only wishful thinking if he continued thinking about anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the youths were cultivating extremely painstakingly within the gorge. After they experienced the baptism of countless battles and unexpected events, their immature and young faces carried a strand of steadiness and maturity between their brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya and Meng Wei stood at the side while supervising their cultivation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They knew that if it wasn’t for protecting their safety in the previous battles, it would be impossible for the old priest and those guards to have perished!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This allowed them to deeply understand a principle, and it was that a weak strength would only be a burden to seniors and companions by one’s side. So regardless of if it was for themselves or their companions, they had to become stronger! Only by becoming stronger would they be able to continue living and allow their companions and seniors to cease their worry!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi noticed this scene upon returning to the gorge, and he didn’t say anything before turning around to return to his tent. He didn’t waste any time and sat down cross-legged before starting to deduce in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to start constructing his Blackhole World, and he had to make the best use of every minute of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on the information he’d obtained earlier, he was clearly aware that there was a passageway that led to the outside world 45,000km away from here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This passageway appeared by itself after the Xeno-race experts broke open the dimensional walls of the Ninth Hell, and it had been discovered by the Xeno-race first, causing them to station six teams to guard it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst them was supposedly a General Rank expert holding down the fort, and this expert’s strength was entirely comparable with an Earthly Immortal Realm expert!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wanted to lead the clansmen of the Ninth Hell tribe out to the outside world, then they had to charge through the defenses of the enemy and even had to escape right under the nose of a General Rank expert, and there was no other way besides this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi knew extremely clearly that it was absolutely like throwing an egg against a rock if he attacked forcefully with their current strength, and they would die without a doubt. So, he chose this gorge and intended to make sufficient preparations before making a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he had other considerations when choosing this gorge. All along the way, they’d annihilated a total of six Xeno-race teams, and there were still another 30 Xeno-race teams tasked with stopping and killing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an extremely shocking number!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, every single team had a Violet Crystal Rank expert and 10 Gold Rank experts amongst them. Once all of them were converged together, then it would absolutely be a terrifying nightmare to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, as far as Chen Xi was concerned, this nightmare would surely come true. Because they’d exposed too much of their tracks and information during these few days of advancement, and so long as the enemy wasn’t stupid, the enemy would surely have guessed a long time ago that they were not far away from the passageway that led to the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances, it was extremely likely that the remaining 30 teams of Xeno-race experts would converge together and stand on guard before the passageway with the intention of waiting for the rabbit to jump into the trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the other objective Chen Xi had when choosing this gorge was to make this gorge their base camp while they recuperated and built up energy, and then carry out round after round of plans and actions against their enemies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only in this way would they be able to weaken the threat posed by their enemies to the greatest extent.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the time for an incense stick to burn, Chen Xi awoke from his deep contemplation and deducing, and he took a deep breath and didn’t hesitate in the slightest to make his Divine Sense seem like strands of tiny and swift tentacles that enveloped every single inch of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His meridians had been nourished by the Immortal Energy emitted by the Dark Parasol sapling to the point of being extremely tough and tensile, and it was comparable to a magic treasure. So it was obviously countless times more difficult to inscribe talisman markings on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t like drawing talisman markings on talisman paper, and it was even more alike to carving on hard rock with an iron awl. Every single stroke and line required him spending an enormous amount of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, his meridians were too fine, so it was much more difficult to inscribe numerous dense and profound talisman markings on it. Once the slightest mistake was to appear, then not only would all his previous work be in vain, it would even harm his meridians, and the consequences were unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi had already mentally prepared himself for all this, so he didn’t feel nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, his entire mind was converged onto his meridians, causing his mind to be empty as if he’d returned to those years of his youth where he crafted and sole talismans, and he carried a concentrated expression while being completely oblivious to himself.</span></p>

At the instant it condensed into form, it actually emitted a strand of shocking energy of devour!</span></p>

Then, he would use this as the foundation to converge the energy within his body and re-open a world within his Dantian and re-construct a new Blackhole World!</span></p>

Along with the ceaseless inscribing, his technique became even more skilled while his understand of the Dao of Talismans gradually deepened, causing the speed he inscribed at to grow faster and faster.</span></p>

They were like a multitude of gorgeous flowers that bloomed on every inch of his body, and they were suffused with a mysterious and deep sheen that was illusory and misty.</span></p>

The metal, wood, fire, water, earth, wind, lightning, star…all these profundities were condensed with the structure of the Devour Dao Insight, causing various profound comprehensions to flow through his heart like a stream.</span></p>

He could only rely on himself to find the correct method and complete it.</span></p>
