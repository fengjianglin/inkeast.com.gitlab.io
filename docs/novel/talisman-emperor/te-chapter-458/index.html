Everyone present here was terrified, they rarely met anyone that could go against them amongst them peers, yet they noticed their lives weren’t worth a cent here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smell of blood within the ruins assaulted the air as slaughters were being carried out all over, and it was a sight so horrifying one couldn’t bear to look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scenes like this only stopped two hours later, whereas the vast beast tide had retreated and the ten plus treasures of the gods that commanded the beast tide had vanished along with it as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavens and the earth returned to calm once more, but the air contained a dense bloody aura, whereas the dazzling and resplendent glow of treasures occasionally charged into the sky from the distant ruins and were like comets that streaked through the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But everyone wasn’t so covetous anymore, and they instead felt extremely icy cold as everything in the ruins was too terrifying. Extremely formidable ferocious beasts were actually commanded by the treasures left behind by the gods, and such might was simply capable of destroying everything and nothing could stop it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast tide had really dispersed, yet an entire few hundreds of genius experts had died at the hands of the beast tide, causing their corpses to lay on the ruins and taint the rubble and ruined buildings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people had aroused the intention to retreat. The Isle of Fallen Treasures was simply like a den of devils. Even though treasures were good, they weren’t as important as one’s life, and the slightest carelessness could cost them their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was in a sorry state and had tattered clothes as he stood up straight within the ruins. He was a member of the great army of people that were fleeing, and he’d safely avoided this calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s really terrifying. Who would have thought that the ferocious beasts on the Isle of Fallen Treasures would actually be so terrifying?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi rubbed his left shoulder. The spot he rubbed had been slit open by the fangs of an enormous lizard, but it had already healed now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, he’d long since become separated from Huangfu Qingying, Young Master Zhou, Pei Yu, and the others. Because the beast tide was too terrifying and had crushed down while emitting a rumbling sound, they were utterly unable to stay gathered together for the sake of escaping with their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes squinted as he swiftly avoided it. The sword light was like a ray that swiftly brushed past him before slicing apart a 50,000kg enormous rock that was ahead of him, and the place it was sliced was smooth like a mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword strike was extremely sharp and terrifying. Obviously, the person that executed it had flawlessly combined the Grand Dao of Metal into their sword move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person that sneak attacked him was a black clothed young man, and he decisively retreated explosively without the slightest hesitation when his strike missed, and he seemed to know how formidable Chen Xi was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But how could Chen Xi let his enemy slip through his fingers? He executed the Starsky Wings right away, and with a few flickers, he’d already appeared behind the black clothed young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s impolite not to reciprocate!” Chen Xi’s Talisman Armament soared through the sky like a flash as the piercingly cold Sword Insight transformed into a stream that swept out like this enemy’s move, and he intended to slash his enemy apart from the waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sparks sprayed out. At the critical moment, the black clothed young man had stopped and turned around before suddenly moving his sword to block before him. Even though he’s blocked this sword strike that struck towards his waist, he was blasted flying and staggered to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? So you’re a member of the Eastern Summer Kingdom? No wonder you dared to launch a sneak attack at me.” The hair of the black clothed young man was disheveled, and his true appearance was revealed, causing him to be instantly recognized by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this way, I can’t let you live!” Chen Xi didn’t hold back in the slightest. The Talisman Armament let out a clear howl as it flashed through the sky, and then a dazzling sword light that surged with Dao insight slashed down once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the black clothed young man was formidable and far surpassed ordinary geniuses, how could he be a match for Chen Xi? After he successively resisted a few sword strikes of Chen Xi’s, his entire body had already been shaken to the point blood flowed from all his five aperture of the face, and even a few of his bones had been broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi struck out once more with his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clothed young was already extremely terrified since long ago. When he faced this sword strike, he gritted his teeth in the end and crushed the Universe Teleportation Talisman in his hand, causing him to instantly vanish on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Universe Teleportation Talisman again.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned. This type of jade talisman contained the profundities of the Spatial Grand Dao, and it was something only Earthly Immortal Realm experts were capable of refining. Moreover, there was utterly no way to effectively counter it. For example, Xu Lengye who he’d met before had relied on this talisman to escape calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like I have to be even more ruthless and decisive when I encounter another enemy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed, and Chen Xi had entered the depths of the ruins. During this process, another few more beast tides had arisen, and he’d already gradually grasped its pattern. After a beast tide, there was bound to be two days of a peaceful and dormant period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mountains formed into a forest before him, and every single one of them were extremely tall and precipitous. Moreover, some mountains frequently flashed with a strand of the light of treasure, and the sound of battle could be heard faintly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is the depths of the ruins and the beast tide gathers here. But compared to the outside world, it’s much safer. Moreover, there seems to be numerous treasures hidden here.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi spoke in a light voice. According to his estimations, the deeper he went into the depths of the ruins, the safer he would be, whereas the outer area of the ruins was the place that it was the easiest to suffer the invasion and collision of the best side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like it isn’t just me who has figured out the situation, and many people seem to have already arrived here long ago.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Chen Xi also noticed the sounds of battle that resounded out from the extremely distant mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became cautious in his heart, as none of those who were able to safely arrive here would be weaklings, and they were existences with extraordinary ability and terrifying strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi silently arrived before the mountain and when he saw the parties to the battle weren’t Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou, Chen Xi turned around and continued moving towards the depths of the ruins.</span></p>
