It was dense like a river of stars, vast like a sea of clouds, and even a Talisman Formation Master that was skilled in deduction would find it difficult to deduce all its variations.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture was divided into eight levels, each more difficult than the other, and one that was capable of learning its basics was sufficient to be called a genius that shocked the world, whereas one that was capable of cultivating it to the highest level was one in a million, rare to come by in a thousand years!</span></p>

It was as if they were admiring the most grand and magnificent landscape painting in the world, and a wisp of heartfelt feelings of affection towards a genius arose in their hearts.</span></p>

The pressure Qing Xiuyi brought upon him this time had allowed him to develop the enormous potential of his soul, and he’d finally broken through the final barrier of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture and combined them to attain the highest and perfect level.</span></p>

Every single move broke through the barriers that caged him and allowed him to comprehend nature and its myriad of changes, and various Dao Insights were converged within his strike, causing its might to rise explosively by a few times than normal!</span></p>

They were capable of becoming stronger in adverse circumstances and exploded out with various potential that was greater than normal.

On the other hand, Chen Xi’s potential was tempered from countless arduous battles, and it was something that was fostered later on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Light glowed brilliantly from her entire body and covered the world, the lights seemed material and formed numerous flames of light that contained terrifying incinerating energy, and it faintly emitted a sacred, vast, and mysterious sacrificial feeling that caused others to be unable to help but want to prostrate themselves in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Light of Sacred Sacrifice! A sacrifice of one’s own lifespan as an offering to light in exchange for obtaining strength that’s a few times stronger than normal! Chen Xi actually forced her to use her lifespan to fight desperately…” The pupils of all the Earthly Immortal Realm experts constricted abruptly as they’d recognized this formidable and terrifying perfect Dao Grade martial technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Light of Sacred Sacrifice was a perfect Dao Grade martial technique that was connected with the quintessence profundities of the heavens and the earth. It utilized a pure and sincere heart and supremely firm will to condense the profundities of the martial technique, and it combined with the spirit energy of the heavens and the earth to offer sacrifice to the light in order to draw from the terrifying might of the quintessence profundities of light. Once it was executed, one was capable of controlling light to subdue gods and bring chaos to the world!</span></p>

Instantly, a bottomless pit was blazed open, and practically all the talisman formations set up by Emperor Chu at the bottom of the arena was destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is the Flame of Sacred Sacrifice that’s formed from the Light of Sacred Sacrifice. It melts and destroys all. Supposedly, when cultivated to the limit, it’s even capable of summoning Light Spirits that’re formed in nature, and they were sufficient to boil seas, incinerate mountains, and destroy the stars and moon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But since ancient times, cultivators that were capable of cultivating the Light of Sacred Sacrifice to the limit only existed in the Dark Reverie, and it’s utterly impossible to see such a cultivator in the plane we’re on.”</span></p>

By relying on her natural talent, perhaps Qing Xiuyi will be capable of becoming the first cultivator in our Darchu Dynasty to cultivate the Light of Sacred Sacrifice to the limit.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle was really full of ups and downs, and it had only been carried out for less than 10 minutes, yet numerous shocking changes had occurred.</span></p>

In the blink of an eye, numerous bloody holes were burnt upon Chen Xi’s body.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his body refinement cultivation was sufficient to allow him to be regrow himself, it wasn’t enough before the Flames of Sacred Sacrifice. Because this energy of light was capable of instantly incinerating his body, and it would utterly not give him the time to repair his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, Chen Xi was charging with his life!</span></p>

I know how to do that as well!” Qing Xiuyi’s clear eyes squinted when she saw this. She knew that if Chen Xi was capable of charging over, then she would probably fall into a disadvantaged situation.</span></p>

You’re thinking of breaking through the envelopment of my Flames of Sacred Sacrifice? Dream on! You’ve taken my purity, so you must pay with your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiss! Hiss!</span></p>

If one wanted to bring forth a stronger strength, then one had to pay with one’s lifespan and offer it up as sacrifice, so that one was able to connect with the quintessence energy of light. It was a double sided blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi had already consumed a great deal of lifespan earlier. At this moment, she ruthlessly executed it once more, and she was unable to endure it with her cultivation, causing her to instantly suffer from a backlash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Qing Xiuyi didn’t care about all this at this moment. No matter what, she was absolutely unable to tolerate Chen Xi defeating her and continue living.&nbsp;</span></p>

The strands of seemingly translucent flames were like the divine flames stolen from the lantern of the gods, and it ceaselessly shot towards Chen Xi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, Chen Xi felt as if his body was about to be incinerated as boundless pain seemed like teeth of a saw that was swallowing every single inch of the flesh in his entire body, causing him to be unable to help but tremble.</span></p>

Within his sea of consciousness, a tempestuous storm rose abruptly, the Fuxi Divine Status automatically floated up into appearance as a myriad of magnificent divine lights emerged from it, and the River Diagram fragments droned and trembled while emitting a peculiar fluctuation that flowed and spread out… Everything seemed to have fallen into a collapsing and chaotic state.</span></p>
