 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s fist was like a myriad of waves surging out. The Worldly Green Bell was blasted flying and left Gongyang Longfei’s control while he himself was blasted flying as well, and he bled from all seven apertures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slap! Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Chen Xi’s left arm swung out like an iron whip that could destroy the sky, and it struck fiercely onto two senior students that weren’t able to dodge in time, causing their chests to sink down while their entire bodies were smashed into the ground like sandbags. Both of them fell unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, everyone felt something flash before their eyes, and then only Liu Yiming, Xing Yuanhang, and two more senior students remained standing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt suffocated while their hearts shook violently. They felt that the Chen Xi before their eyes was simply like a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Liu Yiming and the others had a wisp of terror on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi moved forward with an even more overbearing imposing aura. Every single step he took caused the heavens and the earth to rumble, and his aura was overwhelming and impossible to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll fight you to the death!” A senior student shouted loudly as he circulated his strength, and then pushed down a mountain of bones onto Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi raised his right hand and pressed down. His fingers were like towering peaks that were suffused with the heavy Laws of Earth while his entire body was like a mountain that held up the sky rising up from the ground, and his palm easily pressed down the mountain of bones to the point it was unable to move in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pupils of this senior student constricted while he felt utter terror. This was a treasure that he’d refined after gathering the skeletons of primeval immortals. It was extremely heavy and filled with the energy of the gods. It was simply all powerful and impossible to be resisted when it smashed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet now, it had actually been easily pressed down by Chen Xi as if he was squashing a moth that didn’t know its limits and flew towards the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi swung his right hand, and the senior student and the mountain of bones were swung out together. They smashed onto the restrictions at the borders of the Dao Development Grounds and caused rumbling that shook the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hearts of everyone twitched fiercely once more.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s too strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Attack together!” At this moment, Liu Yiming’s hair was disheveled, and she was in a rather sorry state. Her beautiful face was covered in a ruthless expression because she had no way to back down, and it was too late to regret her actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, a 300m long whip in her hand tore through the sky while coiled with the Laws of Fire, and this whip carried a fierce and murderous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, to Liu Yiming’s surprise, not only had Xing Yuanhang not joined forces with her, but he actually admitted defeat while she attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I quit, I admit defeat!” As soon as he finished speaking, Xing Yuanhang was transported out by the restrictions of the grounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Liu Yiming was shocked and furious, and she didn’t dare believe her eyes and ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just her, everyone present here was stunned as well. They seemed to have never imagined that Xing Yuanhang would actually admit defeat at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was right at this moment that the whip Liu Yiming swung was grabbed by Chen Xi. He shook it lightly, and it instantly left her grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi held the whip in hand, and it transformed into a 300m long ray of light that tore through the sky, and it directly whipped Liu Yiming’s figure. It caused her clothes to tear apart while her skin split open, and she let out a shrill and miserable cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, Chen Xi had discerned that the senior students faintly showed signs of following this woman’s lead, so how could Chen Xi show mercy to the chief culprit?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slap! Slap! Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whip shook as it transformed into images that filled the sky. It was like a furious god was whipping the world to vent the flames of rage in his heart, and it struck Liu Yiming to the point of letting out shrill cries successively while she fled. Every bit of clothing on her body was in rags, while bloody marks covered her entirely, and she was in an extremely sorry and miserable state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present was horrified, and some even couldn’t bear to watch. No one had expected that Chen Xi would actually be so ruthless against a woman, and it was simply like a live display of ruthlessly destroying a flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…you’re courting death! I’ll kill you! Kill you!” Liu Yiming cried out in a shrill voice, and she was on the verge of going mad. She was forced to such an extent under the gazes of everyone present, causing her to completely lose all face, so how could she have any other considerations?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister, this is a spar on the Dao Development Grounds. It’s only a discussion of the Dao, so speaking like this is going a bit too far.” Chen Xi spoke calmly. As he spoke, his hands didn’t stop even for a moment and struck Liu Yiming to the point she wailed and howled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s enough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re only a new student! Don’t go too far!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister Yiming, quickly admit defeat. It’s greatly harmful for you if this continues.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, many senior students present here were filled with rage and they shouted furiously as they criticized Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean by going too far? Could it be that only senior students like all of you can teach others a lesson, yet others can’t teach all of you senior students a lesson? What nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Chen Xi, we support you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard those senior students criticizing Chen Xi, the new students present here were instantly displeased and cried out successively. Many of them had suffered at the hands of these senior students in the past few days, so a great deal of resentment had been accumulated in their hearts. So Chen Xi’s actions didn’t just win face for all of them new students, it even allowed them to vent their resentment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, how could they possible not support Chen Xi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This little fellow had a great deal of rage suppressed in his heart.” The distant Zhou Zhili chuckled as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! He’s so ruthless against those from his own academy, this is going a bit too far.” Zuoqiu Hong grunted coldly with displeasure instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Zhili glanced at him yet didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Liu Yiming was unable to continue persisting and admitted defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The restrictions activated and sent her out of the grounds while the other senior students like Gongyang Longfei had admitted defeat and left a long time ago after being utterly crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Liu Yiming and the other senior students had been wiped out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Chen Xi hadn’t utilized an Immortal Artifact from the beginning until the end. His combat strength was so formidable that it shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The new students cheered and seethed with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to this, the senior students were all silent while their expressions were more or less slightly unsightly. No matter how open-minded a senior student was, they maintained silence at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A new student had fought seven senior students by himself, and the new student had even obtained the final victory. This was indeed something that was upsetting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, how much is it?” Chen Xi didn’t reveal any joy towards all of this. He just asked at the first possible moment about exactly how much Starpoints he’d earned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seven people, 10,000 each, and the academy will deduct 30%. Oh, you earned around 50,000 Starpoints.” The white haired old man exclaimed with admiration as he glanced at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded and didn’t show any intention to leave the Dao Development Ground. His gaze swept out like a wisp of cold lightning as soon as he raised his head, and it swept past all the senior students present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, as they sensed Chen Xi’s gaze, all the discussions in the surroundings unconsciously reduces before the surroundings quickly became silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I said it earlier, I’ll accompany all of you until the end. Does anyone else desire to spar with me, Chen Xi? Feel free to come forward. Of course, remember to bet with your Starpoints. If you miss it today, then I won’t accompany you in the future.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was calm and wasn’t loud, yet it was heard clearly by everyone amidst this perfectly silent atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the new students were stirred and felt extremely excited. Never had they imagined that Chen Xi would actually be so overbearing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Accompany them until the end? Could it be that he intends to defeat all the senior students in the outer court?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, these words had become an extreme provocation in the ears of those senior students. But after they witnessed Chen Xi’s combat strength from before, they didn’t dare rashly go forward and challenge Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It couldn’t be helped, Chen Xi’s combat strength in the Mysterious Immortal Realm was truly too extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Ning Meng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Ning Meng, quickly make a move and teach this kid a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, please make a move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, the gazes of all the senior students shot towards a single person in unison. It was an extremely handsome young man with a feminine bearing. It was exactly Ning Meng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Chen Xi swept his gaze over as well while revealing a calm expression that caused others to be unable to discern what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the gazes of everyone present, Nine Meng grinned instead and said something that exceeded the expectations of all. “Junior Brother Chen Xi’s might is overwhelming. I’m not a match for him, so I won’t make a fool of myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he finished speaking, he left swiftly and paid no attention to the gazes of anticipation from everyone in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was silent, and their feelings were complicated. Amongst all of these senior students of the outer court, Ning Meng was the strongest at the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Now he had actually admitted being inferior to Chen Xi before turning around and leaving, it was utterly impossible for them to accept.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was slightly stunned, and then he glanced at Ning Meng’s leaving figure before withdrawing his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ning Meng’s departure caused an uproar, and it was a great blow to the senior students’ morale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That damnable bastard actually dared to refuse the fight!” In the crowd, Zuoqiu Jun’s expression sank slightly while his gaze was icy cold to the limit. Never had he expected that Ning Meng would suddenly do this, and it caught him slightly off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother, should we find an opportunity to help him clear his mind?” Zuoqiu Chuan gnashed his teeth. This was something that he’d gone to carry out himself, yet it had failed now, so it caused him to lose face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no rush. Let’s deal with this kid first. Right, has that fellow come?” Zuoqiu Jun asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Chuan was stunned, and then he glanced hesitantly at the surroundings. “It ought to be…soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun’s brows knit together even more tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a wave of bustling noise resounded, and it drew the attention of all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Jun raised his eyes and looked over. When he saw a familiar figure appear at the Dao Development Grounds, a wisp of a relaxed smile instantly suffused the corners of his mouth. “He really has come. I knew he wouldn’t be able to sit idly by.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, far away from the Dao Development Grounds, Zuoqiu Hong said with a displeased expression, “The students of the outer court really have no backbone these days. It was only a spar, yet he actually didn’t dare fight before admitting defeat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was naturally speaking about Ning Meng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Zhili frowned and said, “Whether to spar or not is something between the students. Don’t force your will onto others, because that’s the greatest taboo of the academy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Hong was stunned, and he perceived that Zhou Zhili was warning him. However, he didn’t take it seriously while he sneered in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A taboo? Can it be more important than the interests of my clan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm? Why has a figure from the Allheaven Golden Rankings made a move?” Zhou Zhili gazed at the grounds, and when he saw that figure that suddenly made an appearance, his reserved and stern face revealed a rare trace of fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Hong’s heart jerked as he hurriedly looked over. Sure enough, he saw that Liu Zefeng who was ranked at the 8</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position on the Allheaven Golden Rankings had actually appeared before the grounds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That kid A’Jun really acted a bit too ruthlessly…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Hong sighed in his heart, yet he said with a smile, “Haha! It’s only a spar between students of the academy, so it should be of no consequence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” Zhou Zhili grunted coldly and pondered with a frown for a long time, and he didn’t say anything in the end.</span></p>
