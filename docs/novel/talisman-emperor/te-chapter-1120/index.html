 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within Iris Continent’s Martial Soul Hall, Zuoqiu Ke sat upright at the seat of the host in the grand hall. She’d changed into a dark golden and classic luxurious robe, wore a feathered crown, and the space between her brows revealed a calm and indifferent expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, she was entirely filled with an indescribably dignified and supreme aura, and it was very easy for others to overlook her pretty appearance at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the seat beneath the seat of the host sat a man and a woman. The woman wore black gauze clothes and had a cold and aloof bearing, whereas the man wore black clothes, and he had a ghastly pale expression yet was steady and calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they sat within the hall that belonged to the Zuoqiu Clan and sensed the solemn and dignified atmosphere within the hall, Yin Miaomiao’s expression seemed very calm as usual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu was the same as well. However, Zuoqiu Ke acutely noticed that Jiang Zhuliu’s finger that held his tea cup was slightly stiff, and he was definitely slightly nervous in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought up to here, Zuoqiu Ke felt even more contempt towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number one expert on the Southbridge Continent’s Continental Ascensio Rankings? &nbsp;One that hasn’t seen the world like him is only a bumpkin of lowly and poor birth in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she thought like this in her heart, Zuoqiu Ke directly shot her gaze at Yin Miaomiao. Comparatively speaking, Yin Miaomiao that came from an ancient clan renowned in the Dao of Talismans was barely able to make Zuoqiu Ke think highly of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was her pride as a disciple of one of the seven great ancient clans. No matter how high one’s cultivation was, the gap in each other’s identity and resources caused her to be utterly unable to think highly of the person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The minute changes in Zuoqiu Ke’s gaze weren’t concealed, and it was noticed by Jiang Zhuliu. He’d suffered this sort of contempt and disregard countless times since he was young, so he’d become accustomed to it a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely this sort of experience that allowed him to possess extraordinary tolerance, yet it didn’t mean that he wasn’t angry in his heart. Conversely, he was extremely sensitive towards this sort of disregard and contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially after he obtained the favor of the Yin Clan, his mentality had undergone a slight change. He yearned to prove himself, and he yearned to rebuild the Jiang Clan and bring glory to his ancestors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, he was already the first on Southbridge Continent’s Ascensio Immortal Rankings. Now that he obtained the full support of the Yin Clan, it was precisely a moment where he was content with the success he’d attained and felt satisfied. Yet now, he actually suffered disregard and contempt once more. This sort of feeling was like a million of needles penetrating his heart, and it caused his rage to surge and indirectly feel hatred towards Zuoqiu Ke who sat high up at the seat of the host.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But his Dao Heart that he’d tempered through many years allowed him to conceal these sort of feelings very well. Based on his outward appearance, it was utterly impossible to notice how resentful he was at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, all of this was merely because of a gaze of disregard and contempt from Zuoqiu Ke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I invited both of you here only for a single matter, and that is to go against Chen Xi during the second round of Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test. If you agree, then both of you will obtain the help of my Zuoqiu Clan, and my Zuoqiu Clan will take both of you to be one of its own.” Zuoqiu Ke spoke straightforwardly with a piercingly cold and calm voice that revealed an unquestionable tone. “I believe that both of you ought to understand the benefits of working together with my Zuoqiu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as she finished speaking, she didn’t speak another word, and then she raised up a teacup and took a light sip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sort of direct approach caused Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu to be stunned. While they were on the way here, both of them had guessed numerous possibilities in their hearts, yet never had they imagined that the Zuoqiu Clan would want to work together with them to deal with Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, they utterly didn’t dare imagined that Chen Xi would have offended the Zuoqiu Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, compared to one of the seven great ancient clans, the Zuoqiu Clan, Chen Xi was truly too tiny. One was a hawk in the sky while the other was an ant on the ground, it was like the difference between the heavens and the earth, so how could an ant offend a hawk?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was too astounding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, both of them noticed simultaneously that Zuoqiu Ke wasn’t joking. In other words, this matter was definitely true. When they thought up to here, both of them couldn’t help but have a slightly complicated feeling in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Chen Xi were to die right now, since he was able to be taken as an enemy of the Zuoqiu Clan, then it’s enough for him to take pride in, right?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu pondered silently in his heart for a long time, and then he suddenly realized a problem and said, “Young Miss Zuoqiu, that Chen Xi’s position on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings is at the 999</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position. He’ll probably be eliminated during the first round of the test, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Ke glanced at Jiang Zhuliu with an indifferent expression, and then she seemed as if she didn’t even notice him before moving her gaze onto Yin Miaomiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This subtle action caused Jiang Zhuliu’s heart to warp, and he gritted his teeth without end in secret. He swore that so long as he was able to grow into an expert, then he would surely take revenge for the humiliation he suffered today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master Jiang isn’t wrong.” Yin Miaomiao glanced at Jiang Zhuliu, and then she pondered deeply before she said, “Could it be that Young Miss Zuoqiu thinks that Chen Xi will be able to pass the first test?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu’s heart felt slightly warm upon receiving Yin Miaomiao’s affirmation, and the grievance and resentment in his heart eased up greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Ke smiled and said casually, “No matter if he’s able to pass the first round of the test or not, I only want to know if both of you are willing to work together with my Zuoqiu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She naturally wouldn’t tell them that twelve Void Guards from her clan had been annihilated at Chen Xi’s hand because that would be no different than exposing her own clan’s shame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu glanced at each other before agreeing in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason was very simple. No matter if Chen Xi was able to enter the second round of the test, so long as they were able to form a relationship with the Zuoqiu Clan, then it was extremely beneficial to them and the clans that stood behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, such a rare opportunity was something that were unable to stumble upon no matter how hard they tried. Now that it actually took the initiative to appear before them, how could they not agree?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless they were idiots, of course!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu weren’t idiots. So they were clearly aware of how rare this sort of opportunity was, and they practically didn’t give it any consideration before agreeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Ke grinned when she saw this, and she seemed to be very calm because this outcome was already within her expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She lightly clapped her hands, causing two servants to silently appear within the hall. Each of them held a jade box in their hands, and they brought it over to Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The jade boxes were opened by the servants to reveal a black and white dazzling glow of treasures that spread throughout the hall, and it emanated a shocking imposing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dragonclam Yin Yang Pearls!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu’s pupils constricted in unison as they recognized the treasure within the jade box. It was a pair of precious treasures, one Yin and the other Yang. Especially when utilized by Dao Companions during mutual cultivation, it was capable of speeding up one’s cultivation and allow one to yield twice the result with half the effort!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This precious treasure could only be chanced upon by luck, and it was utterly impossible to buy on the market.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that both of you are about to be united as Dao Companions. Take these two little toys as a gift I prepared for the both of you in advance.” Zuoqiu Ke spoke casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Young Miss Zuoqiu, for your gift.” Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu spoke in unison while they couldn’t help but reveal a trace of excitement. Both of them had never expected that they would actually be able to obtain such a precious treasure during their first meeting with Zuoqiu Ke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This obviously displayed how wealthy the Zuoqiu Clan was, and they deserved to be one of the seven great ancient clans because such ability wasn’t something that anyone could possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll send someone to tell both of you what you should do when the second round of the test begins.” Zuoqiu Ke waved her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu immediately rose up and bid their farewells before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Miss, our forces are sufficient to kick Chen Xi out of test during the second round. Why did you still enlist the help of these two fellows?” After Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu left, a composed and capable young man appeared within the hall and asked with a frown on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The rich do not put themselves in harm’s way. Since we’re able to rely on the might of others to deal with an enemy, then why should we make our own do it?” Zuoqiu Ke spoke indifferently. “Not to mention that I’ve already investigated it. There’s enmity between Yin Miaomiao and Chen Xi in the past, so it couldn’t be any better to make her deal with Chen Xi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she spoke up to here, her pretty face was suffused with a wisp of a piercingly cold expression. “Even if they fail in the end, it wouldn’t be too late for us to make a move then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as she walked out of Iris Continent’s Martial Soul Hall, the excitement between Yin Miaomiao’s brows vanished instantaneously, and she recovered her cold and aloof appearance once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi has just advanced into the Mysterious Immortal Realm, so it’s indeed possible for him to not be eliminated during the first round of the tests. However, we have to be careful as well and avoid being used by the Zuoqiu Clan.” Yin Miaomiao spoke in a low voice via voice transmission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! I disliked that Zuoqiu Ke since the beginning, so I naturally wouldn’t work for her wholeheartedly.” Jiang Zhuliu grunted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s for the best. Being able to form a relationship with the Zuoqiu Clan this time is extremely beneficial towards our cultivation in Dao Emperor Academy in the future as well. I heard that many great figures of the Zuoqiu Clan are teaching in Dao Emperor Academy.” Yin Miaomiao’s gaze was deep as she spoke in a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So in this way, don’t we have to thank Chen Xi for providing such a superb opportunity to us?” Jiang Zhuliu mocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao couldn’t help but smile when she heard this, and then she muttered. “Actually, I’m curious exactly how Chen Xi offended the Zuoqiu Clan that they actually intend to rely on us to deal with him… This is really too strange.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu said indifferently instead, “That kid has always been an ignorant and wildly arrogant fellow. Since when he was in Southbridge Continent, he constantly offended you. He’s a pure troublemaker. So it isn’t anything surprising that he offended the Zuoqiu Clan now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao chuckled lightly before she puckered her lips and didn’t speak any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a Violet Ribbon Starcrest. You have to take good care of it because you won’t just be using it during Dao Emperor Academy’s test. This Violet Ribbon Starcrest will be your identity token once you become a student of Dao Emperor Academy, and it’s related to your cultivation in the future.” Within the hall, Tie Qiuyu called Chen Xi over before passing over a bright violet colored crest that was three fingers wide, the size of an infant’s fist, and completely smooth and translucent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, quickly refine it with your Immortal Force. It’s impossible for you to get another if someone seized it from you.” Tie Qiuyu instructed with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi received it carefully before mobilizing a wisp of Immortal Force, and then the Violet Ribbon Starcrest instantly merged into his palm like water and vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, a wisp of shimmering violet color appeared on his left shoulder. Surprisingly, the Violet Ribbon Starcrest had appeared there. Moreover, at this instant, Chen Xi clearly sensed rows of words floating up into appearance on the Violet Ribbon Starcrest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Name: Chen Xi.</span></p>
