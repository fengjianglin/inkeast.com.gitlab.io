 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The might of Ao Tianxing’s strike increased as he utilized the Laws of a Golden Immortal. It was a Tempest Divine Crest condensed from the Grand Dao Laws of wind and lightning, causing wind and lighting to rumble in a peerlessly violent manner along with his palm strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Chen Xi had truly fought a Golden Immortal, and it was the first time he’d felt the might of an Allheaven Divine Crest. At this instant, a strand of the aura of danger arose in his heart as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Allheaven Divine Crest was too terrifying. It had completely fused two Grand Dao Laws into one, and it was powerful, thick, and filled with an all-powerful aura. It revealed the might to annihilate an army and crush the world, and it had already exceeded the scope of Grand Dao Laws!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Allheaven Divine Crest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nearby students were surprised and bewildered when they saw this. They hadn’t expected that Ao Tianxing who was at the Golden Immortal Realm would actually utilize such a force when dealing with Chen Xi, who was at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Obviously, he was using his cultivation to bully Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this extremely dangerous moment, Chen Xi’s expressions became even calmer and more indifferent instead. His eyes surged with the flames of battle while his mind was calm like snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a single command in his heart, the sword qi that had condensed into clouds swished, and it transformed once more. It transformed into a boundless ocean of sword qi that covered the heavens and the earth as it swept over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the peak strike of the Sword of Water!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ao Tianxing’s palm collided with Chen Xi’s sword qi, and it erupted with a myriad of strands of blazing brilliance. Sword qi swept towards the surroundings while strong winds from his palm whistled and rumbled through the surroundings. It terrified many students to the point of retreating endlessly in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the dust and smoke that suffused the surroundings, Chen Xi’s tall figure retreated seven steps successively. His countenance was slightly pale while his aura had become slightly chaotic. Moreover, the vital blood in his entire body was roiling without end, causing it to feel rather horrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides that, every single step he took caused the ground to crack open and shatter into pieces. When he took his seventh step back, there were already seven enormous holes that had cracked open on the extremely hard ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This obviously showed how terrifying the force contained within Ao Tianxing’s attack was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even then, this strike had still been resisted by Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the nearby crowd saw this scene, they were extremely moved, and a wisp of shock couldn’t help but spread throughout their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had expected that Chen Xi, who was only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, would actually be able to resist the might attack of a Golden Immortal that contained an Allheaven Divine Crest!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was simply like watching a mantis stop a wagon. It was too inconceivable, and they didn’t dare believe their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Golden Immortal Realm and Mysterious Immortal Realm were two entirely different realms of cultivation, and it was like the difference between the heavens and the earth. They weren’t on the same level at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was even to the extent that Chen Xi was merely at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, yet he’d forcefully resisted this strike! Even though he’d fallen into a disadvantageous position, but he’d resisted it in the end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How many people amongst the new students present here were capable of accomplishing this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I never expected that his strength would increase greatly in such a short period of time…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhen Lu looked silently at Chen Xi with a tranquil and composed expression, yet a trace of fluctuation arose in his heart, and he was slightly surprised by Chen Xi’s strength’s speed of improvement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He possesses such combat strength at merely the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, no wonder he was able to obtain the position of first in the final test…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Xuanbing praised lightly while his eyes flowed with divine light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow is a formidable rival. Unfortunately, he’s only at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, and I’ll probably be unable to fight him during the inner court exam two years from now…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Mengli’s clear eyes flowed with a wisp of strange ripples as she looked at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuanyuan Yun, Mu Yuchong, Moqi Yan, Zhongli Xun, and the others had rather complicated feelings. They hadn’t fought Chen Xi during the test, so they didn’t have any understanding of his combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Chen Xi took Ao Tianxing’s attack head-on, they noticed to their shock that Chen Xi’s combat strength was so formidable that it gave them heavy pressure. At the very least, they felt that if they were in Chen Xi’s place, then it would be very difficult for them to resist Ao Tianxing’s attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the expressions of Zuoqiu Yin, Jiang Canghai, and the others sank, and they were surprised and bewildered. Their hearts were filled with hostility towards Chen Xi, so they were naturally unwilling to see Chen Xi put on such a formidable display.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In short, the new students were shocked by Chen Xi’s combat strength, whereas those senior students were shocked and surprised by Chen Xi’s combat strength as well. Only Ao Tianxing’s expression had become slightly unsightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Golden Immortal that had taken the initiative to attack and had even utilized the might of his Allheaven Divine Crest under the gazes of everyone present, being unable to defeat a fellow at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm was simply a humiliation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! I only utilized forty percent of my strength earlier. Come, let me see if you can resist another strike of mine!” Ruthlessness flashed on Ao Tianxing’s face, and he intended to attack once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a wave of shouts resounded at the same time. “Stop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Accompanying these voices was Xuanyuan Yun, Mu Yuchong, Mu Xiaoliu, Liang Ren, Gu Yueming, and the others. All of them had charged out of the crowd and stood before Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was slightly stunned as well. He swept his gaze past Xuanyuan Yun and the others, and as he saw the common hatred in their eyes, his heart was slightly warmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he felt even more hatred towards Ao Wuming, Ao Tianxing, and the others, and he said in his heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When I advance into the Golden Immortal Realm in the future, I’ll definitely pull out a few dragon tendons to repay all of you!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! What? It’s only a spar, could it be that all of you think I’d really cripple him?” Ao Tianxing grunted coldly, yet he didn’t continue with his attack because he understood that he’d already lost the best opportunity to repress Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A spar? Did Chen Xi agree to spar with you? As a Golden Immortal, you suddenly launched an attack against a student at the Mysterious Immortal Realm and even utilized your Allheaven Divine Crest. You obviously intend to disregard your honor, right? Are all the members of your Dragon Dimension shameless like you?” Mu Xiaoliu was the youngest and most aggressive amongst them. He immediately pointed at Ao Tianxing and cursed, and this obviously showed that he deserved his name as a little devil in human shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! A little fellow at the perfection-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm dares to be disrespectful to me?” Ao Tianxing’s face turned cold. With a point of his finger, a violent force flashed out from its tip and shot towards Mu Xiaoliu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” A wisp of rage flashed in Mu Yuchong’s eyes when he saw Ao Tianxing attack Mu Xiaoliu, and he hurriedly blocked before Mu Xiaoliu while his powerful Immortal Force transformed into a thick shield of light before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The force of that point blasted onto the shield and instantly destroyed it. Mu Yuchong let out a muffled groan and staggered back from the force. His countenance turned ghastly pale while a strand of blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re going too far!” Xuanyuan Yun and the others were instantly furious when they saw this, and it was even to the extent that the nearby new students couldn’t bear the sight of this scene and denounced Ao Tianxing as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, the entire surroundings were filled with voices that denounced Ao Tianxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up! The new students this year are really young and arrogant. Since all of you aren’t aware of the rules, then I’ll allow all of you to understand that respecting your seniors is the first lesson all of you must learn in Dao Emperor Academy!” Ao Tianxing sneered when he saw this, and he was utterly unafraid as he suddenly flicked his sleeve, causing the Immortal Force in his body to rumble while his imposing aura grew even more formidable and overbearing. “Step forward if you refuse to accept this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expressions of the new students became extraordinarily unsightly when they saw Ao Tianxing act so arrogant and overbearingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of them who were able to enter Dao Emperor Academy were proud and arrogant, and every single one of them were genius disciples from top powers that possessed deep resources and reserves! So, how could they not be infuriated when being cursed at and disparaged like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” At this moment, even Ji Xuanbing, Zhao Mengli, and the others grunted coldly and walked forward in succession. Ao Tianxing’s words were directed at all of them new students, so how could they continue watching coldly from the sidelines?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said that Ao Tianxing’s words had incurred the wrath of them all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, even the senior students felt that Ao Tianxing had overdone it, and they frowned without end because today was the first day that the new students had arrived at the academy. If he were to cause a great disturbance, then the consequences would absolutely be severe to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ao Tianxing frowned when he saw this scene, and his gaze was slightly gloomy. Obviously, he realized that the situation was slightly bad as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Ao Tianxing wasn’t willing to show weakness, and he shook his head and said coldly, “All the new students now are really lacking in backbone now. They only know how to join forces. How disappointing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha! Lacking in backbone? A Golden Immortal like you hasn’t passed through the inner court’s exam until now, yet only knows how to come and bully new students. You call that ability?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! Even though I’m a new student, but it’s only because I’ve cultivated for slightly fewer years than all of you. What’s there for you to be arrogant about? Do you really think we’d be afraid of you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The members of the Dragon Dimension really are those that bully the weak and fear the strong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they noticed that Ao Tianxing intended to leave, the new students ridiculed him in succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did all of you say?” Ao Tianxing suddenly stopped, and his gaze was icy cold while battle intent surged in his body. “Today is the first for all of you new students in the academy, and I originally didn’t intend to make it difficult for all of you, but all of you actually dared to provoke me repeatedly. If this can be called tolerable, then what is intolerable?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mighty aura of a Golden Immortal suddenly swept out from Ao Tianxing towards the surroundings, and it suppressed the clamorous noise from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The new students felt even more infuriated when they saw this. Normally, all of them who were disciples of top powers had a pride of their own, so they didn’t have deep relationships and could only be considered to be acquaintances. However, the overbearing attitude of Ao Tianxing caused all of them to be bound by common hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Ao Wuming and the other disciples of the Dragon Dimension maintained silence as they watched the situation coldly from the sidelines, and even Zuoqiu Yin, Jiang Canghai, and the others acted in this way as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An inkling could be noticed from this. Those that had hatred towards Chen Xi naturally looked forward towards Ao Tianxing to teach Chen Xi a terrible lesson, whereas those that had no enmity with Chen Xi had stepped forward instead and formed a front with Chen Xi because they were new students as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was slightly surprised when he saw this, and he said in his heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ao Wuming probably never imagined that dealing with me would cause the situation to develop to such an extent, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s having a dispute here? Could it be that all of you aren’t aware that fighting amongst each other violates the rules of the academy?” Right at this moment, a low voice resounded, and then a group of people appeared out of this air. They’d actually utilized teleportation, and it was obviously an existence at the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue clothed young man in the lead had fair skin, deep eye sockets, a hawk nose, thin lips, and revealed a gloomy and cold aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The students of the outer court’s Enforcement Hall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The one in the lead is the second on the Allheaven Golden Rankings, Zuoqiu Jun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw this group of people, the group of senior students that were watching from the surroundings became restless.</span></p>
