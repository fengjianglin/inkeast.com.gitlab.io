 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scripture Pavilion was extremely silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single student was silently comprehending different books, and Chen Xi was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, he was stuck at the end of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, and he was only lacking a final piece of comprehension before he would be able to find a path that led to the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, breaking through carried risks as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially when one charged into the Golden Immortal Realm. Once the path one chose was flawed, then one would suffer a tribulation, and even if one was able to survive it, it would be impossible for one to continue on the path to immortality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So even if it was the disciples of great powers that were conceited and proud to the extreme, they became extremely cautious when dealing with this barrier, and they didn’t dare be careless at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi naturally wouldn’t be careless at all either. But he would also not restrain his Dao Heart because of being excessively worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he actually didn’t have any time to consider the matter of breaking through at all because his entire mind and heart were already drawn by the profundities within the Allheaven Quintessence Examination, and he was immersed within it and unable to free himself from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was written personally by Fuxi himself, and it was the simplest perception of the Golden Immortal Realm. There were no techniques to break through written within it, yet it allowed one to comprehend the most essential knowledge of the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The profundities within it couldn’t be considered to be difficult to understand or obscure, yet it was boundlessly broad and profound. It was absolutely not something that could be fully comprehended overnight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this moment, Chen Xi was completely unaware of the passage of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An entire month later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some students had left while others had come to the third floor of this Scripture Pavilion, and only Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the spot without moving at all. He was like a clay statue that was completely silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he comprehending the Dao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps he is, or perhaps he isn’t.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I think he might be accepting assignments in the assignment area of the Violet Ribbon Starcrest? He completed many assignments in the Dao of Talismans lately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Strange, he’s completing assignments in the Scripture Pavilion? Chen Xi really doesn’t do things like a normal person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps the pressure on him is too great, and he wants to participate in the inner court exam that’s about to start yet isn’t willing to miss the opportunity to earn Starpoints. So he can only do this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alas, if Chen Xi was a disciple from a top power, then he would have probably far surpassed Zhen Lu, Zhao Mengli, and the others a long time ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, those disciples of top powers don’t have to worry about earning Starpoints, and they can just concentrate on charging into the Golden Immortal Realm. How can Chen Xi compare with them like this? Right, I heard that Ji Xuanbing and Zhao Mengli have headed to the Allheaven Golden Rankings to test their strengths, and they’ve both ascended into the top fifty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I heard of it as well. Zhongli Xun, Jiang Canghai, Ao Wuming, and the others are tempering themselves at the Illusory Heaven Immortal Domain as well, and they’ll probably test themselves at the Allheaven Golden Rankings as soon as they’re done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Less than a year remains before the inner court exam will begin yet Chen Xi is still unable to step into the Golden Immortal Realm. How worrisome!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One year ago, he was still only at the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, yet he intends to charge into the Golden Immortal Realm one year later. Even I feel that he practically has no hope.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In short, we can only wait and see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So long as they discerned Chen Xi’s identity, then everyone within the pavilion would discuss him, and the content of their discussions was mostly related to the inner court exam that would be held soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, along with the approach of the inner court exam that was held once every ten years, the atmosphere in the outer court had become even more tense. There were students heading to Dao Seek Mountain at practically every single moment in order to observe the change in ranking on the Allheaven Golden Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also many students that sped up their cultivation and tempered their strengths madly. They either exchanged their Starpoints for some treasured or some medicinal pills that were beneficial towards improving their combat strength… They could be said to have used every means available to them as they prepared to participate in the inner court exam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the only target they had to achieve to participate in the inner court exam was to be ranked in the top fifty of the Allheaven Golden Rankings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, up until now, Chen Xi’s name hadn’t appeared on the Allheaven Golden Rankings, let alone become ranked in the top fifty. The reason was naturally very simple: he still hadn’t been able to break through into the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This drew the attention of many students from the outer court. Some were worried, some remained indifferent, and some were certain that Chen Xi was bound to be unable to participate in the inner court exam this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he was only at the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm one year ago, so he practically had no hope of advancing into the Golden Immortal Realm before the inner court exam.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second month after he entered the third floor of the Scripture Pavilion, Chen Xi who was like a statue had finally opened his eyes. His eyes seemed to vast and profound while he stared blankly, and he seemed to be in a state of comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he put down the Allheaven Quintessence Examination, and he searched for the book, Profound Views on Breakthrough, written by Yun Fusheng and Tracing Back the Dao to Allheaven that the Dean had left behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the third month, Chen Xi had finished comprehending these two books. He contemplated in concentration for an entire three days and night before he stood up and started reading the other books on the third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Supreme Dao Seek Notes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seven Reflections of Truth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Divine Heaven Illustrated Book.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reading this time was unlike the comprehension from before. Chen Xi’s speed had obviously increased, and it was even to the extent that it had attained a shocking state. He practically finished a book every fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene caused many students to be surprised and even shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was common knowledge that all these books that could be gathered within the Scripture Pavilion were precious in the world, and they contained boundless profundities. Ordinary students required at least three months or even three to five years to completely comprehend a single book.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if it was a peerless figure with extraordinary comprehension ability, it was impossible for that person to completely comprehend a book every fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So Chen Xi’s display at this moment was extremely conspicuous and puzzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow Chen Xi wouldn’t have been overcome by his inner demons, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alas, he’s probably determined to participate in the inner court exam, yet he has been unable to break through for so long. Perhaps it has caused his Dao Heart to lose balance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If this continues, then it’ll be extremely harmful to his cultivation. Should we go advise him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, you? He’s the first amongst the new students and unparalleled at the Mysterious Immortal Realm. What qualifications do you have to advise him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi remained indifferent towards all these discussions and he continued reading the numerous books that were written by the great figures of the past at a constant speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These sort of actions continued until the fourth month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this day, even the black clothed old man that looked after the Scripture Pavilion was alarmed, and he arrived hastily to the third floor. His brows couldn’t help but knit extremely tightly together when he saw Chen Xi who was swiftly flipping through the books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His heart and mind are listless while his vital energy is flowing indeterminately. Is he comprehending the Dao? Or has he been overcome by his inner demons?” As an instructor of the Scripture Reserve, he’d seen many students comprehend the Dao while looking after the Scripture Pavilion, yet he’d never seen someone in a state like Chen Xi’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if Chen Xi was said to have been overcome by his inner demons, it just happened to not conform to the symptoms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused his brows to knit together even more tightly. In the end, out of consideration for the safety of Chen Xi, he decided to wake Chen Xi up and ask Chen Xi exactly what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right when he was about to approach Chen Xi, he was suddenly stopped by the Book Demon, Benji. “Could it be that you’ve forgotten Yun Fusheng from all those years ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only a single sentence, yet it caused the old man to stop abruptly while revealing a shocked expression, and then the scene of Yun Fusheng reading books all those years ago flashed into his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just as Chen Xi was. The books flashed by, yet he wasn’t in a state of Dao comprehension nor had he been overwhelmed by his inner demons, and he was truly comprehending and understanding the profundities of the books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their ability of understanding and deduction had obviously attained an unbelievable and astonishing level, thus the state they were in seemed to be completely different from the other students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yun Fusheng? If another Yun Fusheng can appear in the academy, then the Zuoqiu Clan will definitely be unable to eat and sleep in peace…” The old man seemed to have thought of something, causing a wisp of sorrow to appear on his face before he shook his head in the end, and then he turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What sort of ability of discernment is that? It’s definitely impossible for Chen Xi to be a second Yun Fusheng because even Yun Fusheng wasn’t so…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Benji sighed in his heart and stared at Chen Xi for a long time before he vanished into thin air in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the fifth month since he entered the Scripture Pavilion, Chen Xi finally stopped what he was doing, and then stood on the spot as he pondered deeply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This caused all the students that were paying attention to Chen Xi’s actions to be unable to help but heave a sigh of relief. It seemed as if they wouldn’t be able to endure it if Chen Xi continued on like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people included Xuanyuan Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He frequently came over to the Scripture Pavilion in the past five months. On one hand it was to comprehend the content of the books, and on the other hand, he was frequently paying attention to the state Chen Xi was in so as to avoid any mishaps from occurring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason he did this was obviously because of A’xiu’s instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi, where’re you going?” When he noticed that Chen Xi actually intended to leave the Scripture Pavilion, Xuanyuan Yun instantly recovered from his shock and hurriedly went over to ask Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dao Development Reserve’s Illusory Heaven Immortal Domain.” Chen Xi’s expression was calm while the space between his brows carried a slightly dazed expression as he seemed to have still not fully woken up from that strange state of comprehension he was in before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve already found the path to break through?” Xuanyuan Yun was shocked in his heart when he heard this, and he looked at Chen Xi with surprise and admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as these words were spoken, it drew the attention of the nearby students as well, and all of them were extremely shocked as they successively shot their gazes towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi didn’t notice all of this and nodded casually before he turned and left. At this moment, various comprehensions were surging in his heart, and only by seizing this opportunity to verify them at the Illusory Heaven Immortal Domain would he be able to grasp them completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, it would be the moment he broke through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw Chen Xi nod, everyone including Xuanyuan Yun was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He comprehended the path to break through into the Golden Immortal Realm after staying in the Scripture Pavilion for five months?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was simply something they didn’t dare imagine. After all, advancing into the Golden Immortal Realm was truly too difficult, and everyone relied on their fortune and comprehension ability. Moreover, no matter how extraordinary one’s natural talent was, if one didn’t obtain possess this fortune and comprehension ability, then it would be utterly impossible for one to touch the threshold towards the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Chen Xi had used less than half a year to find his path to the Golden Immortal Realm. If news of this were to be spread, then it would definitely cause a mighty uproar in the academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait, I’ll go with you.” Xuanyuan Yun hurriedly followed up when he saw Chen Xi’s figure vanish from the third floor. He wasn’t willing to miss the moment Chen Xi advanced into the Golden Immortal Realm because it would be greatly beneficial to his own advancement if he was able to observe Chen Xi’s advancement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention that he’d wanted to experience the Illusory Heaven Immortal Domain a long time ago.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
