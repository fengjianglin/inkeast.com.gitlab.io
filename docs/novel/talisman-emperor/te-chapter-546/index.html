 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi had started smiling instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian wished for nothing more than to smash his fist into the bastard’s face when he saw Chen Xi’s smile, but he forcefully restrained himself. There was nothing he could do about it because even if he held the decree of the Immortal Dimension now, it would be impossible for him to continue deterring everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because any one of the great figures like Madman Liu, Heaven Trampler, Huang Meiweng, Six Senses, and Fan Zhanmei by Chen Xi’s side were capable of easily annihilating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances, how could he dare act rashly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he felt fortunate that Qing Xiuyi had still fallen into his hands at the end, so his trip wasn’t fruitless. As for Chen Xi, there was always opportunities to kill him in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the next scene that occurred caught him off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing stood by Heaven Trampler’s side as she said with a light voice, “Senior Brother, that Heavenly Immortal seized away a companion of ours. I hope you can uphold justice for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Senior, help this companion of mine.” Huangfu Qingying and the others spoke to Huang Meiweng, Six Senses, and Fang Zhanmei that were at their sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the gazes of all the great figures descended onto Bing Shitian in unison, and their gazes either contained indifference, ferocious coldness, or a lack of emotion… But their gazes caused Bing Shitian to feel unprecedented pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of pressure caused him to feel his breathing become difficult, and his expression became unsightly to the extreme. Never had he imagined that these little fellows that were like ants would actually dare strike back at this moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little fellow, quickly hand her over!” Heaven Trampler spoke with a booming voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re a Heavenly Immortal’s External Avatar, yet you actually carried out such a deed that’s beneath your dignity. Truly disappointing.” Huang Meiweng still had a sullen expression as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Karma goes around in circles, and retribution is never pleasant. Benefactor, listen to this little monk and quickly let that little girl go.” Six Senses shook his head as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let her go!” Fang Zhanmei was the most direct, and he directly spat out three words with a voice that carried the densest aura of slaughter, and it seemed as if he intended to kill Bing Shitian if he disobeyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw these four great figures successively directing the tips of their spears at Bing Shitian, the pressure from this even caused the nearby experts of the various Dynasties and the emissaries of the Dark Reverie to be terrified to the point of almost suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the strength of the pressure that the concerned party, Bing Shitian, faced was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression was gloomy, his teeth gritted tightly, and the rage and aggrieved feelings in his heart burned like flames that scorched and caused piercing pain to him. He truly regretted being unable to annihilate Chen Xi earlier, because if he’d done this earlier, then so many unexpected changes in the situation wouldn’t have occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, he knew that everything was too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was absolutely impossible to make him hand over Qing Xiuyi just like this. She was the only woman he truly loved since he was young, and it was with great difficulty that he was finally reunited with her. So how could he be willing to let go so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if he didn’t let go, then how would he face these abnormally formidable fellows? At this moment, Bing Shitian was struggling intensely in his heart, and his expression changed indeterminately because he actually didn’t know what to do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There would absolutely be no one that would believe that a Heavenly Immortal that held the decree of the Immortal Dimension could be pressured to such an extremely hard pressed extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it had really occurred now, and the visual impact created from this caused everyone in the surroundings to even start to feel slight pity for Bing Shitian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If only you knew that this would happen, then perhaps you wouldn’t have acted in this way?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, there’d been some people that felt dissatisfied with Bing Shitian instructing the emissaries of the Dark Reverie to suppress Chen Xi and the others since the beginning. After all, Chen Xi had saved everyone yesterday, and Bing Shitian’s actions of not trying to repay Chen Xi but punish Chen Xi and the others instead was something that many people couldn’t bear the sight of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now when they saw Bing Shitian fall to such a situation, many people were extremely delighted in their hearts, but they just didn’t reveal it on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, they weren’t Chen Xi, and Bing Shitian was still an unshakeable mountain to them. So they could only revere him and not dare be disrespectful in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoists, please allow me to say something.” Right at this moment, Yun Lansheng suddenly took a step forward and took a deep breath before he said, “This young woman is a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal, and she was the Senior Sister of me and Senior Brother Bing in her previous lifetime. We’re bringing her with us this time because it’s the order of the Sect Master and various elders of my Heavenflow Dao Sect, and we absolutely wouldn’t dare to harm her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heaven Trampler and the others were slightly shocked when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, Miss Qing’s identity in her previous lifetime was indeed that of a Heavenflow Dao Sect disciple, but she’d already indicated earlier that she would absolutely not leave with all of you. However, you used forceful methods on her with the intention of taking her with you. How do you explain this?” Chen Xi spoke with a clear voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s how it is.” Heaven Trampler and the others finally came to an understanding, and they successively shot hostile gazes at Bing Shitian and Yun Lansheng once again because forcing others against their will was a bit too despicable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Lansheng laughed bitterly and hurriedly explained. “Fellow Daoists, there’s something all of you are unaware of. This Senior Sister Qing of mine has experienced a hundred reincarnations and a myriad of difficulties. If she doesn’t return to the Heavenflow Dao Sect, then her path towards the Grand Dao in this lifetime would probably be destroyed overnight and be a step short of completion. So we had no choice but to carry out this terrible move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reincarnation of a hundred lifetimes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of cold light flashed past the eyes of Heaven Trampler and the others when they heart these words, and they said, “This woman wouldn’t be Qing Xiuyi, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart jerked. Never had he imagined that with the status of Heaven Trampler and the others, they would actually know of Qing Xiuyi’s existence! This caused him to simply not dare imagine exactly what sort of height Qing Xiuyi had attained in her previous lifetime.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did she receive the attention of so many people?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She’s precisely my Senior Sister.” Yun Lansheng heaved a sigh of relief. He saw a trace of hope to change the situation from the reactions of Heaven Trampler and the others, and he hurriedly struck while the iron was still hot. “Fellow Daoists, I presume all of you know clearly how great the risk she took to experience a hundred reincarnations, and it could be said to have a very slim chance of survival. Moreover, Senior Sister Qing left behind all her past karma in the Heavenflow Dao Sect, so if she’s unable to reclaim and destroy this past karma, then her entire life would be bound to be destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These words are reasonable. As a cultivator, which one of us doesn’t carry a body full of past karma on their way to ascend into the heavens? If one doesn’t possess it, then one is unable to seek the Dao, and if one doesn’t abandon it, it’s impossible to become an immortal.” Huang Meiweng sighed emotionally with a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so in this way, this Qing Xiuyi really has to be taken back by all of you,” said Heaven Trampler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. Don’t worry, Fellow Daoist. A figure like Senior Sister Qing is extremely important to my Heavenflow Dao Sect, and we absolutely wouldn’t dare treat her shabbily,” said Yun Lansheng.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing puckered her lips yet her gaze looked at Chen Xi instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, it wasn’t just Heaven Trampler, even the nearby Huang Meiweng, Six Senses, and Fang Zhanmei noticed that Chen Xi seemed to be the leading figure amongst these juniors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This discovery caused them to feel slightly surprised. After all, they knew how extraordinary the disciples they chose were, yet now all of them were obediently listening to a single person. How could they not be curious about this discovery?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh!” Their gazes briefly sized Chen Xi up and seemed to have noticed something, causing a wisp of shock to be flash on their faces, and then they quickly recovered their calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, great waves had arisen within their hearts.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His fate is concealed by the workings of the heavens? Exactly what great figure is actually capable of utilizing the workings of the heavens and completely concealing the fate of this kid?</span></p>

Once one arrived at their level, it was fine just knowing something, yet once one inquired about it, one might be tainted by some sort of karma, and it was difficult to guess if it would turn out to be fortune or calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t notice all this as his heart was thrown into chaos by what Yun Lansheng had said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did he understand that it seemed that no matter what happened, Qing Xiuyi had to return to the Heavenflow Dao Sect. Otherwise, everything she did during these hundred reincarnations would come to naught.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something he was absolutely unwilling to see happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he glanced at the distant Bing Shitian, he was extremely unwilling in his heart to allow Qing Xiuyi to return to the Heavenflow Dao Sect just like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What should I do?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere seemed to be silent, perfectly silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It felt as if Chen Xi ruled over everything present here, and a single decision of his would cause everything to undergo different changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was merely a feeling. After all is said and done, Chen Xi was still relying on the might of Heaven Trampler and the others to attain such an effect, and it wasn’t the materialization of his own strength and will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Chen Xi raised his head slowly, and he stared at Bing Shitian with a calm gaze as he said, “Alright, I’ll allow you to take her with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A single sentence, a few words, yet they seemed extremely heavy. At the instant he spoke these words, it caused Chen Xi to feel as if all the strength in his entire body was completely sucked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did indeed care extremely about Qing Xiuyi and wished for nothing more than to seize her back from Yun Lansheng’s hands right now. But for the sake of her future, her path to the Grand Dao, and her everything, Chen Xi could only do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t feel that he was very noble, and he only firmly and wholeheartedly felt that only by making this decision would he never feel regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Lansheng and Bing Shitian heaved a sigh of relief… At this moment, everyone present heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts, and it seemed as if this answer of Chen Xi’s was similarly what they were willing to see in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Zhen Liuqing and the others understood exactly how much unwillingness and pain Chen Xi felt in his heart when making this decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, since you’ve made this decision, then I’m not afraid to tell you that the entire Heavenflow Dao Sect will hold a ceremony for me and Senior Sister Qing a hundred years from now, and we’ll officially be made Dao Companions.” Bing Shitian spoke out abruptly as he stared at Chen Xi with a calm gaze, and he said slowly, “This agreement was already set by the seniors of the sect a long time ago before Senior Sister Qing reincarnated herself, and it would be held once Senior Sister Qing completed her hundred reincarnations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words seemed to be so sudden, like a thunderclap that suddenly resounded beneath a clear and cloudless sky, and it caused everyone to be astounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi’s entire body was shocked stiff by these words since a long time ago, and a tempestuous storm had arisen in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred years from now, a ceremony would be held, and she will become Dao Companions with Bing Shitian!?</span></p>
