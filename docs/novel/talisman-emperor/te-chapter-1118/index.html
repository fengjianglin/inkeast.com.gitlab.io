 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

I heard that the experts that came from the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, Phoenix Clan, and various others place are the top figures in their dimensions. If they were to participate in the test, then they would definitely replace many positions that belonged to our Immortal Dimension.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi sighed with emotion and said, “This also proves that the resources and reserves of Dao Emperor Academy are formidable indeed. Otherwise, how could it draw so many forces over to participate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren glanced at Chen Xi and said abruptly, “You don’t seem to be worried at all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi shrugged. “What’s the point in being worried?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu chuckled as he scolded. “You little fellow, you really know how to act! You were already ranked at the 999</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings while at the perfection-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm. Now that you’ve advanced into the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, even if someone’s position was to be seized away, it wouldn’t be you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren came to a sudden realization as well, and he smiled as he pointed at Chen Xi and said, “You really keep too low of a profile. You made me get worried for nothing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, Liang Ren’s brows knit together as he said, “However, Yin Miaomiao advanced successfully once more a month ago, and she entered into the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Originally, she was already ranked at the 546</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings, and after she advanced in her cultivation this time, her rankings would probably be even higher.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi understood what Liang Ren meant, and he laughed in a relaxed manner. “Even you think I’m unworthy of challenging her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren knew that Chen Xi was joking, and he couldn’t help but shake his head, but he still said in a serious manner, “I’m not saying that you’re unworthy of challenging her. I’m just worried that you’ll be preoccupied by this matter, and it’ll affect your performance during the recruitment test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded and said, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Tie Qiuyu said with a serious tone as well, “Don’t be careless. That was only the first round, and there are two more tests after that. They’re respectively a test of live combat and Martial Dao Will. The live combat battles in the second round are especially brutal, and when this round of the test ends, three hundred people will be eliminated!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s brows raised as he said, “Will it be arena battles?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu shook his head and spoke with profound meaning in his words. “No, it’s a true battle. Sneak attacks, assassination, poison, ganging up… One can use every trick up one’s sleeve. You have to understand that there are no rules during a real battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He paused for a moment and continued. “This second round of the test is also called the Ironblood Hunt!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi pondered silently for a moment before he asked. “Then is there anything to pay attention to in the third test?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu’s expression eased up greatly as he said casually, “The third round is a test of Martial Dao Will, and it can’t be said to be dangerous. Another two hundred people will be eliminated during this round. But you don’t have to worry because I’ve tested your Martial Dao Will in the past, and it’s comparable to the six blazing suns. You’ll absolutely be able to smoothly pass through this round.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Comparable to the six blazing suns?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren was stunned. He glanced at Chen Xi with surprise, and he seemed as if he was looking at a freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi didn’t notice Liang Ren’s reaction, and he just frowned as he said, “Martial Dao Will?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’d once witnessed the will of a Heavenly Immortal in a Heavenly Immortal’s Decree, and he’d witnessed the Golden Immortal’s will possessed by Bing Shitian’s clone. Both of them were extremely formidable, yet up until now, he hadn’t figured out exactly where these wills came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu seemed to have seen through Chen Xi’s bewilderment, and he shook his head and said, “No one knows exactly what Martial Dao Will is. But the Immortal Dimension publicly acknowledges that the Martial Dao Will is the overall representation of one’s cultivation of the Dao Heart, the imposing aura of one’s strength, the potential one possesses, and the strength of one’s soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The height of one’s Martial Dao Will proved how formidable the potential, cultivation of &nbsp;the Dao Heart, and strength of the soul possessed by an immortal was. All in all, the third round of the test is a test that’s directed towards the various strengths possessed by an immortal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded and felt much more at ease. If it was like this, then the Martial Dao Will he possessed would definitely not lose to the other experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All in all, the most important is the second round of the test. This round of the test is extremely brutal, and many dazzling geniuses of the Immortal Dimension would mostly fall during this round of the test.” Tie Qiuyu sighed with emotion, and he seemed to have recalled many incidents of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, Tie Qiuyu’s expression became solemn to the extreme. He looked at Chen Xi and Liang Ren in a serious manner before he said, “You five little fellows will be representing the Southbridge Continent this time. I’m clearly aware that there’s a great deal of enmity between all of you, but please promise me that even if all of you can’t cooperate sincerely during the second round of the test, don’t make a move against each other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After all, all of you represent Southbridge Continent and not just yourselves…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi listened silently before he said, “Don’t worry senior. So long as they don’t offend me, then I’ll naturally not make a move against them during the test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren nodded as well and said, “Chen Xi is right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu seemed to heave a sigh of relief when he saw both of them agree, and he said with a smile, “That’s for the best. Sometimes, no matter how fierce internal strife is, we can’t allow outsiders to laugh at us. Once all of you have grown up and possess the qualifications to participate in the vast campaign of the Immortal Dimension against its enemies from the outside, all of you will notice that the enmity of the past is so insignificant before the common enemy of the three dimensions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, Tie Qiuyu had stood up, and then he turned around and walked towards the depths of the hall. “I’m going to instruct the others. Seize this opportunity to get to know each other better. Seven days from now, I’ll lead all of you to the inner city of Darkombat City and officially participate in the recruitment tests of Dao Emperor Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice hadn’t finished resounding in the air, yet his figure had already vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but recall the xeno-race and the Cosmos Beasts he saw in the Talisman Dimension, and he couldn’t help but be dazed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three dimensions are already so vast, so what sort of domain do its enemies reside in?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren withdrew a light green colored piece of silk, and he unfolded it before Chen Xi and said, “Look, Chen Xi. These are the top thousand experts on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings. I copied it from the floating wall of light a few days ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi returned to his senses and raised his eyes to size up this list. At first glance, he noticed that his own ranking was still at the 999</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when his gaze moved down slightly, he instantly noticed that it was actually a woman called Zuoqiu Ke that was at the 1,000</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surnamed Zuoqiu and from Iris Continent. She’s definitely a member of the Zuoqiu Clan…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi noticed this, and then his gaze scanned the entire ranking. He noticed that there were actually more than ten people from the Zuoqiu Clan within the top thousand positions, and this number was slightly shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the top thousand positions of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings didn’t just contain the top experts of the younger generation in the 4,900 continents of the Immortal Dimension, even the peerless figures of the four great continents were listed on the ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, since the disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan were capable of occupying over ten positions on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings, it proved how deep the resources and reserves of the Zuoqiu Clan were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Chen Xi also noticed that besides the Zuoqiu Clan, the Mu Clan and Xuanyuan Clan had each occupied over ten positions on the rankings. This caused Chen Xi to recall A’xiu and Mu Linglong. He was very clearly aware that their clans were probably on par with the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides that, the disciples of the Ji Clan, Jiang Clan, Moqi Clan, and Zhongli Clans were similarly on par with the Zuoqiu, Mu, and Xuanyuan Clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Practically all the experts that were ranked in the top ten of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings were from these clans. For example, the first ranked was Ji Xuanbing, the second ranked was Zhongli Xun, the third ranked was Jiang Canghai…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi even noticed a young man called Zuoqiu Yin, and he was ranked at the seventh position on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ji Clan, Mu Clan, Jiang Clan, Xuanyuan Clan, Moqi Clan, Zhongli Clan, and Zuoqiu Clan. These seven great clans were also called the seven ancient clans. They’re the most ancient and influential clans in the Immortal Dimensions, and no other power could compare to them in terms of their resources, reserves, and age. They’re born nobles, and Immortal King Realm existences had appeared amongst their ancestors.” Liang Ren spoke in a low voice while he couldn’t help but reveal a trace of admiration. “Presently, there are no lack of top powers in the four great continents that can compare with them, but in terms of their resources and reserves, they’re still slightly inferior to these seven ancient clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but be shocked when he heard this. It was the first time that he’d heard all of this. Especially the Zuoqiu Clan was actually amongst these seven ancient clans, and this caused him to feel rather uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So in this way, these seven ancient clans are like the topmost powers in the Immortal Dimension?” asked Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren thought for a moment and shook his head as he said, “Not really. They only represent the most ancient inheritance and reserves. For example, everyone knows the Valiant Star Immortal King’s name, yet he’s surnamed ‘Qin.’ In terms of their forces, the Qin Clan that he’s from isn’t inferior to the seven ancient clans at all, and it’s even to the extent that his Qin Clan is even slightly more formidable than some of these seven ancient clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren paused for a moment and continued. “Besides this, the clans that the Profound Path Immortal King and Icesky Immortal King belong to are similarly capable of matching the seven ancient clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Xi heard Liang Ren only mention the Valiant Star, Profound Path, and Icesky Immortal Kings, he couldn’t help but ask curiously. “What about the Midnight Immortal King?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren said with a smile, “The Midnight Immortal King is the most mysterious. According to rumor, he’s a natural god of the Immortal Dimension that attained the Dao and achieved kingship, so he naturally doesn’t possess a clan or sect. However, don’t think that the Midnight Immortal King can’t compare to the other three Immortal Kings. Amongst the four great Immortal Kings, the Immortal King revered the most by the myriad of living beings in the Immortal Dimension is the Midnight Immortal King. As for the reason, I’m not sure as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. “The more I understand, the more I feel that I’m ignorant. There really are many extraordinary figures hiding in the Immortal Dimension.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren deeply agreed and sighed with emotion. “Yeah, I originally thought that the seven ancient clans and the top powers of the four great continents were the strongest existences in the Immortal Dimension. But later on, I found out that the forces of the Immortal Court are even more formidable, whereas when I thought that the Immortal Court was the one and only ruler of the Immortal Dimension, I noticed that it turned out that there were even more mysterious existences than the Immortal Court…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished speaking, his expression carried a wisp of disappointment, and he sighed endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s heart surged with excitement when he heard this, and he felt extreme yearning. After that, he shook his head and returned to his senses because all of this was a bit too far away from him now, and it was better for him to find a foothold in the Immortal Dimension first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, he had to enter Dao Emperor Academy first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he started cultivating, his greatest taboo was reaching for what was beyond his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw Chen Xi act so calmly, Liang Ren couldn’t restrain himself from asking. “Could it be that you don’t want to know what powers are even more mysterious than the Immortal Court?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi smiled with deep meaning. “I’ve already guessed the answer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren slapped himself on the head and cried out. “How could I be such a fool! Your inheritance comes from…” He’d only spoken halfway before he stopped abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because that name wasn’t just a great taboo to him, it was a great taboo to the various large powers of the Immortal Dimension, and they couldn’t speak of it.</span></p>
