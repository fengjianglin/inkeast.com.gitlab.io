The mountains, ground, and sky… Everything here was completely pitch black.</span></p>

It was entirely deathly silent and suffused with a unique murderous air.</span></p>

His handsome and firm expression was completely pale at this moment and practically translucent, and he sat cross-legged on the ground while panting for breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This figure was precisely Chen Xi, who’d escaped from the Earthly Immortal Realm expert!</span></p>

He seemed entirely like an injured person that was on his deathbed, and even an ordinary wild beast was able to take his life at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I never imagined that the sudden attack of an Earthly Immortal Realm expert is so terrifying. I currently possess six times my combat strength, yet almost lost my life.</span></p>

In the past, he’d seen many Earthly Immortal Realm experts and had even seen existences at the Heavenly Immortal Realm. But it was the first time he’d fought an Earthly Immortal Realm expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of near death experience allowed him to deep understand the gap between the Nether Transformation Realm and Earthly Immortal Realm, and it was simply like the distance between the heavens and the earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for him entering the bronze door and escaping fortunately, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to worry. For the sake of the Chaotic Divine Crystal, I wouldn’t watch idly by as you died,” said the tiny cauldron. It was only around an inch in size and seemed as if it was entirely constructed from jade, and it hung before Chen Xi’s neck while seeming extremely mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then why didn’t you make a move earlier?” Chen Xi laughed bitterly, and he had a rare moment of complaining about the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew you’d be fine. Not to mention fighting an Earthly Immortal Realm expert would allow you to better understand the exact level of your strength. This was a precious piece of experience that an ordinary person would be utterly unable to obtain.” The tiny cauldron said, “Now, you should swiftly repair your body. This place is already the core area of the Divine Palace of Creation, and I’ve sensed many dangerous existences.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt apprehensive in his heart, and he didn’t dare dally to sit down properly before he took a breath and gradually circulated his Blackhole World to start repairing his injuries with all his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t you seize that jade pot? Consume the wine within it and you’ll be able to swiftly repair your body.” The tiny cauldron couldn’t help but guide Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jade pot?” Chen Xi was stunned, and then he came to an understanding, and he immediately withdrew the jade pot he seized from the hall earlier. This jade pot seemed as if it was carved out from jade, it was suffused with the glow of spirit energy and flickered with divine lights, and it emitted strands of sweet fragrance that invaded the bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely this shocking scene allowed one to know clearly that the wine contained within the jade pot was surely extraordinary, and perhaps it was divine wine brewed by immortals left behind by the exalted expert from the primeval times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stretched out his hand to open the pot, and within it was merely a thin layer of wine that was extremely thick. It seemed as if it had experienced the sedimentation of countless years, causing the liquid to be crystalline like amber, and it flowed with a fragrance that intoxicated the soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just a single whiff caused Chen Xi to feel every single inch of his skin, bones, and veins seem to have awakened, start cheering, and jumping with joy. They were filled with yearning, and even his soul was slightly intoxicated, and it felt indescribably wonderful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This isn’t ordinary wine. If I’m not wrong, it was brewed from various spirit medicines, and there’s no lack of divine treasures that could only be found during the primeval times, causing its value to be immeasurable, and it isn’t inferior to the Nine Reincarnations Immortal Pill that’s capable of bringing people back from the dead. So long a single cup is sent into the world, it would be sufficient to be numerous people fight for it with their lives on the line.” The tiny cauldron reminded. “Just a small sip is sufficient, don’t waste it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded and withdrew a jade cup before pouring in a small bit and swallowing it in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A variety of sweet fragrances curled up. As soon as he swallowed it, a refreshing warm flow gushed throughout his entire body like a wyrm that was moving about within his body, causing his face to flush completely red while he felt slightly dizzy and exceedingly intoxicated. As he breathed, rays of pure divine light flickered from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Swiftly seal up the pot, don’t allow the medicinal effect to leak out,” said the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sealed his six senses tightly as he swiftly sobered up, and then he sealed up the jade pot before carefully placing it within the Buddha’s Pagoda along with the jade cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely a precious treasure. If it was a normal person, then merely taking a whiff of its fragrance would probably cause the person to be knocked out and fall into a strange state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was this small sip that Chen Xi had drank, it would surely cause any other cultivator that wasn’t prepared in the slightest to have their &nbsp;body crushed by the tremendous medicinal strength and collapsing to the ground from being drunk, causing the medicinal strength to be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Chen Xi’s body was sufficiently strong, and he possessed the tiny cauldron’s guidance, so he wouldn’t fall to the extent of wasting this medicinal strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, his practically ruined body was enveloped by the miraculous warm flow, and it was healings and recovering at a speed that was practically visible to the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In almost less than 10 minutes of time, every injury in his entire body had been healed! If this scene were to be seen by that Earthly Immortal Realm expert, Chu Jing, that injured him, Chu Jing would surely be left dumbstruck!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, Chen Xi’s body emitted the rumbling of thunder before erupting with a blazing glow that carried an exuberant aura of vitality. His entire body was crystalline, his blood seemed as if it was burning as it surged and boiled, and his body refinement cultivation almost broke through to the Nether Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression instantly turned to shock when he noticed this and swiftly stopped it because this moment wasn’t the time to advance. After all, this was the core area of the Divine Palace of Creation and was filled with danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, the medicinal strength of this bit of wine was too strong. After it healed his injuries, there was still another half surging within his body, and it caused Chen Xi to have no choice but to circulate the strength in his entire body to suppress it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, a ball of blazing vitality was suppressed and shrunk into a ball by him, and then he gradually injected it into his body to be sealed up temporarily while preventing it from leaking and dissipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a divine wine is absolutely worth an unimaginable fortune. It simply doesn’t seem like something that ought to be possessed by the Mortal Dimension!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, Chen Xi opened his sparkling eyes that were deep yet bright, and his voice revealed a wisp of admiration.</span></p>

After all, unlike qi refinement, every single step in body refinement was difficult and obscure to the extreme.</span></p>

There’s a type of terrifying restriction ahead and coming into contact with it means certain death!”</span></p>

These scars stretched horizontally and vertically, and it seemed like the branches had been chopped by an axe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This…wouldn’t be a shell left behind by the Dark Parasol Divine Tree after it perished during the primeval times, right!?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked in his heart. Even though he was only looking at it from afar, he was still able to sense that the surroundings of this divine tree emitted a shapeless force field that enveloped this entire expanse of the heavens and the earth, and it was exceedingly terrifying.
