 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2b2fd85d-a16b-3cc7-410e-67c471c41200"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi noticed with a single glance that the figures flashing towards him from afar was precisely Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying had a delicate appearance with gorgeous hair that fluttered in the wind, and the beautiful features on her face revealed that she was in high spirits. Her aura was much stronger than before, and she’d obviously obtained a great amount of benefits from the secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Zhou’s bearing had changed greatly as well, it was more condensed and immovable, and every single move of his seemed lofty. His arrogant and overbearing bearing from before had vanished, and he instead seemed as if he couldn’t be looked down upon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Chen Xi had already discerned that the vital energy in their bodies had already attained perfection, and they were able to advance into the Rebirth Realm at any moment. All they lacked was the tribulation, and at this moment, they were entirely capable of easily overcoming it with their current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this indicated that both of them had surely obtained a great fortuitous encounter within the secret realm, and this caused Chen Xi to feel heartfelt happiness. His friends were safe and sound, and they’d even become stronger, how could this not be worthy of being happy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait for a moment. I’ll return after I deal with them.” With a sweep of his gaze, Chen Xi noticed that Qin Xiao and Pei Yu had seized the opportunity when he wasn’t paying attention to them to flee towards the distance, so Chen Xi notified them before turning around and pursuing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A reunion of friends was something that did indeed arouse happiness in the heart. But it was best to resolve matters that should be resolved and setting a tiger free to cause more trouble in the future wasn’t Chen Xi’s style of doing things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, Chen Xi had already vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying was stunned, and she lightly bit her red and moist cherry lips as she said with displeasure, “This fellow is such a bastard. We’ve come to help him, not be a burden.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. We must teach him a proper lesson once he returns.” Young Master Zhou chimed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The both of them had just left the secret realm when the heard the genius experts of the various Dynasties were pursuing Chen Xi all over the Isle of Fallen Treasures, causing both of them to instantly feel anxious and disregard everything to catch up to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when they rushed over to the swamp, they just happened to see Chen Xi sweep through all the experts and leave. In the end, they chased after Chen Xi all the way, yet were always a distance away, and every single time, they were only able to see the traces left behind by him, the traces of him killing every single enemy he saw, causing corpses to cover the land and the smell of blood to assault the nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until this moment, they’d finally caught up to Chen Xi’s footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they hadn’t even opened their mouths when Chen Xi had left once more to chase after Qin Xiao, Pei Yu, and Bi Lingyun, causing both of them to feel extremely depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them thought that after they obtained the inheritance in the secret realm, they could completely be capable of assisting Chen Xi with their current strength. Never had they imagined that they were still incapable of helping and were like burdens in Chen Xi’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go! We’ll go over together and let Chen Xi know how formidable we are.” Huangfu Qingying pouted and spoke with a disgruntled expression, and she seemed like a little girl that wanted to obtain praise by proving herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, we’ll catch up and let him know how strong we are.” Young Master Zhou rubbed his palms together and spoke with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them immediately stopped dallying and followed Chen Xi’s traces to chase after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go! Let’s go take a look. I truly never expected that Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou would actually come out from the secret realm, I wonder how great the benefits they obtained were…” The distant crowd of spectators were in an uproar, and they flashed out to chase after Chen Xi. They had no enmity with Chen Xi, so they naturally dared go over to spectate the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when all of them hurried over and saw Chen Xi once again, they couldn’t help but gasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi seemed to have just annihilated Pei Yu and Qin Xiao, and he was plundering the spoils. Qin Xiao’s Quasi Immortal Artifacts, Mountainform Seal and Golden Dragon Armor, Pei Yu’s Skysorrow Sword, all of them were held in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby mountains were completely destroyed, the ground entirely charred and covered in cracks, and it had just experienced a great battle. The chaotic flow of air hadn’t calmed and was still emitting ear piercing whistling sounds, yet there was no sign of Pei Yu and Qin Xiao’s figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Chen Xi remained in the battlefield…. No, there was still a green colored flying beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flying beast was covered in blood, its wings that were green like jade were extremely damaged, and at this moment, it lay barely breathing on the ground while blood flowed from the corners of its mouth. Obviously, it had suffered a heavy injury and was incapable of standing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is fucking heaven defying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the experts present were shocked. Two Crown Princes from first-rate Dynasties had been annihilated while their magic treasures were seized, and even the peerless flying beast, Inferno Crane, was heavily injured on the ground while barely breathing and had completely lost its ability to battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou were stunned as well, and they completely extinguished any thoughts of proving themselves before Chen Xi. Only now had they noticed that no matter how hard they worked, or how great the fortuitous encounters they obtained, they seemed to be unable to follow up to Chen Xi’s footsteps…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi finished clearing out his spoils before nodding to Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou, indicating that both of them should wait for a moment, and then he turned around to look at the Inferno Crane that lay on the ground while barely breathing. He intended to first cut off its single leg to study the innate Grand Dao profundities branded on its bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this flying beast was peerlessly beautiful when transformed into human form, Chen Xi knew deeply of her ferocity, so he naturally wouldn’t take any pity. However, before he could make a move, a voice suddenly sounded out from afar and interrupted his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, please show mercy.” A figure tore through the sky from afar, and he was still another few thousands of kilometers away when his voice resounded out, yet he’d already appeared before Chen Xi when his voice finished resounding out. His speed was extraordinarily swift and revealed his extremely formidable strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young man looked to be rather emaciated, his countenance pale, his eye sockets sunken, and his eyes revealed a trace of a strange ghastly white color that gave others a gloomy and ghostly feeling. It was precisely Ling Yu’s elder brother, the genius expert Ling Ze from the Dartang Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Brother Ling, you want to plead for mercy on behalf of this animal?” Chen Xi frowned. He had a rather good impression of Ling Ze, yet it was only a good impression, and if Ling Ze obstructed him from killing the Inferno Crane, then he would absolutely not agree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, you can’t kill this woman, as she’s the descendant of the peerless flying beast, Inferno Crane. She has long since been noticed by the Great Worldly Saint of Southollow Paradise since before entering the Primeval Battlefield, and the Great Worldly Saint has proclaimed the intention of taking her as a successor.” Ling Ze’s gaze swept the surroundings and reminded via voice transmission.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps Brother Chen doesn’t know, but the Southollow Paradise is an ancient power of the Dark Reverie, and its hidden resources and reserves are terrifying to the extreme. Moreover, the Great Worldly Saint is an Ancestor of the Southollow Paradise with extremely great ability. If you kill this woman, then you’ll undoubtedly offend a terrifying enemy, and the disadvantages of this action outweighs the benefits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he shook his head and said, “Brother Ling, this animal joined forces with others to attack me the other day with the intention of seizing my treasures. Now that she has become a prisoner of mine, wouldn’t everyone dare go against me if I let her go just like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He naturally believed Ling Ze’s words. After all, this fellow was from one of the three top Dynasties, the Dartang Dynasty, and he was extremely well informed, so he naturally wouldn’t deceive Chen Xi. But Chen Xi was extremely unwilling to let Bi Lingyun off just like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ze was stunned as well, and seemed to have never imagined that Chen Xi would actually still be so unyielding even after finding out this woman’s identity, and he couldn’t help but arouse a trace of admiration in his heart yet he smiled bitterly and said, “Truthfully speaking, even though my Dartang Dynasty is reputed as a top Dynasty and possesses a certain level of connection with some powers of the Dark Reverie, but when compared to a power like the Southollow Paradise, it’s no different than an ant. Brother Chen, you still have a long path ahead of you, it isn’t worth to bring extremely great trouble to yourself just for some enmity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Ling, she wanted to kill me. If it was you, would you be able to let her go so easily?” Chen Xi asked seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Ling Ze hesitated and felt it was rather troublesome as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can compensate you, and it’ll surely satisfy you.” On the ground, the Inferno Crane that was barely breathing suddenly struggled to stand up before transforming into a drop dead gorgeous woman, but her countenance was completely pale, and she seemed extremely weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Chen Xi remaining silent, she directly withdrew a jade slip and said, “This is the refinement technique of the ancient divine weapon, Flame God Fan. I think this jade slip is entirely capable of compensating you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Flame God Fan?!” Ling Ze’s pupils constricted, and the gaze he shot at the jade slip couldn’t help but carry a trace of burning desire. Even though it flashed momentarily, it was still noticed by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, just hearing the name allowed one to know the jade slip was extraordinary, and it actually recorded the method to refine an Immortal Artifact. If news of this was spread out, its value would absolutely be immeasurable, and just thinking about it caused one’s heart to be moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason I intended to seize your Flaming Peacock Fan was actually because this magic treasure was refined with a flaming feather of the Nether Peacock King, and it contains Triple-Defiance Divineflames. At the same time, it’s also one of the main materials to refine the Flame God Fan.” Bi Lingyun had completely resigned herself to defeat, and she made all her thoughts clear with the intention of obtaining Chen Xi’s forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was rather shocked in his heart as well. The Quasi Immortal Artifact, Flaming Peacock Fan, was actually a mere main material in refining the Flame God Fan, and he truly didn’t dare imagine exactly how terrifying its might would be after being refined successfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he pondered for a short moment yet still shook his head and said, “This is only the method to refine it and not the true treasure. Even if it’s given to me, I don’t know when I’ll be able to refine it, so it doesn’t mean much to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bi Lingyun was stunned and seemed to have never imagined that Chen Xi would still remain unmoved even after she gave away her most precious treasure, and then she looked at the nearby Ling Ze and seemed slightly at a loss for what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ze never imagined that Chen Xi would be unmoved as well, and he pondered for a moment and seemed to have thought of something, causing his eyes to light up as he said, “Brother Chen, I have a piece of information here, and I presume you’ll surely be interested. Just take it as Miss Bi’s compensation, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chen Xi’s brows raised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s related to Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing. They’re from the Darchu Dynasty just like you, and I guess your relationship isn’t bad with them, and that’s why I said this.” Ling Ze paused for a moment and continued. “I just obtained this information as well. Moreover, I guarantee that very few people know of this information. Of course, I’m absolutely not doing this for the sake of coercing you, but for the sake of displaying my sincerity and that I sincerely hope you’re able to let Miss Bi off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, deal.” Chen Xi agreed without the slightest hesitation. This piece of information was actually related to Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing, so he had no choice but to agree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ze was forthright as well, and he immediately passed over Bi Lingyun’s jade slip and the jade slip that recorded the information about Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing to Chen Xi as he said, “Brother Chen, look through these jade slips first. If there’s no problem with them, then I and Miss Bi will be leaving.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded before directly and carefully looking through a jade slip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trace of admiration was once again revealed from Ling Ze’s eyes when he saw this scene because he clearly saw that Chen Xi didn’t look through the refinement technique of the Flame God Fan, but had looked at the information relating to Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, in Chen Xi’s heart, no matter how important the technique for refining an Immortal Artifact was, it couldn’t compare to how important his companions were. This clearly indicated that Chen Xi was a person that valued his relationships and was loyal, and it was worth it for him to form a deep relationship with Chen Xi.&nbsp;</span></p>
