 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he didn’t care, and he chose a seat nearby the window and sat down before sipping wine and tea while sizing up everyone within the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person he paid the most attention to was the young man that came from one of the 10 great immortal sects, the Truth Embrace Sect, — Daoist Crimson Sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Crimson Sun wore an apricot yellow Daoist Robe, and he possessed a handsome appearance and extraordinary style. Every single move he made emitted an aura of returning to simplicity, and he seemed like a crane standing amongst chickens and was extremely conspicuous as he sat there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Chen Xi paid attention to this person was that during the time he was at the Primeval Battlefield, the Feng Clan’s Feng Jianbai was taken as a disciple by the Earthly Immortal Realm expert of the Truth Embrace Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, less than half a year of time had passed since they’d entered the Dark Reverie, and he was extremely curious about to what extent had Feng Jianbai’s cultivation attained now, and if Feng Jianbai would come to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought of Feng Jianbai, Chen Xi thought of Qing Xiuyi, Zhen Liuqing, Fan Yunlan, Zhao Qinghe, and the others. All of them were taken away by the experts of a great power and there was no further contact from them.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How are they now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when Chen Xi was pondering, a gaze that was like a bolt of lightning swept over abruptly and descended onto him, and it instantly jolted him awake from his thoughts. Chen Xi raised his eyes to look over, and it turned out to be Daoist Crimson Sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like my repeated sizing up of him has drawn his attention instead…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi laughed endlessly in his heart, and he drank a cup of wine before shooting his gaze towards outside the window.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the other side, Daoist Crimson Sun frowned before withdrawing his gaze, and a strand of suspicion clouded his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This unfamiliar young man is from the Nine Radiance Sword Sect and is following by Long Zhenbei and An Wei’s side. Could it be that he’s an extraordinary figure as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the hall, Long Zhenbei and An Wei were both chatting happily with some young geniuses. One of them was a formidable figure that possessed the Serpent Dragon’s Spiriteyes, whereas the other was a genius that was like a celestial maiden, so there was naturally no lack of people that were close to them, causing them to seem rather busy. Only Chen Xi sat alone before the table, and he seemed slightly lonely in the eyes of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi didn’t think like this. He’s stayed in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect for a long time and could be said to have led a very peaceful and even slightly quiet life. Now when he’d suddenly entered the outside world, he felt rather comfortable instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivators are weary of the noise of the mortal world and entering great sects to cultivate in peace is a type of enjoyment. But after staying within such paradises and being separated from the world for a long time, coming to the flourishing mortal world is a type of comprehension instead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi looked from afar at the luxuriant Icesoul Divine Tree outside the window as he listened to the wave of bustling noise in the hall, and he was rather deeply touched in his heart, causing him to be in a slight daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was like two lives. One was a painstaking cultivator that was behind closed doors deep within the mountains, and another was that of an eccentric that wandered within the mortal world. The experience was different, so one’s state of mind was naturally different as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?” Right when Chen Xi obtained slight comprehension, and his state of mind became peaceful and translucent, he suddenly sensed that there was actually a trace of an obscure Grand Dao profundities being emanated from within the distant Icesoul Divine Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an extremely unusual feeling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even faintly sensed that the Icesoul Divine Tree seemed to have a type of vitality pulsating within it, but it was extremely difficult to notice, and it vanished without a trace when he sensed it carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Long Zhenbei had already stopped chatting with the others and sat slowly by Chen Xi’s side, whereas An Wei notified Chen Xi before leaving the Ice Cloud Pavilion with a beautiful young woman with the intention of buying some things on the streets instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as An Wei left, the smile on Long Zhenbei vanished instantly, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly and carried a trace of arrogance as he said slowly, “Junior Brother Chen Xi, there’ll be some formidable figures rushing over to Icesky City in the next few days, and there’ll be no lack of enemies of our Nine Radiance Sword Sect. You have to be careful as I’m only able to protect the safety of Junior Sister An Wei with my ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meaning within his words was that if they encountered danger, then he would preferentially protect An Wei and not Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi remained silent and turned a deaf ear to it. At this moment, his entire mind had fallen onto the Icesoul Divine Tree outside the window, so how could he have the time to pay attention to Long Zhenbei?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention Long Zhenbei had already ‘made his stand known’ like this, so he couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath with Long Zhenbei. In any case, he never hoped that Long Zhenbei would be magnanimous to the point of taking care of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then… I’ll take it as you tacitly agreeing.” Long Zhenbei couldn’t help but be stunned when he saw Chen Xi actually remain indifferent and disregard him, and a wisp of anger inadvertently flashed within his eyes. Truthfully speaking, if it wasn’t for An Wei, he would utterly not join the same group with a nobody like Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi had carried out numerous great deeds that shocked the sect and had even injured a ferocious figure like Wang Zhonghuan, as for as Long Zhenbei was concerned, it was nothing worth mentioning and was entirely incapable of drawing his interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only regarded two things as being important. One was his strength, and the other was the beauty he took a fancy to. Everything else was of no importance to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, he was already standing proudly in the peak ranks of the Seed Disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect and was well-renowned in the world to the point he was treated with courtesy no matter where he went. Now that he had a genius beauty like An Wei following by his side, he could be said to be filled with pride and was extremely brilliant. So, why would he take Chen Xi seriously?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s truly an impenetrable fellow. Let me see how you obediently beg for my assistance when trouble comes looking for you!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Long Zhenbei glanced at Chen Xi and sneered endlessly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this period of time, a few more batches of experts from all around had successively entered this level of the pavilion, and they caused waves of clamorous noise to resound out as they discussed the matters related to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi ignored all of this because he’d made another shocking discovery!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vertical eye split open silently between his brows as he stared fixedly at the Icesoul Divine Tree outside the window, and he instantly noticed that there was actually a gentle brilliance of divinity flowing within the trunk of the tree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most shocking of it all was that there seemed to be an independent world opened up within the trunk of the tree, and it was extremely vast and covered with ancient and obscure marks of the Dao. Moreover, there was shockingly an ancient sacrificial altar floating at the center of the space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides this, there was a bronze coffin atop the sacrificial altar. The coffin was stained with rust, and he could faintly see numerous patterns like that of flowers, birds, fist, the stars, the sun, the moon, and the people of ancient times offering sacrifices to the gods. Moreover, it emitted an icy cold, ancient, and extremely mysterious aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An independent space, marks of the Grand Dao, an ancient sacrificial altar, a bronze coffin… There really is something hidden within this Icesoul Divine Tree, and if it wasn’t for me relying on the Eye of Divine Truth, it would probably be impossible for me to notice it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was extremely shocked in his heart because he never imagined he would discover such a shocking secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He circulated the Eye of Divine Truth with all his strength, causing even his eyes to emit a sharp pain and practically be on the verge of bleeding, and he finally saw the scene within the bronze coffin clearly. It was completely empty within, yet at the corner was an extremely inconspicuous charred piece of wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This charred piece of wood was only palm-sized, completely black, and seemed to have suffered a lightning strike. Its surface was faintly covered with strands of cracks, whereas there was actually an extremely tiny sapling growing out from one of the cracks. The sapling was young and verdant, and it flowed with strands of a gentle glow. The glow showered down like a misty drizzle, and it nurtured the charred piece of wood, causing it to be extremely miraculous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that this charred piece of wood was formed from the strand of soul the Dark Parasol Divine Tree left behind that An Wei mentioned earlier?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Chen Xi was shocked in his heart, and his heart couldn’t help but thump.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was simply too miraculous!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Who could have imagined that there was actually this sort of thing that was actually almost like a miracle within the Icesoul Divine Tree?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and calmed his excited feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Icesoul Divine Tree is extremely extraordinary. It has been standing here since countless years ago, and every single time the Dark Parasol’s Abyss is about to make an appearance, it would emit strands of the tune of the Grand Dao as if it was summoning something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, the existence of this Icesoul Divine Tree has already been enveloped by the Laws of the Grand Dao since a long time ago. Once it’s damaged, it would draw the attention of numerous great figures in the world. If it wasn’t for this, I really wish for nothing more than to chop it open and see exactly what secrets are hidden within it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, since the ancient times, countless extraordinary figures have come to search the Icesoul Divine Tree thoroughly with the intention of deducing its relationship with the Dark Parasol’s Abyss. But up until now, not a single person has seen through its secrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some experts of the various powers were discussing within the hall, and they weren’t afraid of anything because everything related to the Icesoul Divine Tree had already become an open secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was enlightened instead. From the conversation between these people, he’d faintly sensed that perhaps the scenes he’d seen earlier were the true secret of the Icesoul Divine Tree, and only by completely figuring it out would he perhaps be able to extract even more secrets related to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, some other experts entered into discussions as well, but what they spoke of was completely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In my opinion, no matter how miraculous the Icesoul Divine Tree is, it was only formed from a single leaf of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree, and the reason it’s capable of emitting the tune of the Grand Dao is entirely because it’s related to the Dark Parasol Divine Tree. As for whether there’re any other secrets concealed within it, that’s sheer nonsense, and even if there’re secrets concealed within it, it’s probably unrelated to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, it’s indeed so. If there’re secrets, then it would have been discovered by the various great figures since a long time ago. How could it be left for us to make great efforts to discover?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their words were similarly logical, and it won the agreement of many of the people present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned instead and took a deep breath before urging on the Eye of Divine Truth to pry into the Icesoul Divine Tree once again. His gaze was like a shuttle that penetrated through the independent space, the ancient sacrificial altar, the bronze coffin, and finally descended onto that piece of charred wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, he started to calmly comprehend the aura emitted by the piece of charred wood, and the outcome aroused shock in his heart. Because the strand of misty green aura emanated by the sapling on the charred piece of wood was actually like the source of the Grand Dao, and it contained the aura of the various Grand Daos in the world!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was tiny and weak to the extreme, Chen Xi knew clearly that his senses would absolutely not be mistaken, and it was surely the aura of the Grand Dao with absolute certainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s real. That’s indeed formed from the strand of soul of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree. I’ll help you obtain it, but you must agree to a condition of mine in exchange.” Right at this moment, the tiny cauldron that had been silent for a long time sent out a strand of a voice, and it was simply like a thunderclap that directly shocked Chen Xi on the spot.</span></p>
