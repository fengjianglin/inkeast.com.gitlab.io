 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of those cultivators had turned ashen from terror since long ago, and they were terrified to the point of almost falling to the floor. Their bodies even trembled abruptly when they heard this, and they waved their hands repeatedly. “No, no. we absolutely…absolutely didn’t say anything bad about Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their teeth were emitting cracking sounds from rubbing together, and they spoke intermittently as well. Obviously, they were greatly terrified.</span></p>

All of you still deceive your grandfather at a time like this. Your crimes really deserve death!” The stalwart middle aged man grunted coldly as baleful qi surged explosively in his entire body, and then jet black lights flowed on his body, causing him to seem as if he’d walked out from a sea of blood and mountain of corpses. Merely this dense killing intent caused them to feel as if they’d fallen into a pit of ice and caused their breathing to become difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right when everyone thought he was about to make a move, he suddenly turned around and glanced towards the side. “Who’re you? You seem to have been staring at me for a long time?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly.” The stalwart middle aged man liked his lower lip as he laughed gloomily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like my luck isn’t bad, and I’ve encountered you as soon as I entered Moontrace City. Very good, I can return to the sect and hand in the assignment after I kill you.” The young man in an embroidered robe spoke casually. “Now, I’ll give you two choices. The first, you slit your own throat; the second, I’ll make a move myself. Choose one of the two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the restaurant was stunned when they heard this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What an arrogant young man. He actually dared say he wants to kill the third demon, Lu Chong, of the seven dark pheasant demons? He’s simply courting death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of them were cultivators of Moontrace City, and they knew Lu Chong’s strength extremely well.

There were rumors that said that more than 100 thousand people had died at his hand!</span></p>
 <p>How could such a ferocious figure that was like a god of murder be an existence that anyone could kill?</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi had finally confirmed the identity of this stalwart middle aged man, and just like the young man in an embroidered robe, he felt it was a great coincidence that he actually found Lu Chong without even searching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha…” Lu Chong suddenly roared with laughter that was sharp, gloomy, and ear piercing, and a wisp of pity suffused his cruel gaze. “Pitiable, truly fucking pitiable. A tiny human at the 4<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm actually dared to brag like this. You’re simply tired of living! Based on your dressing, you ought to be a Core Disciple of the Cloudwater Sect. Unfortunately, you can’t be saved today even if the seniors of your sect come!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d killed countless people like flies and was frequently pursued by the disciples of the various sects yet he was still able life safely until now. What he relied on was his abundant experience from living on the edge of a blade and his decisive and ruthless combat strength, and it wasn’t so simple as just relying on luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you’re impervious to reason, then don’t blame me for being ruthless. I forgot to tell you, I’m called Fang Xingzhou, a Core Disciple of the Cloudwater Sect, and being able to die at my hand can be considered to be a good fortune of yours.” The young man called Fang Xingzhou stood up, his posture was elegant while his words revealed an arrogant feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” Lu Chong grunted coldly yet his expression went grim abruptly, and then he stared fixedly behind Fang Xingzhou as if someone that he had to take seriously was there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Xingzhou was stunned and glanced over as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kid, you’re really inexperienced!” It was at this moment that Lu Chong revealed a complacent and savage smile as he flashed out, and his right hand that possessed thick and large joints was covered in a wisp of surging jet black light as he punched down at the top of Fang Xingzhou’s skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Despicable!” Fang Xingzhou was furious, and he slapped out instinctively from being caught off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

This restaurant that was the most bustling in Moontrace City was unable to resist the terrifying impact of this collision in the end, and it rumbled as it collapsed, causing dust and dirt to suffuse the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the guests within the restaurant had already fled long ago as if they were running for their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fang Xingzhou went out as well. But he was blasted flying by Lu Chong’s palm strike. His figure descended onto the street outside while in a sorry state, and his countenance was already pale to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d obviously suffered a huge loss from this palm strike that caught him off guard.</span></p>

He was extremely experienced, and it was obvious from this that this fellow’s combat style was extremely ruthless, decisive, and indifferent to methods used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blood red and enormous hand soared through the sky and emitted an extremely evil, gloomy, and vicious aura as it pressed down like a mountain at Fang Xingzhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The True Essence and vital blood within Fang Xingzhou’s body became sluggish and he was practically unable to breathe while being enveloped beneath the might of this palm.</span></p>

You’re courting death!” At the critical moment, Fang Xingzhou roared loudly as he suddenly bit open the tip of his tongue, causing his imposing aura to suddenly rise explosively by more than double. After that, he flashed out while his palms carried a dazzling green light that rumbled as it smashed towards the palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

However, the blood red hand was extremely solid, strong like a mountain, and carried a shocking corrosive force. As soon as the green light collided with it, the green light seemed like snow that melted in water, and it was melted and dispersed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Lu Chong miss such a great opportunity? He pursued him closely and laughed gloomily as he said, “A single mistake causes every subsequent step to be wrong. You thought your cultivation was extraordinary, yet your experience is extremely horrible. I’ve fucking killed countless fledglings like you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! Do you really think I’m a fish on your chopping board that’s at your mercy?” Fang Xingzhou knew that he’d been careless this time, and if he didn’t turn the situation around swiftly, then he would surely die on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So a medicinal pill had appeared in his hand as he spoke. The pill was crimson red like fire, crystalline, translucent, emitted rays of light, and faintly emitted the roars of dragons and howls of tigers. Its quality was extremely extraordinary.</span></p>

After I consume this pill, my strength will rise explosively to the 5<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm for 15 minutes, and my injuries from before will be completely suppressed. Let me see how you fight me now!” Fang Xingzhou laughed coldly as he shouted loudly, and he actually took the initiative to charge at Lu Chong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

Both of them were locked in battle while the buildings by their sides rumbled as they collapsed. Numerous and enormous rifts and ravines were even blasted open on the ground, and their fight was extremely intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were already many people spectating in the surroundings before this, and there was no lack of some disciples from other sects that had come to Moontrace City to carry out assignments. All their expressions turned heavy when they saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, Chen Xi’s figure stood amongst the crowd as well.</span></p>

Die!” Lu Chong shouted explosively with a sharp voice as an expanse of a bloody glow rumbled and gushed out from his body, and it was like a river of blood that descended from the heavens and intended to drown Fang Xingzhou within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! It’s impossible for you to kill me!” Fang Xingzhou was filled with confidence after his strength increased greatly, and his figure shot into the sky like a sharp arrow before he stretched his hand out and struck out with an expanse of extraordinary punches that emitted dazzling green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AH!!” However, in the next moment, a shrill cry of pain resounded out. Fang Xingzhou’s entire body was actually blasted fiercely onto the ground, causing the bones in his entire body to break inch by inch. He coughed out large mouthfuls of blood incessantly, and he was already on the verge of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Despicable! You actually concealed your strength!”</span></p>

The gaze he shot at Fang Xingzhou seemed like the gaze of a cat teasing a mouse, brutal and ridiculing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll absolutely not let you off in my next lifetime…” Fang Xingzhou glared his eyes wide open with rage, and he breathed his last breath unwillingly. At the moment before his death, he was actually feeling regret already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He regretted not fleeing directly, he regretted taking this assignment, and he regretted encountering a crafty and cunning demon like Lu Chong. If he was reborn, then he would absolutely not take risks for the sake of reputation and wealth while losing his own life in the end…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>

After that, he walked forward and intended to plunder Fang Xingzhou’s wealth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that as a Core Disciple of the Cloudwater Sect, Fang Xingzhou surely carried a large amount of treasures. So if he didn’t take it for himself, could it be that he should let another benefit?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ruthless, vicious, cunning, crafty, and unscrupulous… Ling Bai and Qing Yu might really have been schemed against when encountering an enemy like this…” A soft mutter suddenly sounded out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who said that!?” Lu Chong’s ears were extremely sensitive. He instantly stopped moving before looking over towards the source of the voice with a gloomy and ruthless expression, and he instantly locked onto his target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a young man that was handsome and extraordinary.</span></p>

I’ve just dealt with a disciple of the Cloudwater Sect and another has appeared. What? You want to die on the street like him as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he spoke like this, he couldn’t help but be bewildered in his heart because he was actually unable to sense this young man before him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly what level has his cultivation attained. This… is slightly strange.</span></p>

Why exactly have you come here? Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!” Lu Chong spoke ferociously before Chen Xi could open his mouth because Lu Chong wanted to probe Chen Xi before making a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the numerous gazes of surprise that came from the surroundings, Chen Xi walked neither swiftly nor slowly out of the crowd, and he had a calm and tranquil expression as he said indifferently, “I just want to borrow your head.”</span></p>
