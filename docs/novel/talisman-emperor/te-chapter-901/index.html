He possessed a thin and plain appearance, and the only thing that gave others a deep impression was his pair of beautiful peach blossom shaped eyes and his hair that was braided into a thick and glossy bun.</span></p>

It has been a long time since I’ve seen an opponent that filled me with such anticipation. Oh, killing him will probably be able to make me very excited.” Bai Juan’s eyes narrowed like a venomous snake that had targeted its prey, and his eyes were suffused with a bloodthirsty and gloomy sheen.</span></p>

But right after that, he rubbed his chin while he chuckled. “But I really look forward to fighting that kid.”</span></p>

I thought you’d targeted that fierce bear.” Bai Juan glanced at Bai Qun and spoke unhurriedly.</span></p>

I didn’t forget our objective this time. It’s only a fierce bear, so I naturally have a myriad of methods to deal with it after I defeat Chen Xi. Perhaps, taming it to become my combat beast isn’t a bad choice.” Bai Qun grinned as he spoke with a warm appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s mine.” Suddenly, a low and deep voice that revealed a strand of a unique rhythm sounded out, and it was like a sword mottled with rust being drawn from a rotten sheath. It wasn’t ear piercing, yet it caused others to be uncomfortable.</span></p>

The right side of her face was covered in a pitch black mask, causing only half of her beautiful face to be revealed.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though she stood there alone, no one dared to overlook her existence, and her multicolored clothes caused her to carry a sense of horrifying beauty.</span></p>

Moreover, everyone in the Bai Clan knew that so long as she made a decision, then no one &nbsp;was capable of changing it, not even the higher-ups of the Bai Clan!</span></p>

The assignment this time is very important. The Grand Elder has already put forward an absolute order that even if we fight to the death, we have to eliminate Chen Xi!”</span></p>

No matter if it was the layout or decoration, everything was filled with a rough and fierce style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stood within the courtyard that belonged to him and seemed to be silently scanning everything in his surroundings, but his mind had already surged into the world of stars instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s clone that wore an apricot yellow Daoist robe sat cross-legged beneath the myriad of stars in the sky, and it was deducing and comprehending the Eternal Dao Scripture. Perhaps it could be said that since Chen Xi left the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, his clone had always been doing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Dao Scripture converged the supreme inheritance of Eternal Spirit Mountain, and it contained the Eternal Dao Insight and the Dao Art that corresponded to the Eternal profundity — The Five Moves of the Eternal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, his clone had already more or less comprehended this Dao Art, but he was merely able to completely grasp and bring forth the might of three moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this was caused by Chen Xi’s grasp of the Eternal Dao Insight having not reached perfection, and it was even to the extent that it hadn’t reached the Advanced Realm, so the incompleteness of his Dao Insight directly held back his grasp of this Dao Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi wasn’t anxious because supreme Dao Insights like the Grand Dao of Eternal, Paramita, Oblivion, Obliteration, Creation, and so on and so forth were things that were extremely difficult to grasp in a short period of time even with his extraordinary comprehension ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was like the polishing of a rock by flowing water, it required accumulation over a long period of time and one had to take one’s time to accomplish it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, comparatively speaking, he’d already saved much more time when compared to other cultivators because he possessed a clone whose ability of deduction was equivalent to his main body and the world of stars that contained extremely miraculous Temporal Laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So long as his clone comprehended here silently, attaining perfection in all these rare Grand Dao profundities was only a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, my clone is still unable to sense the energy of the heavy tribulation to advance into the Earthly Immortal Realm. Could it be that the problem is in the Worldmend Technique?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi withdrew his thoughts from the world of stars, and he frowned while pondering silently.</span></p>

But it walked on the pure path of the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In these past few years, his clone had attained the perfection-stage in the Nether Transformation Realm a long time ago, yet it was unable to sense the energy of the heavenly tribulation to advance to the Earthly Immortal Realm after so long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of feeling was as if Chen Xi’s clone had been overlooked by the Heaven Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, my clone shares the same fate as me, and it’s just like a part of my body. Since my main body has already overcome the heavenly tribulation, this has probably already included my clone. Perhaps so long as its body refinement cultivation is accumulated to the limit, then it would utterly have no need to sense the energy of the heavenly tribulation before easily striding into the Earthly Immortal Realm…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi pondered deeply for a short moment before he stopped thinking. Even if his clone was unable to ascend into the Earthly Immortal Realm, he wouldn’t be too regretful because there was no need for him to improve in strength in all aspects, and just possessing a will to fight without end was more than enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmm?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Chen Xi sensed something in his heart, and he raised his eyes to look outside the courtyard. His gaze was deep and seemed to see through the layer upon layer of space to directly arrive far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his sea of consciousness, a blood thirsty and murderous beautiful figure instantly floated up into appearance.</span></p>

He knew that the second test of his strength had arrived after Bai Tuo was defeated.</span></p>

He naturally knew that no matter if it was A’Man or Ling Bai, both of them actually had too much fury suppressed in their hearts from A’xiu’s forced departure, and they didn’t have anywhere to vent this fury.</span></p>

Moreover, there seemed to be various precious spirit fruits that could never be depleted in her possession.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why not?” Ling Bai wore white clothes while his small face was covered in a murderous expression. Even though he was only a few inches tall, he gave others a peerlessly fierce and piercing pain.</span></p>

There was no intention to mock or ridicule, and it seemed like she was stating a fact.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, everyone seemed as if they’d seen a peerless sword being unsheathed and revealing its edge, and it intended to pierce a hole through the skies.</span></p>

It was a type of response between sword cultivators, and it was a posture of battle from being eager to enter into battle because one’s interest had been awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>

Its edge was thick and branded with mottled spots of dark red colored marks of blood. As soon as it appeared, the aura that effused out from the sword tore open numerous scars in space, and it emanated strands of sharp and ear piercing crackles.</span></p>

The spots of mottled dark red bloodstains branded on the blade represented numerous great figures that had been killed with the blade of this sword, and the weakest amongst them was at the Heavenly Immortal Realm!</span></p>
