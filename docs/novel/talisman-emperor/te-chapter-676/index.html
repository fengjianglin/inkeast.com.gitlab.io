 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What had those two Xeno-race experts come here to search for?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t know. He only knew clearly that all he had to do was act according to the directions of the tiny cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he could make a move, a shadow flashed before him eyes, and a divine tree that was suffused with divine radiance actually appeared once more in midair before rooting itself there once more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its trunk was ramrod straight like the backbone of the universe, its branches were silver and shiny like the milky way that lay across the universe, and its leaves were completely round and just happened to be like numerous stars that hung at the end of the branches while spraying down silver radiance and a flowing rain of light, causing it to seem miraculous and extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Chen Xi was already aware that this ought to be the original appearance of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree during the primeval times, but it seemed to be even more slender and pure. The tree was only 3km tall, and it was far from being sufficient to connect the Immortal Dimension and the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the aura it emitted was so grand, and it emanated peerless divine might. It seemed to have gathered everything in the world to become the one and only backbone of the universe, causing others to feel a tiny and reverent feeling before it and wish for nothing more than to kneel down in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi knew that this was only an illusory shadow and not a real object. Earlier, that male Xeno-race expert had shattered it with a flick of his sleeve, so Chen Xi naturally wouldn’t take it seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take it!” The tiny cauldron spoke abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Chen Xi was astounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is a shadow, so how do I take it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there’s a shadow, there’s naturally a real object. Otherwise, where did the shadow come from? Quickly circulate that strand of the Dark Parasol’s soul within your body and sense carefully. Perhaps you’ll be able to obtain a piece of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s Grand Dao quintessence. Its value is so great that Grand Dao Fragments are absolutely incapable of comparing with it.” The tiny cauldron explained swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart shook as he hurriedly circulated his Blackhole World to emanate the strength of the Dark Parasol sapling. After a long time, his eyes lit up, and he felt extremely excited in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, he’d already sensed that a divine tree that was suffused with a divine radiance was surprisingly rooted within a mysterious space in the distance, and it was exactly similar in appearance to the divine tree he saw before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, it seemed to have noticed the aura of the Dark Parasol sapling within Chen Xi’s body, causing space to tremble as the divine tree in that mysterious space flashed before it appeared before Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike the shadow he’d seen earlier, this divine tree really did exist. No matter if it was its branches or leaves, all of them flowed with strands of the tune of the Dao while their veins were clearly visible. Even the aura it emitted was extremely vast and suffused the entire space while resounding with waves of the wonderful tune of the Grand Dao that seemed like the sound of nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a treasure! I actually sensed the Grand Dao auras of Yin, Yang, lightning, wind, and so on and so forth from within it!” Chen Xi exclaimed with admiration while his gaze burned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was said that the Grand Dao Fragments he obtained in the Dark Parasol Secret Realm were numerous individual things, then the divine tree &nbsp;before him was a whole. It was formed from numerous Grand Dao fragments, and its value was so great that it simply exceeded the summed-up total of a variety of Grand Dao Fragments!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strictly speaking, this divine tree couldn’t be considered to be a Grand Dao Fragment any longer, but a strand of the quintessence energy of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree left behind by it after it perished. It contained the various profundities of the Dao the Dark Parasol Divine Tree had mastered, and if it was placed in the outside world, it was sufficient to make anyone kill for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right when Chen Xi stretched out his hand to grab towards the divine tree, he felt the surrounding space tremble as a terrifying energy assaulted him like a bolt of flashing thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This energy was extremely terrifying, and it caused him to feel horrified. He practically didn’t hesitate in the slightest to flash out and dodge to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But unlike the past, his posture when dodging this time was extremely strange. His footsteps flashed repeatedly like a wriggling snake, yet his speed didn’t slow down in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Dao Art that was filled with clear azure light exploded at the place he was standing originally, causing waves of air to surge and stretch towards the surroundings while emitting a wave of sonic booms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi saw the appearance of the person that launched a sneak attack against him clearly, Chen Xi face sank instantly while his gaze turned icy cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Kid, is such a divine thing something you can have a share in?” A cold shout sounded out, and then over 10 tall figures appeared, and they looked at Chen Xi with gazes that revealed a wisp of resentment and killing intent without concealing it in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, they were those Earthly Immortal Realm experts that came from the various powers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When facing such figures and a total of 10 plus at once, an ordinary Nether Transformation Realm cultivator would probably have been scared stiff since a long time ago and would flee as far as he could. After all, both parties were utterly not at the same level, and killing a Nether Transformation Realm cultivator was simply easier than squashing an ant to an Earthly Immortal Realm expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi didn’t flee, his expression was calm and didn’t even carry a trace of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why aren’t you fleeing? Have you been scared out of your wits? That damnable Emperor Ant isn’t here to save you this time!” An Earthly Immortal Realm expert sneered while looking at Chen Xi with a gaze that was like cold lightning, and he spoke hatefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi?” Ancestor Ling Ya and Feng Xuanzi recognized Chen Xi with a single glance, and they were extremely surprised. Earlier, when they were fighting with the Emperor Ant, they’d already caught a whiff of something familiar from Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until this moment when they saw Chen Xi’s appearance clearly, they completely recognized him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little fellow is actually that young man we saw in the Primeval Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe! You really could have gone anywhere yet you just had to come here. Because of Yun Lansheng’s obstruction that day, you were allowed to escape calamity, you damnable little bastard! Let me see who can save you this time!” When Ancestor Ling Ya recalled those juniors of his Shang Clan that had been killed by Chen Xi, it felt as if a blazing flame was burning within his heart, and his gaunt and old face turned exceedingly ghastly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Xuanzi’s gaze flickered without end as well. That day in the Primeval Battlefield, he’d intentionally ignored the names of those disciples from the Darchu Dynasty during the announcement of the recruitment list because he received instructions from Bing Shitian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, not only had this little fellow not died, the little fellow was healthy and well to the point of even being innumerable times stronger than that day, and it caused him to be unable to help but feel a trace of astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, a wisp of killing intent gushed out into his heart. The enmity had already been sown, so if he were to allow this little fellow to continue growing, then the little fellow might become a great future trouble, so it was better for him to seize the opportunity and utterly annihilate Chen Xi now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Earthly Immortal Realm experts noticed their unusual expressions and undisguised killing intent, causing them to be extremely surprise in their hearts yet none of them asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s only a little ant at the Nether Transformation Realm! He was allowed to escape a calamity before, but he can’t be let off again this time!</span></p>

Taking a single wrong step would move you far away even though it’s only a step apart, and you wouldn’t be able to find the way out any longer. All of you are already a bag of bones, so it’s best not to be impulsive like young people.”</span></p>

Die!” An Earthly Immortal Realm expert couldn’t restrain the flames of his rage, and he shouted out coldly as he too a step forward before raising his hand to cause an exceedingly thick and large flaming bolt of lightning to strike down fiercely at Chen Xi.</span></p>

The cold shout was still reverberating in the surroundings yet that Earthly Immortal Realm expert that made a move had actually weirdly vanished without a trace!</span></p>

This place looked to be close, yet they seemed as if they were separated by an extremely far distance, and it was exceedingly strange.</span></p>

All of you don’t even have the courage to take a step forward, and I would rather slit my throat if I were all of you.” Chen Xi roared with laughter as he gestured with his hand and grabbed the divine tree that was suffused with a divine radiance in his palm, and then he turned around and headed in the hall. “Old Farts, excuse me for not accompanying all of you!”</span></p>
