 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, no one doubted that his words weren’t true.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was any other person, the person’s confidence and will to fight would probably be smashed after hearing this, and the person would take the initiative to admit defeat. But obviously, all of this was unable to affect Chen Xi’s will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he started cultivating until now, he’d experienced countless dangers and hardships, and he’d encountered countless more situations that were even more dangerous that the one he was in now, so how could he be affected by a few words?</span></p>

With this will, you have the qualifications to make me execute a second punch!” Bai Jingchen roared with laughter, and his gaze was like a bolt of lightning. “This second punch is called Grand Dao Cage, you better to watch out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

It seemed as if he’d transformed into the sovereign of judgment that controlled the world, and he wanted to transform the world into a cage that confined the Grand Dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The might of his fist hadn’t even spread out when force that carried the energy of the heavens and the earth completely enveloped and locked onto Chen Xi, causing him to be unable to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi had the feeling that if Bai Jingchen’s fist were to be struck out, then he wouldn’t have any chance to dodge or escape because his soul, vital energy, figure, and even everything around him was locked onto. No matter where he fled to, he would be unable to escape the envelopment of this punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grand Dao Cage!” Bai Jingchen moved amidst a rumble, and he struck out with his fist. It seemed to be slow yet was swift, and it seemed to be slow like a snail but was even swifter than a bolt of lightning. It was an extremely conflicting feeling, and it completely warped the knowledge of cultivators towards the profundities of time and space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s hairs stood on end. He was completely locked onto by the Fist Insight of Bai Jingchen, and it felt as if he was abandoned by the Grand Dao and locked within a cage where the Grand Dao was warped, causing all energy to fall into a chaotic state of being confined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This punch was capable of being described as being able to shake the heavens and the earth!</span></p>

All the Immortal Energy in his body seemed like flames that were burning with rage, and they transformed into a surging torrent that poured into the Talisman Armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these phantoms were like primeval gods that had awakened, and they stood loftily in Chen Xi surroundings. They reflected the workings of the heavens and illuminated the world, and the impetus they revealed was vast to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But all of this seemed nonexistent when facing that terrifying fist. It directly smashed through all barriers and charged out before blasting towards Chen Xi’s chest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an extremely critical moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he were to be hit at this moment, then even if Chen Xi survived, he would fall to the ground with a heavy injury, and it would take countless years for him to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this extremely critical moment, Chen Xi’s experience that he’d tempered through blood and battle had been flawlessly revealed. He converged all his will and all the energy in his body before condensing it into energy in the Talisman Armament and slashed out with it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of everyone turned grim when they noticed this terrifying airflow approaching them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Freeze!” Right at this moment, the Grand Elder Bai Cheng suddenly shouted out explosively, and then he flashed up into midair while his arms fluttered repeatedly. He formed a screen of light that covered the sky and completely separated the surroundings of the martial practice grounds, and he used this to deal with the terrifying aftershock that was spreading out, causing everyone else to feel like they were fish in a pond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short moment, everyone looked towards the center of the martial practice grounds with residual shock in their hearts. They saw Chen Xi still standing on the spot without moving, but his figure emanated a wave of dense sound of shattering, and it seemed as if the flesh and bones within his body had suffered destruction and damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The facts were indeed so. At this moment, the terrifying might of Bai Jingchen’s second punch had practically completely invaded his body, and that might was sufficient to destroy a lofty city!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu! Pu! Pu!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a few deep breaths and exerted all his strength to circulate the Dark Parasol Sapling, causing strands of surging Immortal Energy to charge into his damaged meridians, broken bones, and cracked flesh and skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the injuries of his flesh, his soul had even suffered a heavy injury, and it was dispirited and practically dried up, causing it to reveal signs of decline and death. But before he could repair his soul this time, the River Diagram fragments in his sea of consciousness suddenly emanated strands of fluctuation that suffused his entire soul, and then peerlessly abundant vitality started to arise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heavily injured and dispirited soul actually started recovering at an unbelievable speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi suffered a heavy injury in this collision, and it was the most severe injury he’d suffered in the recent years and could be said to be one that put him on the verge of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But under this terrifying pressure, his spirits obtained an extremely great improvement, and he even noticed numerous aspects that he was deficient in. This was the most precious experience he got from this collision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The martial practice grounds were completely silent, deathly silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked at Chen Xi with gazes that carried a wisp of shock and an indescribable feeling. They seemed to have never imagined that he would actually be able to receive Bai Jingchen’s second punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very good! The might of this strike is already slightly skillful, and your combat consciousness isn’t bad. Unfortunately, you’re still too far away from your goal of defeating Bing Shitian!” Bai Jingchen spoke in a low voice and broke the silence in the martial practice grounds. “Even though your recovery is shocking, you must remember that the enemy will never give you the slightest time to catch your breath during a true battle! So never place your thoughts on any other place, and the only thing you can trust is the strength you possess!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi understood this principle as well. But he didn’t understand it so deeply as he did at this moment because Bai Jingchen wasn’t wrong, if these two punches came successively, then he would absolutely be lying on the ground a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Jingchen’s voice reverberated endlessly in the martial practice grounds, and everyone seemed to be lost in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Again!” After a short moment, a low and deep voice that was hoarse like grains of sand rubbing together sounded out from Chen Xi’s mouth. Along with this voice, Chen Xi raised his head slowly, and his originally dim eyes brightened gradually before becoming blazing like two stars.</span></p>

Merely this imposing aura shook everyone in the surroundings of the martial practice grounds to the point of retreating uncontrollably.</span></p>

But his spirit, energy, and essence had attained an unprecedented peak state. However, when facing this punch where ‘great skill concealed itself, great sound became silent, and great appearance became shapeless,’ a type of empty and powerless feeling still arose in his heart.</span></p>

This little fellow really deserved to be an extraordinary genius. He actually fused with the Grand Dao at this moment and fell into a profound state of Dao comprehension.” A glow that was bright like lightning flashed past Bai Jingchen’s eyes, whereas his punch didn’t slow down in the slightest and silently enveloped down at Chen Xi.</span></p>
