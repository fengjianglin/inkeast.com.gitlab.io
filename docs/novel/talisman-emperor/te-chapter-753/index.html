 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, regardless of if it was inner court disciples, outer court disciples, Elite Disciples, Core Disciples, or even those elders and higher-ups, all of them were discussing the same name — Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this past year, if it was in terms of the person with the most resounding reputation in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, then it would surely be Chen Xi. Since the moment he joined the sect, he’d created stir after stir and miracle after miracle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, a legendary figure like this had returned while carrying a monstrous reputation, and he’d completely stirred the entire Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, the disciples started to become distracted when cultivating, the elders were frequently lost in thought while teaching, and it was even to the extent the disciples that guarded the entrance to the sect had exceedingly absent-minded expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When their cultivation ended, their classes finished, and it was time to be substituted at their posts of guarding the entrance, the distraction in their minds were completely wiped away while their spirits rose, and then all of them charged excitedly towards West Radiance Peak. They wanted to pay a visit to Chen Xi, and they wanted to see this legendary figure that was like the scorching sun in the midday sky within the entire Dark Reverie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">West Radiance Peak was unusually bustling and crowded with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t return to Divine Radiance Peak, but moved into West Radiance Peak because with his current cultivation there wasn’t any difference no matter where he cultivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But never had he imagined that so many people would come pay him a visit today, and even if he arranged for Meng Wei and the others to entertain the guests, they were still indescribably busy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was able to sense that regardless of the strength or status of these disciples and elders, all of them carried good intentions when paying him a visit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These sort of good intentions were either contained within reverence or mixed within gazes of admiration. All in all, so long as there were no unwanted guests paying him a visit, then he would welcomed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Wei, An Ke, Long Zhenbei, and the others had come as well, and they helped Chen Xi take care of all the disciples and some elders of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Lie Peng and the other Earthly Immortal Realm elders handed over the Eternal Dao Scripture to Chen Xi and chatted with him for a long time before leaving swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Lie Peng and the others had left, when this scene entered into the eyes of the other disciples and elders, it caused them to feel even more admiration towards Chen Xi. All of them decided in their hearts that they would get on good terms with Chen Xi, and even if they were only able to form some goodwill with Chen Xi, it was still a type of honor for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the guests that came to visit wouldn’t come empty handed. Those with ordinary backgrounds gifted some spirit flowers and spirit herbs that they collected with great effort. Those from well off backgrounds were even more generous, and they sent over numerous precious treasures from all over the world to the West Radiance Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were so many gifts that if they were to be piled up together, they would simply be able to be piled into a mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Chen Xi could even react to what had happened, the empty spirit farmlands and herb gardens on West Radiance Peak had numerous spirit herbs, spirit flowers, and precious medicines planted on them. Moreover, even the gorges and forests had numerous precious and variant beasts moving about within them, causing the West Radiance Peak to seem full of vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the benefit from ‘might.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi had just joined the Nine Radiance Sword Sect for a year, his display overshadowed most of the disciples, causing him to be extremely dazzling to the point even Chen Langya was extremely dim before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could they dare to not pay a visit to such a figure? And how could they dare to come empty handed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Elite Disciples of the East Radiance Peak had come as well, and they’d come to return the treasures. Chen Xi had given them 10 days to return the treasures, yet after they experienced the miserable lesson from yesterday, how could they dare to delay?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they clearly knew that the West Radiance Peak was overflowing with guests and crowded with people, they could only summon up the courage to go over, and they seemed like they’d committed crimes as they avoided the gazes of everyone and hastily sent over the treasures before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be helped, the bashing they received yesterday was truly too ruthless, and they hadn’t recovered up until now. All of them had swollen faces or staggered along, causing them to be in an indescribably sorry state, and they would surely die of embarrassment if someone saw them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it couldn’t be helped that their appearance was still noticed by some hawk eyed people, and it instantly caused a stir. Everyone moved far away from them as if avoiding the plague, and they pointed at them while discussing in low voices, causing their faces to flush red with embarrassment and wish for nothing more than to find a hole to hide themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t continue making it difficult for them. He only took the treasures before allowing them to leave. His attitude was neither hostile nor friendly, but his actions drew the cheers of numerous people instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone constantly praised him for being broad-minded, magnanimous, forgiving, and repaying hate with kindness, and they said he possessed the bearing of a kindhearted and just saint of the primeval times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was noticed by those disciples of the East Radiance Peak, and they were depressed to the point of being on the verge of spitting blood.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Chen Xi’s like a primeval saint, then what are we? Despicable scum?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi finally sent off the last guest when the veil of night descended, and he couldn’t help but heave a long sigh of relief. He felt that entertaining and sending guests off was simply more tiring that a fierce battle with his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei, Mo Ya, and the other youths were very tired as well, and they went to rest a long time ago. Only A’xiu was still excited, and she had her hand behind her back while she leaped about and sized up the piles of treasures on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these treasures were precious and variant treasures of varying colors. They flowed with a multicolored sheen and possessed various profound uses. But they were far from being practical, and they were mostly decoration and jewelry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But A’xiu didn’t care about that. Just like all women, she loved these things that glittered and sparkled with sheens of various color. She selected a string of jade white pearls and wore them on her neck before selecting a bracelet inlaid with a string of silver gems and wore it on her white wrist, and she was bustling about with pleasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, her neck, ears, wrists, ankles, and waist were all covered in multicolored treasures, and they were exceedingly dazzling under the veil of night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was dumbstruck by this scene. He suddenly recalled that these things seemed to have been given to him by those female disciples from North Radiance Peak.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t even care if it’s useful to me…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But obviously, this jewelry had delighted A’xiu, and based on her rosy cheeks and slightly curled up little mouth, it was clear how happy and satisfied she was at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, when exactly will you let me leave?” When Chen Xi intended to return to his room, Xue Yan who’d always kept silent with puckered lips like someone who had been bullied was finally unable to restrain herself from speaking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she was able to move about freely, she was restrained by the restrictions placed on her by A’xiu, causing her to be no different than an ordinary person. So Chen Xi wasn’t worried that she would escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll let you go right away when Bing Shitian sends over those senior brothers and senior sister of mine.” Chen Xi replied casually before turning around and entering his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! Fucking bastard!” Xue Yan was furious. She bit her supple and sexy red lips and wished for nothing more than to take a few bites out of Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, little fox demon. Come over and help me see if these droplet earrings are nice?” A’xiu spoke abruptly while holding a pair of droplet earrings that were suffused with a dim blue sheen.</span></p>

They’re made from bright Ocean Blue Calcedony, have been made with careful and precise craftsmanship, and Master couldn’t be any more beautiful when your beauty is being complemented by it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Master!</span></p>

But she couldn’t do anything about it because she was under the control of A’xiu, and she could only do this for the sake of leaving with her life intact.</span></p>

It seemed as if A’xiu was training a slave, and the slightest disobedience would cause the restrictions within her body to be activated and torture her to the point she wished for nothing more than to take her own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She swore that she wasn’t willing to feel it ever again!</span></p>

But when facing this woman, A’xiu, she was completely helpless.</span></p>

Especially when one woman was torturing another woman, their methods would simply be even more terrifying than men.</span></p>

But don’t worry, the day will come when I’ll surely train you into a qualified servant.” A’xiu glared at Xueyan while puckering her lips, and then she turned her head around proudly and couldn’t be bothered to pay any further attention to Xueyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xueyan couldn’t help but be aggrieved when she heard this, and she wished for nothing more than to wail and cry. At this moment, she strongly desired to leave this place and leave this little devil that deserved to be sliced into a thousand pieces!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

So Lie Peng asked him to make the best use of his time and comprehend it, and it would be an enormous gain if he were able to comprehend a trace of the Eternal Dao Insight.</span></p>
