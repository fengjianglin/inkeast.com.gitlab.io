Does he not know a top expert like Yan Shisan is right beside me?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmm?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Qingyan had awoken from her inner world when facing such an unexpected change in events, and her clear eyes swept out. Her beautiful brows knit together when she saw all her senior sisters were in confrontation with Bai Gunan, yet in the next moment, she was instantly stunned upon noticing Chen Xi who was at the table beside her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he’s here as well…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi noticed Su Qingyan looking over as well, and he smiled yet didn’t say anything. At this moment, all his attention was placed on Bai Gunan, and truthfully speaking, he actually admired this fellow slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because this fellow’s level of arrogance and overbearing could simply be said to be audacious to the extreme since he dared to turn hostile against the disciples of the Heavenly Insight Palace within their territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’re you looking at? Quickly come over and apologize to my brother!” Bai Gunan’s brows raised as he berated loudly, and he didn’t have the slightest intention of pitying a woman. He seemed as if he was berating a maidservant that had committed a mistake, and he was arrogant to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused everyone in the hall to be exceedingly shocked in their hearts because they never imagined that once this fiend in human shape, Bai Gunan, were to cause trouble, he would even disregard his bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You’re talking to me?” Senior Sister Wen gritted her teeth, and her eyes were on the verge of spraying flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who else?! Would I be talking to a ghost if not you?” Bai Gunan spoke with a vicious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know who I am? You dare speak like this to me?” Senior Sister Wen took a deep breath and was barely able to suppress the flames of rage in her heart while she spoke with a livid expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t it just the Heavenly Insight Palace?” Bai Gunan spat on the ground. “Little girl, remember that you can’t represent your sect. Not to mention that if someone dares to offend this Young Master, then even an emperor has to obediently admit his mistakes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai Gunan, you’re going too far!” Yan Shisan was finally unable to continue watching, and he stood up slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, he seemed as if he’d become another person. His long hair fluttered while his imposing figure surged with monstrous battle intent, and he was like a scorching sun that was unrestrained, arrogant, and peerlessly overbearing. His eyes erupted with strands of blazing flaming glows that interweaved together and formed layer after layer of profound phenomena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere at the scene instantly became heavy to the point it was almost suffocating, and the air carried a wisp of killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter if it was Senior Sister Wen or the other young women, all of their faces eased up when they saw Yan Shisan standing up in support for them, and their beautiful faces revealed a wisp of complacency and cold smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shisan’s combat strength was renowned amongst all those of the same cultivation throughout the Dark Reverie, and he was almost invincible. Most importantly, he had the nickname of being a madman because he wouldn’t even recognize his own kin while in battle. So wasn’t this profligate disciple of the Bai Clan, Bai Gunan, nothing more than a paper tiger before him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, they noticed Bai Gunan’s eyes focused abruptly when he saw Yan Shisan stand up, and a trace of a heavy expression appeared on his face. This caused all of them to feel even more relaxed, and their gazes towards Bai Gunan revealed a wisp of unconcealed disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, everyone in the hall felt excited upon seeing this scene.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ferocious figure, Yan Shisan, has finally made a move, so what sort of collision would occur between this arrogant and overbearing profligate disciple and a great madman that’s lusts madly for battle?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was filed with anticipation, and they felt their trip to the Immortal Indulgence Inn this time was worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan Shisan, others might be afraid of you, but this Young Master isn’t. Don’t forget that you were almost killed by my Brother Chen Xi at the Dark Parasol Secret Realm, and how could you still be alive if it wasn’t for you relying on a Cosmic Immortal Talisman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To everyone’s astonishment, Bai Gunan’s expression quickly returned to normal, and there was even deep disdain on his face as he faced Yan Shisan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, don’t hit a man on his face, and don’t hit a man where it hurts. Bai Gunan’s actions of speaking about this matter in front of so many people was simply like smearing salt on his wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the hall had heard of this matter before. After all, everything that had occurred in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss was truly too shocking, and it was precisely from that time onward that Chen Xi’s name had spread throughout the entire Dark Reverie like the sun in the midday sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though a few months had already passed now, the string of shocking events that occurred in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss was still the hottest topic all around the Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The topic everyone took the most delight in talking about was the battle between Chen Xi and Yan Shisan because it could be considered to be a greatest battle amongst those of the same cultivation realm in the recent years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peerless genius Yan Shisan lost and almost perished, and it caused the entire cultivation world to be shocked, whereas, the other party to the battle, Chen Xi, was given numerous dazzling honors by everyone, causing his name to be spread throughout the world and be known well by all the various powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So when Bai Gunan mentioned this matter in public, everyone understood that he was intentionally slapping Yan Shisan’s face without disguising it in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, Yan Shisan’s expression instantly darkened as he said indifferently, “The winners are always in the right. I’m living fine and well now, but Chen Xi might not. According to my knowledge, he’s already perished in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, and even if he didn’t die and is still alive, his cultivation has surely been crippled and has been reduced to become an ordinary person!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, the hall instantly became perfectly silent as the faces of everyone was filled with shock, and they sat there like clay statues while filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Chen Xi entered in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss and hadn’t appeared in the cultivation world for so long, many people felt that he’d perished within it, but no one dared to say it with certainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yan Shisan had actually said that Chen Xi would have either died or been reduced to an ordinary person. Moreover, his tone seemed absolutely not like he was joking. So how could this not shock everyone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure?” Amidst this silent atmosphere, an indifferent voice resounded out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course!” Yan Shisan replied without the slightest hesitation because how could the information Lord Bing Shitian gave him be fake?</span></p>

After that, he saw a figure that in his opinion should have died a long time ago — Chen Xi!</span></p>

He’d lost all his composure and instead seemed to revealed surprise and bewilderment that couldn’t be concealed.</span></p>

He doesn’t have status nor position, so what’s there to make a fuss about?</span></p>

Others didn’t know, but he knew very clearly that it was precisely Lord Bing Shitian who’d made a move in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss to kill Chen Xi, yet never had he imagined that Chen Xi would actually appear unharmed before him!</span></p>

Even though they hadn’t seen Chen Xi yet had heard some rumors, and those rumors said that Chen Xi was a handsome and extraordinary young man!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that Brother Yan hoped I died?” Chen Xi said indifferently, “Unfortunately, even though Bing Shitian made a move in the Dark Parasol’s Abyss that day, he wasn’t able to kill me in the end.”</span></p>

They didn’t dare believe that this fellow who was with a group of vulgar barbarians would actually be the most renowned and outstanding disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, Chen Xi!</span></p>

His resolute and decisive actions, and his exceedingly swift movement technique caused most of the people present to almost be unable to react to what had happened.</span></p>

He grabbed out with his hand, causing talisman markings to surge, swiftly spread out, and envelop the surroundings. “Do you think I’d let you escape again this time? Leave your life behind!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
