 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What!? All of them are dead!?” The expression of the grey clothed old man called Ling Ya darkened as he roared furiously, and he was like a sun that erupted and emitted extremely dazzling brilliance that shook everyone present to the point their bodies trembled and shuddered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancestor Ling Ya’s expression was livid while his aura was violent like a ferocious and terrifying primitive beast. In the next moment, his pair of hawk eyes erupted with piercingly cold bolts of lightning that swept towards Chen Xi and the others like sharp swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi, Qing Xiuyi, and Zhen Liuqing were suffocated, and they felt an extremely terrifying pressure that pressed down onto them to the point even their blood seemed to have been frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They felt like ants on the ground facing a hawk that soared in the sky, tiny and powerless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi was unable to see through exactly what level in the Earthly Immortal Realm this Ancestor Ling Ya was at, Chen Xi knew he was extremely formidable just from the might he emitted. Even if Chen Xi utilized all his ability, it would be impossible for Chen Xi to be a match for the old man, and he didn’t have the slightest confidence of victory when facing such a figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was a cultivator, the other an immortal!</span></p>

His cultivation and realm were utterly not on the same level as Chen Xi, and one could obviously know the difference between an Earthly Immortal and cultivator just from the might he emitted that could cause the heavens and the earth to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an Earthly Immortal Realm expert that possessed a formidable strength that was sufficient to allow him to stand proudly at the peak of the cultivation world while looking down upon all with monstrous might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi had once seen numerous Earthly Immortal Realm experts, he hadn’t gone head on against them after all. Presently, being stared at coldly by Ancestor Ling Ya instantly caused him to clearly notice the gap between him and an Earthly Immortal, and it was simply like the gap between the heavens and the earth, impossible to surmount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s only a little fellow at the initial-stage of the Rebirth Realm and two little girls at the 4<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm. How could they possibly annihilate so many of you? You wouldn’t be deceiving me, right?” Ancestor Ling Ya spoke coldly, and his gaze moved to look at the nearby Shang Que.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ancestor! Every word I spoke is the truth, and I absolutely don’t dare to deceive you. That Chen Xi looks to only possess a cultivation at the initial-stage of the Rebirth Realm, yet he has overcome the Phoenix Tribulation of Rebirth and possesses the potential of an exalted figure. Moreover, he has already become the number one ranked figure on the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet!” Ancestor Ling Ya’s stare caused Shang Que to tremble and feel as if his soul was about to leave his body, and he hurriedly explained. “On the other hand, one of those two young women is a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal that has mastered the Grand Dao of Light, whereas the other possesses a Primeval Watersoul Body and has mastered the Grand Dao of Darkness. Moreover, they’d comprehended the Grand Dao of Tai Chi, causing their strengths to similarly be formidable to the extreme!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancestor Ling Ya was stunned when he heard this, and then a ball of divine light erupted from within his eyes as he suddenly started sizing up Chen Xi and the others once more. His gaze was oppressive and suffused with a strange glow that caused it to seem as if any secrets were incapable of escaping his discerning gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the white haired and handsome young man by his side sized up the three open with interest. Especially when he looked at Qing Xiuyi, there was actually a trace of an imperceptible and strange sheen that suffused his eyes that seemed to have experienced countless years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, what Chen Xi and the others felt was completely different. The oppressive pressure from being stared at by the gaze of two Earthly Immortals was like an enormous mountain pressing down onto their hearts, and it caused their expressions to be extremely heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of the distant spectators became complicated when they saw this, and they felt the luck of Chen Xi and the others was too misfortunate. They’d just escaped danger, yet encountered the arrival of the emissaries from the Dark Reverie, and there was even an Ancestor of the Shang Clan present amongst them, so they would be unable to escape calamity this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though there was rarely any example of emissaries annihilating the disciples of Dynasties in the Primeval Battlefield, no one could guarantee that this wouldn’t happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially when the members of the Shang Clan had almost been completely wiped out already. When facing such a tragic scene, it was impossible to guarantee that Ancestor Ling Ya wouldn’t disregard everything and launch an attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancestor Ling Ya’s gaunt face was completely livid as he’d already believed Shang Que’s words, but it was precisely this that aroused the killing intent in his heart to the point of boiling even more and causing him to be unable to restrain his rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was from a great power in the Dark Reverie, the Heartcontrol Swordhouse, and he represented the sect to select disciples in the Primeval Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But similarly, he was also a member of the Shang Clan. A thousand years ago, he’d once entered the Primeval Battlefield to gain experience and tempering, and he was fortunate enough to enter the Dark Reverie’s Heartcontrol Swordhouse and be able to attain his current accomplishments. However, even though he was in the Heartcontrol Swordhouse, he never forgot that he was a member of the Shang Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he was able to become an emissary and arrive at the Primeval Battlefield this time, he was originally hoping to recruit all the disciples of his clan into the Heartcontrol Swordhouse and allow them to enjoy the best treatment while under his protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had he imagined that besides Shang Que, all the other juniors of his had actually been annihilated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When faced with this blood and brutal scene, it was obvious how furious Ling Ya was in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I must kill these three vile demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent flashed in Ling Ya’s eyes as his figure suddenly shot out explosively, and his right hand stretched out to claw towards Chen Xi and the others from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the area Chen Xi and the others were at started to collapse and be compressed as the space in the surroundings was squeezed and crushed into an enormous black hole that seemed like a bloody hole that had suddenly appeared in the sky, and it intended to swallow and devour Chen Xi and the others up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was simply like an attack of the gods. A simple claw covered the surroundings and collapsed space, and it contained an otherworldly aura. Not to mention Chen Xi’s group of three, even a Nether Transformation Realm expert would be unable to see through the profundities contained within this attack, let alone resist and struggle against it because the cultivator wouldn’t even have the chance to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the ability of an Earthly Immortal Realm expert that had already started to grasp the laws of the heavens and the earth. Every single move of theirs seemed simple yet contained boundless profundities accompanying them, and only experts of the same realm were capable of seeing through its profundity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The facts were indeed like this. Even though Chen Xi and the others had taken great precautions and were prepared for battle, they had a powerless feeling of being unable to escape or resist when facing the strength of this claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked as they never expected that Ling Ya would actually make a move abruptly while disregarding his bearing and dignity. Moreover, he intended to kill Chen Xi and the others with this strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que was overjoyed instead, and he was excited and delighted to the point of wishing for nothing more than to howl into the sky. He’d been trampled on too ruthlessly by Chen Xi, causing him to have a bellyful of resentment and hatred yet nowhere to vent it. At this moment, when he saw his clan’s Ancestor making a move, the excitement in his heart was indescribable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Ling Ya, isn’t it slightly bad for you to bully the young!?” However, right at this moment, a warm and clear voice resounded out, and along with this voice, the entire heavens and the earth seemed to have instantly become quiet. The violent winds, chaotic flow of air, shattered space, howling True Essence…everything had become silent and unmoving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the collapsed space that was like a bloody mouth had instantly returned to normal, and it seemed as if the terrifying scene from before was only an illusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Commanding techniques with a thought!</span></p>

This ability that was almost godly caused everyone present to be dumbstruck and feel disbelief.</span></p>

But they couldn’t help but be bewildered when they looked at the figure that stood by their side.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why would this person lend us a hand?

Why did you stop me!?” Ling Ya’s gaunt face couldn’t help but turn grim when he saw his fatal attack was blocked, and he spoke out with an icy cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Ling Ya, as an emissary of the Dark Reverie, you ought to understand the rules after entering the Primeval Battlefield. Could it be that you want to challenge the rules set by the numerous powers by acting in this way?” The white haired and handsome young man spoke indifferently and with a graceful bearing that could win over the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Preposterous!” A cold light appeared abruptly in Ling Ya’s eyes. “These three people have cruelly killed so many disciples of my Shang Clan with ruthless and brutal methods. Could it be that they shouldn’t suffer punishment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was a matter between juniors, and they deserve to die for possessing inferior ability. This is the rules of the Primeval Battlefield that no one can go against. Could it be that you can willfully break the rules just because those that died were the disciples of your Shang Clan?” Yun Lansheng’s snow white hair fluttered as he spoke with an indifferent voice that revealed a tone that didn’t tolerate defiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rules are set by men, move out of the way! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!” Ling Ya’s expression was gloomy as he shouted explosively. The aura surrounding his body rumbled as it linked up with the heavens and the earth, causing an extremely terrifying and oppressive aura to gush out, and it seemed as if he’d already become the ruler of this expanse of the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure you want to go against me?” Yun Lansheng raised his head. His pair of experienced eyes were suffused with a horrifying glow of lightning while his snow white hair and clothes fluttered, and his aura shook the surroundings.</span></p>

Why’re you only siding with them? Could it be that you aren’t afraid of drawing the rage of my Heartcontrol Swordhouse from acting in this way?” The expression in Ling Ya’s gaze changed indeterminately as he roared, and his aura weakened greatly. Obviously, he was slightly afraid of the strength of this handsome young man as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no harm in telling you.” Yun Lansheng went silent for a long time before pointing at the nearby Qing Xiuyi, and his voice was actually suffused with a trace of sorrow. “Do you know what her name is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ya was stunned and said with displeasure, “It’s just the name of a little girl, what does it have to do with me?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ya’s eyes squinted as he looked at Qing Xiuyi and cried out involuntarily. “Could it be that it was her?”</span></p>
