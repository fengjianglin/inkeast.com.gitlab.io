The scene at this moment seemed like the scene of an immortal paradise, and it didn’t reveal the slightest bit of a terrifying and ghastly scene like before.</span></p>

In this Ghost Wasteland, within the ruined temple and under the rainstorm, his vital energy had fused with the heavens and the earth, and he’d finally grasped the trace of opportunity to advance, causing his entire body to undergo a qualitative transformation from inside out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

It seemed like the first bolt of lightning that tore through the heavens and the earth, the extremely ancient sword of the Dao that slashed apart the chaos, and it slashed down within his Dantian.</span></p>

The end of the bridge was originally covered in an expanse of chaos yet it suddenly split into two, and the clear qi rose to transform into the sky while the muddy qi sank to transform into the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extremely simple shape of a world was formed just like this!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the chaos was split open at the beginning, it was like shackles that had been broken. Yin and Yang were separated, the heaven was Yang while the earth was Yin, and between this Yin and Yang was the boundless world…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boundless tiny pieces of comprehension surged successively into Chen Xi’s heart. In the next moment, the Rebirth Wheel within his Dantian exploded abruptly and transformed into a ball of multicolored bright light that gushed into the simple world before transforming into landscapes and plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five elements replace each other and circulate endlessly as it developed everything within the world…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely the time for a few breaths, the entire world had a gorgeous, colorful, and magnificent aura, and it was overflowing with vitality as everything in the world was being created, causing it to not be grey and dull anymore.</span></p>

The heavens and the earth were divided into night and day while thunder surged and creation of everything started showing the transition between life and death… The entire world had ‘moved’ abruptly, and its movement created an upward thriving momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yin, Yang, the five elements, star, lightning, wind, sky… All the Grand Dao profundities Chen Xi had grasped formed this independent space within the Blackhole in his body. Besides lacking the Supreme Laws of the Heaven Dao like the Spatial Law, the Temporal Law, the Law of Life and Death, and so on and so forth, it could already compare with a real world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

Every single time it circulated, its essence would undergo a shocking transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His True Essence became vast, crystalline, and suffused with a jade like sheen.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His entire body seemed to have fused with the heavens, the earth, and everything in the world. His body reflected the heavens and the earth from the outside while the soul connected the body from within, and his entire body conformed with the Heaven Dao, causing him to seem like a celestial being that had descended into the mortal world and seemed as if he would fly away at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi had finally stepped into the Nether Transformation Realm and developed his Blackhole World, and he’d attained the Nether Transformation Realm that all cultivators dreamt of obtaining. Every single move he made was already capable of drawing on the energy of the heavens and the earth, and he was truly capable of collapsing a mountain and splitting the earth with a flick of his finger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was said that the True Essence within Chen Xi’s body was a stream before, then it was a surging river that roiled endlessly now. Since a world had been formed in his body, how much True Essence could it hold? It absolutely surpassed the amount he was previously capable of holding by more than 100 times!</span></p>

Unlike the other Grand Dao profundities, it obviously had a color that belonged to the six paths of reincarnation of the Netherworld.</span></p>
