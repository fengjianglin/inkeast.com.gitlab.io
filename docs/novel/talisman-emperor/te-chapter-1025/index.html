Don’t be so ignorant when you’re reincarnated in your next lifetime!” Xiong Ming roared with laughter while a ruthless expression flashed on his face, and then the Immortal Force in his entire body circulated as he intended to seize this opportunity to crush Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at this critical moment, Chen Xi was still calm and unfazed. The surging battle intent in his eyes were completely replaced by an expression that was icy cold, merciless, and murderous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

Powerful might rumbled throughout his body like a tide, and his entire body emanated boundless bright light while the Talisman Armament in his hand slashed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strike was condensed, heavy, and like a lofty mountain that lay across the heavens and the earth. It possessed an imposing aura of holding down the world, and it was the aura of the Laws of Earth.</span></p>

But when this sword strike was executed, a wave of strange rumbling suddenly resounded in space.</span></p>

It was even to the extent that the first strand of sword qi Chen Xi executed, the sword qi that contained the Laws of Wood, which was in the depths of the myriad of verdant vines had started to recover to its former state as well…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, the dazzling and resplendent energy of the Laws of Fire, Metal, Water, Wood, and Earth were carried within the strands of sword qi as they shot through the sky and transformed into the five elements that acted in coordination with each other and circulated from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five strands of sword qi hung high above in the sky and formed a circulation!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bodies of everyone that stood in the surroundings stiffened when they saw this scene, and they lost control of their states of mind while their eyes were filled with boundless shock. It was as if they were witnessing the birth of a dazzling miracle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Wei Zheng and the others froze. They asked themselves and knew that if this strike were to be directed at them, then they would die no matter how they resisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” Xiong Ming’s heart shook while his confident and arrogant expression froze. For the first time, he felt the aura of a lethal threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” It was at this moment that Chen Xi’s gaze became icy cold like a blade as he lightly spat out a single word, and it was like the decree of a god. At that instant, the five extraordinary strands of sword qi circulated as they transformed into a gorgeous screen of light that was formed from sword qi, and it completely enveloped Xiong Ming along with his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

The brilliant sword qi that were woven with the Laws of the five elements easily minced the myriad of vines into pieces, causing pieces of vines to fill the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were like five heaven ploughing blades, and nothing could stand in the way of these blades!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiong Ming’s expression was instantly replaced with a wisp of terror and shock. He was obviously unable to imagine that even his strongest attack would actually be unable to resist the sword qi Chen Xi executed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Laws of the five elements forming a circulation! Dammit! How could his cultivation at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm possibly support such an enormous force? How…how…how could this be possible?” After he noticed all of this, Xiong Ming roared with disbelief. Even he who was a Mysterious Immortal had only grasped a single Law to perfection, the Law of Wood. But the tiny ant before him that had just ascended to the Immortal Dimension for a mere two days had actually completely condensed the Grand Daos of the five elements into perfect Laws of the five elements. Moreover, it had even formed a phenomenon caused by the circulation of the five elements. How could he maintain his calm before this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that as far as he was concerned, it was utterly impossible to execute such an attack with the Immortal Force possessed at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how much disbelief filled his heart, the might of the five extraordinary strands of sword qi that smashed down from the sky grew more and more terrifying, and it shook the Second-Wood Azuresoul Bell to the point of shaking violently, causing it to suffer a heavy injury and be on the verge of being impossible to sustain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could an ant like you possibly defeat me?” Xiong Ming’s expression was livid and grim while his eyes were bloodshot. An opponent that he originally thought to be easy prey actually showed signs of suppressing him at this moment, and it was truly impossible to endure for a Mysterious Immortal like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! You must die today!” Xiong Ming roared angrily like a furious ferocious beast, and he grasped the Second-Wood Azuresoul Bell before slapping it repeatedly, causing circle after circle of seemingly material verdant soundwaves to erupt from it. Obviously, he intended to fight desperately with his life on the line!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression was indifferent towards this, and he remained steady and without moving. Only the Talisman Armament howled as it controlled the sword qi of the five elements from afar and crushed down fiercely on Xiong Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

In the end, it was unable to withstand the might of the sword qi, and it was blasted flying with a bang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Xiong Ming’s entire body had completely lost its defense, causing his expression to swiftly turn pale. He was just intending to dodge yet it was already too late, and his robust figure was directly enveloped within the five element sword veil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could this be possible!? How could an any at the initial-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm defeat me?! No!!!” Xiong Ming’s terrified, furious, and frustrated howl rumbled out from within the five element sword veil, yet no matter how he struggled, he was actually unable to struggle free from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

After that, under the focused view of numerous astounded gazes, a scarlet red wave of blood shot out in midair and dyed the sky red!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Immortal Xiong Ming had fallen!</span></p>

They truly didn’t dare believe that Lord Xiong Ming who possessed a cultivation at the initial-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm would actually lose at the hands of an ascender that had just ascended into the Immortal Dimension two days ago…</span></p>

If news of this were to spread, then it would probably cause a great commotion in the Immortal Dimension, right?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Wei Zheng and the others turned grim as they recovered from their shock, and they understood the situation they were in.</span></p>

Do you think you’ve won? If I’m not wrong, then the battle from before has already completely exhausted your strength. You’re only an empty frame now!” Wei Zheng gritted his teeth and berated in a grim voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he said all of this, he didn’t dare make a move rashly because he’d been overwhelmed with terror from the scene that occurred moment before.</span></p>

No matter how heaven defying your combat strength is, your cultivation is too weak in the end. At this moment, you’re obviously putting on a show because if you had the ability to kill us, then would you waste your breath?” The nearby Lou Feng spoke in a ghastly tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, both of them said this to probe Chen Xi, and they would instantly flee for their lives if they sensed anything wasn’t right. Of course, if it was as they’d expected, then they would absolutely not let go of this superb opportunity to annihilate Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Kun didn’t say anything, yet his eyes lit up while the gaze he shot at Chen Xi already carried a wisp of ruthlessness. Obviously, he felt that Chen Xi’s strength was completely exhausted as well, and it was impossible for Chen Xi to sustain himself in battle any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged when facing this, and he just stared at the three of them with icy cold gazes as if he was staring at three corpses.</span></p>

His battle with Xiong Ming had completely exhausted the Immortal Force within his body. But they had utterly not imagined that with the Dark Parasol Sapling, it wouldn’t take long before he would be able to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there was obviously doubt in their hearts. But because they were deterred from the might Chen Xi revealed when he killed Xiong Ming, they would absolutely not dare to rashly make a move at this moment, and this was precisely Chen Xi’s opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the development of the situation had caused Chen Xi to be bound to not have to make another move.</span></p>

Fellow Daoist Chen Xi has already helped us deal with the greatest problem. Now, it’s time for us to make an effort as well!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them were great figures in the Mortal Dimension, and they originally thought they could freely cultivate upon arriving at the Immortal Dimension. Never had they imagined that they would be captured and reduced to slaves in a mine as soon as they arrived in the Immortal Dimension. Moreover, they became slaves that didn’t dare flare up no matter how they were cursed at or put to work, and they’d accumulated a belly full of rage since a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, when they saw Wei Zheng and the others had lost their greatest reliance, how could all these ascenders restrain themselves?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even mu Linglong gritted her white teeth as she charged forward. Even though she didn’t know how to fight, the Spiritvoid Illusion God Steps she possessed were peerlessly miraculous to the point that even Chen Xi exclaimed endlessly with admiration towards it. As soon as she moved forward, she completely sealed off Wei Zheng’s groups paths of retreat, yet she only trapped them and didn’t attack, and this won an opportunity for those ascenders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How dare all of you!”&nbsp;</span></p>

Unfortunately, they were quickly drowned by those ascenders and frequently let out miserable shrill cries.</span></p>

There was an entire sixty plus of them, and all of them were ferocious figures that had fought their way through the Mortal Dimension, causing every single one of them to possess abundant combat expression. Wei Zheng and the others were utterly unable to resist their joint forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with Xiong Ming’s death having crushed Wei Zheng, Lou Feng, and Xue Kun’s will to fight and Chen Xi glaring fiercely at them like a tiger from the side, the three of them were bound to lose.</span></p>

In the next moment, he started to sort the spoils of the battle.</span></p>

Most importantly, it was also extremely important to Chen Xi who’d just arrived at the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
