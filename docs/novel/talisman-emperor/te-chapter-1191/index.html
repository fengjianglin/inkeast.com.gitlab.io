 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vastcloud Mountain, the Emperor Grade Abode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Xi returned here, he was still thinking about his gains from today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, he’d restored the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron successfully and obtained a strand of the Karmic Luck of the Heaven Dao, and he gained 800,000 Starpoints from this as well. Coupled with the 160,000 Starpoints he possessed, he already possessed 960,000 Starpoints!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he obtained Hua Jiankong’s Starclasp Immortal Sword that was an extreme-rank Cosmic Grade Immortal Artifact. Of course, Chen Xi was very well aware that it was extremely difficult for him to bring forth the entire might of this sword with his current cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even then, merely based on its might, it was probably even more superior than the Talisman Armament. It just depended on how it was used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides that, he obtained the wings of a Nether Crane, Roc, and Suncrow; and he obtained the Woodsoul Flame, Darkwater Flame, Sunflame, and Stalactite Flames that were top flames in the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, he only lacked the wings of a Phoenix to start refining the Flame God Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, according to what those seniors had said, it wasn’t so easy to obtain the wings of a Phoenix. However, Chen Xi wasn’t in a hurry, and he couldn’t afford to be in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obtaining a treasure like this that could only be chanced upon by luck depended entirely upon fate and fortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Chen Xi obtained a bottle of Nine Aperture Clarity Divine Pills. There was a total of eighteen pills within the bottle, and every single one of them was worth a fortune. They were supreme treasures amongst pills and were extremely rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, these were pills that were personally refined by the Nine Profundity Treasured Cauldron. They were unique in the heavens and the earth, and they were so valuable that it was absolutely unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the gains of those seniors, Chen Xi’s overall gains weren’t much inferior to them, and it might even surpass them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the thing that Chen Xi attached importance to wasn’t all of this. As far as he was concerned, the greatest gains he obtained this time in the Pill Reserve was the friendship formed with all of those seniors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the most precious gain he obtained!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter if it was those seniors of the Pill Reserve, the great figures of the Xuanyuan Clan, the Head Enforcer Li Bei and the others, or even Hua Jiankong, all of them were existences with high status and powerful authority in the academy. So the benefits from establishing a friendship with them was absolutely greater than obtaining some treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was very well aware of this because it was absolutely impossible for him to rely on himself to go against the Zuoqiu Clan. He could only accomplish it by establishing a force of his own and drawing in even more assistance!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I earned almost a million Starpoints within a little over ten days. It seems to be an extremely great amount, but if it continues according to this speed, then I wonder when I’ll be able to gather over a hundred million Starpoints…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there’s nothing else to do, then my clone should place emphasis on earning Starpoints until the inner court exam begins. As for my main body, with the Nine Aperture Clarity Divine Pills and the world of stars, two years are sufficient for me to advance into the Golden Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, my cultivation has just broken through into the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm now, so it’s better for me to temper my foundation and solidify my cultivation in the near future. I can seize this opportunity to head to the world of stars and comprehend another inheritance from the Infinite Divine Talisman…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the abode, the tiny cauldron was still absorbing Primeval Chaotic Qi while Chen Xi was swiftly planning his next step in his mind. His objective for doing all of this was naturally for the sake of making the best use of every single second of his time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he really didn’t have much time left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short period of time, Chen Xi stood up and was about to enter the world of stars when the tiny cauldron suddenly stopped him. “Where did you get the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form that your clone cultivates?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned and didn’t know why the tiny cauldron asked about this. But he still explained the origins of the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cloudray City, a teacher of Four Divinity Academy? Looks like he obtained that damaged jade talisman by chance. Could it be that it’s the will of the heavens for it to fall into your possession?” The tiny cauldron pondered deeply, and its words revealed a strand of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi couldn’t help but ask. “Senior, could it be that there’s something wrong with this cultivation technique?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tiny cauldron went silent and said after a short while, “You ought to be clearly aware that this cultivation technique was passed down since the primeval times from a Fiendgod that was born from the chaos. But do you know who that Fiendgod was?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi shook his head. How could be aware of this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Fiendgods sought to gain supremacy of the world since the primeval times. In terms of natural talent, Divine Abilities, and might, there was no one in the three dimensions who could compare to them. Amongst the Fiendgods, the most renowned was definitely the Pangu Clan.” The tiny cauldron spoke about some secrets from the primeval times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Pangu Clan split open the world and attained great accomplishments. He transformed the chaotic Heaven Dao into the numerous worlds of the three dimensions, and he was the number one figure in the primeval times. Only he alone was qualified to be named Pangu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Later on, twelve Ancestral Shamans attained the Dao and worshipped Pangu as their Ancestor. All of them possessed peerlessly formidable bodies that were capable of devouring the world and controlling the elements. They could move mountains, fill seas, and change the entire landscape. They were the twelve strongest Fiendgods amongst the Fiendgod Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The primeval times were filled with desolation. Even though there were numerous gods and extraordinary sages at that time, their overall strength was unable to go against the Fiendgod Clan. So at that time, it was said that the Fiendgods reigned supreme amongst all the myriad of living beings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It could be said that the primeval times belonged to the Fiendgods. Even the ancient clans like the Suiren Clan, Youchao Clan, Nuwa Clan, Shennong Clan were mostly closely related to the Fiendgod Clan.” <span id="footnote-ref-3c91"><a href="#footnote-3c91">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On the other hand, the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form is an inheritance that came from the Fiendgod Clan. Its exact origins can’t be determined, but it was so renowned that it was known to all during the primeval times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Some legends say that this technique came from within the chaos and belonged to Pangu. Some legends say that this technique was jointly created by the twelve Ancestral Shamans. It can be said that there are various different accounts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was precisely because of its unfathomable origins that the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form became one of the most renowned cultivation techniques in the Fiendgod Clan. Unfortunately, along with the decline and annihilation of the Fiendgod Clan, this technique had been obliterated in the annals of time, and it’s extremely rare to see in the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it spoke up to here, the tiny cauldron went silent for a moment before it continued. “In short, the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form isn’t necessarily the strongest of existences that cultivate in the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement, but it’s the most orthodox and supreme body refinement inheritance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was shocked. He’d never imagined that the body refinement technique he obtained by chance would actually possess such a shocking background that involved numerous legends and secrets of the primeval times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, in this way, isn’t the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form extremely difficult to cultivate?” Chen Xi frowned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed, and it isn’t just difficult. However, it isn’t necessarily impossible to cultivate.” The tiny cauldron spoke with a voice that actually carried a strange tone. “Do you know what cultivation technique I cultivate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned, and this a wisp of shock suddenly flashed in his eyes as he said with astonishment, “It wouldn’t be the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly.” The tiny cauldron didn’t keep him guessing and answered in an extremely frank manner. “Without the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form, it would be absolutely impossible for me to escape the various tribulations I faced in the countless years of the past and survive until now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was utterly speechless. He’d already been rather curious towards the tiny cauldron’s background and the path of cultivation it took since a long time ago, yet he never ever expected that he would actually cultivate the same cultivation technique as the tiny cauldron one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the cultivation technique he cultivated wasn’t obtained from the tiny cauldron!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the will of the heavens, and it’s impossible to figure out. I originally didn’t intend to taint you with my karma, yet never had I expected that it would be impossible to avoid forming a link between us.” The tiny cauldron sighed with a voice that carried a wisp of ridicule. It seemed to be ridiculing itself and laughing at how the will of the heavens played tricks on people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Chen Xi fell in to silence as well. After an unknown period of time, he said, “Senior, perhaps fate is controlled by the will of the heavens, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His expression became serious, firm, and revealed a wisp of an indescribably sharp and confident aura. “In my opinion, the path of cultivation places emphasis on the heart. Karma, fate, destiny may restrain my footsteps, yet it’s unable to obstruct my heart that seeks the Dao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the heavens obstruct me, then I’ll break it open!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the earth restrains me, then I’ll destroy it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the Dao Heart remains strong, then who cares if the will of the heavens plays tricks on others?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single word he spoke was resolute, and it vividly displayed his firm and extraordinary heart that sought the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All along his path until now, he’d fought the heavens, fought the earth, and fought himself, yet he’d never become dejected, so he naturally wasn’t afraid of karma or fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tiny cauldron went silent for a long time upon hearing this before it said with an extremely complicated tone, “The ignorant are fearless? Or perhaps, the reason I’ve fallen to such a state is because I’ve really been too stubborn towards the matters of karma…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was silent. He felt he didn’t have the qualification to guide the tiny cauldron and advise it on what it should do. Instead of saying those words he spoke earlier were spoken to the tiny cauldron, it could be said that it was a form of self-conviction towards his own Dao Heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form isn’t cultivated like that. If you’ve really decided to cultivate this technique with your clone, then I can guide you with my experience.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But in this way, our karma will be intertwined. My tribulations will be the cause of your ruin. You must think through it clearly before answering me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even until the moment Chen Xi entered the world of stars, the last words the tiny cauldron spoke to him still reverberated in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Our karma will be intertwined?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A carefully concealed smile appeared on the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth, and he muttered. “Is there any need to consider? If a tribulation descended onto you in the future, then how could I possible watch indifferently from the side?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you’re talking about karma being intertwined, then weren’t ours bound together since the moment I met you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi took a deep breath and discarded the distracting thoughts in his mind before he stopped thinking about all of this. He’d decided in his heart that once he passed the inner court exam two years from now, he would make his clone cultivate the Nethergod Nine Cauldron Form with the tiny cauldron!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, Chen Xi didn’t waste any more time and directly entered the world of stars’ inheritance ground. He arrived within the mysterious space and once more saw the Infinite Divine Talisman that emanated a mysterious aura within the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve already comprehended all the profundities of the Sword of Water now. Next, I’ll start studying the Laws of Fire…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi stared at the Infinite Divine Talisman while he’d already decided in his heart a long time ago. He would first cultivate the inheritance of the five elements before he comprehended the inheritances of the other laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, even though the Laws of the five elements seemed to be ordinary, they were the foundation of the three dimensions and maintained the stability and changes in the three dimensions. So he naturally had to cultivate the inheritance of the Infinite Divine Talisman from the foundation before rising step by step. It was a process of advancing steadily from the easiest to the most complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s entire body surged with strands of the Law of Fire. It was like fireworks erupting beneath the starry sky, and it formed a distant connection with the Infinite Divine Talisman that was in the darkness.</span></p>
