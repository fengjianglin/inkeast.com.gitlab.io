 <p>Chapter 177 – Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat</p>
 <p>A Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat was the product of the mating between the primordial variant beast, Six-Winged Blood Bat, and the divine beast Blood Dragon. It possessed the bloodline of two primordial demon beasts, causing its strength to be terrifying, and it was extremely savage, bloodthirsty, and brutal.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was able to discern with a glance that although the aura emitted by this Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat before him was inferior to a Rebirth Realm cultivator, it far surpassed an ordinary Golden Core Realm cultivator!</p>
 <p>This terrifying strength, coupled with its innately powerful body and movement technique that was swift like the wind, made it so that even Rebirth Realm cultivators were probably unable to do anything against it.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi acknowledged that if he were to face an opponent like this, he could only flee.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Bai Kui was hiding beneath the blood colored mountain and wasn’t noticed by the ferocious Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat, causing Chen Xi to heave a long sigh of relief.</p>
 <p><i>But, why is this little fellow hiding here?</i></p>
 <p>“Chen Xi, this vile beast is about to take human form!” Right when Chen Xi was bewildered, Ling Bai excitedly sent him a swift voice transmission. “What a good opportunity! The instant it transforms is the instant its strength is the weakest. If we make a move, we’ll surely be able to annihilate it. After we extract its Inner Core and you consume it, you’ll surely be able to break through to the Golden Hall Realm in one go!”</p>
 <p><i>It’s transforming! </i>Chen Xi was instantly shocked.</p>
 <p>Once this Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat transformed, it would be able to advance to the Rebirth Realm in one go and become a Rebirth Realm demon cultivator. Moreover, the True Essence it possessed would be much more than humans, and it was even to the extent that it was 10 or 20 times more than a human cultivator!</p>
 <p>Because the body of the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat was much stronger than a human, once it took human form, its True Essence would naturally be much denser.</p>
 <p>After taking human form, an ordinary demon beast’s True Essence was far from being as terrifying as the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat.</p>
 <p>But it was extremely difficult for a Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat to take human form. Because of the two types of primordial bloodlines running within its veins, unless it attained a cultivation around the Rebirth Realm or consumed some precious spirit medicines, it would be utterly impossible for it to take human form.</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi, this is a great opportunity that only occurs once in a blue moon. A primordial variant demon beast like this is extremely rare, and this vile beast is probably the overlord of this area of the forest. If it was ordinary times, we’d surely have to go around it. But now, it’s about to overcome its tribulation to take human form, and its strength will become exceedingly weak. We must seize this opportunity to hunt and kill it!” Ling Bai started to make noise once again, and he looked to be extremely covetous.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Chen Xi slowly nodded. <i>Indeed, the benefits of killing this Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat is extremely great. Moreover, not to mention its Inner Core, even its bones, wings, and fangs are equipment refinement treasures that are difficult to come by, and their value is shocking!</i></p>
 <p>Woo! Wuu! Woo!</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, on the blood colored mountain, the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat abruptly howled into the sky, and the six pairs of blood colored wings unfolded on its back. Boundless energy formed into vortexes as its sharp cry sounded out along with the wind, and it caused a chill to run down one’s spine.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the originally clear sky became pitch black like ink, and there were even traces of lightning arcs flowing within the dark clouds as if it was accumulating energy.</p>
 <p>This Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat had drawn the Heavenly Tribulation and had started to rely on the energy of the Heavenly Tribulation to take human form!</p>
 <p>It was the first time that Chen Xi saw a demon beast take human form, and it was even a colossus like the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat, a primordial variant.</p>
 <p>Even from extremely far away, the waves of vast demonic qi and sanguinary aura caused one to feel a wave of fear, and accompanied by the long howl of the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat, the heaven and earth instantly fell into a state of whistling storms and raging hurricanes as terrifying cries filled the sky. If a hunter were to pass by at this time, he would probably be terrified to death!</p>
 <p>Before a creature developed intelligence, it could only be called a wild animal, and only by developing intelligence and understanding how to absorb the spirit energy of heaven and earth to accumulate True Essence would it become a demon beast, a full-fledged demon!</p>
 <p>Wild animal and demon beast, two different levels, and it was like ordinary people and cultivators, a difference like that between heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Cultivating after becoming a demon beast and overcoming the Heavenly Tribulation of transformation would allow the demon beast to take human form and sweep through the world while seeking the Dao, just like human cultivators. At this point, a demon beast would have become a demon cultivator. For example, the Profound-vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King were both formidable demon cultivators at the Rebirth Realm.</p>
 <p>But unlike ordinary demon beasts, it was extremely difficult for some primordial divine beasts and variant beasts to take human form, and some like Bai Kui were even unable to take human form. This little fellow was a top auspicious beast born from the heaven and earth and possessed perfect intelligence, yet was unable to take human form for his entire life.</p>
 <p>This was the restraints of the Heaven Dao’s laws, and it existed in every corner of the heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat was at the eye of the storm, and above it was a ball of exceedingly dazzling lighting arcs converged together that crackled as they emitted a terrifying aura that caused one’s heart to palpitate.</p>
 <p>Woo!</p>
 <p>The Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat roared into the sky, the ghastly fangs within its bloody mouth were 3m long and extremely sharp. The consequences of being bitten by it were obvious! If these fangs were to fall into the hands of an equipment refiner and tempered with a cauldron, it was even able to be refined into top-grade profound-rank flying swords!</p>
 <p><i>After such an enormous Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat took human form, to what extent would its strength be? </i>Chen Xi was over 5 meters away and was able to feel that the True Essence of this vile beast was at least stronger than him by no less than 10 times, and it was exceedingly astonishing.</p>
 <p>“Shit! Chen Xi! There’re people approaching here, and their auras are extremely strong. Looks like it’s not only us who are hunting for this vile beast’s Inner Core.” Ling Bai seemed to have noticed something, and his face sank instantly as he spoke swiftly.</p>
 <p>As soon as Ling Bai finished speaking, Chen Xi’s Divine Perception noticed that there were two figures rapidly approaching from the extremely far away. Their movement technique was like a bolt of lightning, and it was only an instant before they’d arrived before the blood colored mountain and silently concealed themselves.</p>
 <p>But this was normal as well. The commotion caused by the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat was too great, and it was impossible to not draw the attention of others.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat on the peak of the mountain seemed to have sensed danger, and its pair of eyes that were like lanterns swept towards the base of the mountain before emitting a sharp and shrill cry that was ferocious and brutal, seeming to want to scare away the enemies that had arrived.</p>
 <p>However, this type of intimidation as utterly useless, as anyone was able to perceive that it was at the critical moment of its transformation now. The Heavenly Tribulation floated without striking above him, and it utterly didn’t dare divert its attention, let alone give up halfway. Otherwise, it would surely die beneath the Heavenly Tribulation and transform into ash.</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Those two bastards actually want to take advantage of our prey!” Ling Bai’s little face surged with killing intent as he said coldly, “Chen Xi, when that vile beast suffers the Heavenly Tribulation later and is in its weakest state. You make a move right away and I’ll go stop those two people.”</p>
 <p>“The auras of those two people are formidable, and they ought to be at Golden Core Realm. Will you be alright by yourself?” Chen Xi frowned.</p>
 <p>“It’s not like I’m killing them, it’s only stopping them for a while, so I’m still able to do it. You must be swift, and we’ll flee right after you kill that vile beast. I believe they won’t be able to chase after us.” Ling Bai sneered slyly.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you must be careful and flee if you’re unable to stop them. Even if we don’t gain this vile beast’s Inner Core, you must not get yourself injured.” Chen Xi instructed.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, in the sky that was pitch black like ink, a gigantic bolt of lightning that was thick like a bucket and carried along a violent and terrifying aura fiercely struck down, and even if they were extremely far away, Chen Xi still felt a wave of fear in his heart.</p>
 <p>This was a Heavenly Tribulation that contained the will of the Heaven Dao, and it was absolutely not something an ordinary bolt of lightning could compare to.</p>
 <p>Woo!</p>
 <p>An enormous roar sounded out as the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat unfolded its six pairs of wings, and a surging energy emitted out from its body. When facing the Heavenly Tribulation, it stood there without the slightest intention of avoiding!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A few pairs of this wings of this fellow that possessed the bloodline of a primordial variant beast was instantly struck by the bolt of lightning, causing it to emit a shrill cry of extreme pain. But the two bulges on its head actually started to grow with a speed that was visible to the eye into two horns that were covered in brilliant flowing lights!</p>
 <p>Crack!</p>
 <p>The instant the horns grew out, they were severed by the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat with its sharp claws before being stuffed into its mouth and swallowed. At the same time, its enormous figure that covered an area of 300 meters shockingly started to shrink under the surging strikes of the Heavenly Tribulation, and the scales, sharp claws, and fangs all over its body started to fall off.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>After the final bolt of Heavenly Tribulation struck down, the clouds and mist in the sky that were pitch black like ink instantly dispersed, allowing the sky to recover its azure clearness, whereas the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat had a weak aura and was covered in scars and blood, yet its body was shrinking bit by bit, and it wouldn’t be long before it would converge into human form.</p>
 <p>“Go!” Ling Bai shouted out in a low voice and transformed into a dazzling gold light that shot explosively towards the place those two people were hiding.</p>
 <p>At practically the exact same time, Chen Xi tapped the tip of his feet on the ground, and his entire body was like a strand of a gale of lightning as he flashed swiftly up the blood colored mountain. He hadn’t even arrived yet his right hand had already stuck out towards the air, and the Shaman Energy in his entire body surged out to transform into a Grand Astral Palm that covered an area of 300 meters as it fiercely grabbed towards the Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat.</p>
 <p>This vile beast had just overcome the Heavenly Tribulation, and its strength was at its weakest state. At this moment, Chen Xi executed the Grand Astral Palm with his entire strength because he wanted to capture it in one go.</p>
 <p>The speed of the Grand Astral Palm was extremely swift, and although it didn’t surpass the speed of sound, the distance of around a kilometer was surmounted in the blink of an eye. This Six-Winged Blood Dragonbat’s body had already shrunk to cover an area of around 50 meters and when it was fiercely grabbed by the Grand Astral Palm, it instantly emitted a miserable and enraged roar, and it almost struggled free from the enormous palm. Fortunately, after it withstood the Heavenly Tribulation, its strength was already weak to the extreme, and it was instantly covered by the large palm before being dragged towards Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>“Splitting up? Hmph! We noticed both of you long ago, leave your lives behind!”</p>
 <p>“Xue Chen, you go kill that kid! I’ll deal with this strange little thing!”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, two explosive shouts sounded out at almost the exact same time. Along with these shouts, a black figure abruptly leaped out from the base of the mountain, and it was swift like a bolt of lightning as it flickered successively in the sky before coming close to Chen Xi and slapped out with a palm strike from the sky.</p>
 <p>This figure that was called Xue Chen actually didn’t care about the Grand Astral Palm and directly moved to kill Chen Xi. His palm that struck out was piercingly cold and ferocious, and emitted streams of winds that were like blades, and its speed had even attained an exceedingly shocking level.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was shocked in his heart, yet his reaction was extremely swift as well. At practically the instant this figure attacked, a top-grade yellow-rank sharp sword had already appeared in Chen Xi’s hand, and his wrist rotated to execute the Kun Sword of Ground that was peerless under the heavens in defense!</p>
 <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>
 <p>Sword lights danced about as sword qi tore through the sky, and they transformed into the dense energy of the ground that coiled around the surrounding of Chen Xi’s body. This sword move contained the meaning of covering the entire universe and every direction, and it seemed as if any attack would be unable to escape the defense of this sword move.</p>
 <p>The Kun Sword of Ground was the number one sword move in defense amongst the eight great sword moves of the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, and after experiencing five years of deduction, Chen Xi had long since thoroughly grasped its profundity and essence. At the instant he executed it, his entire body seemed as if it had transformed into the ground beneath his feet and was unshakable.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Xue Chen’s palm strike was instantly obliterated within these sword shadows that were dense like the ground, but the terrifying strength that was contained within this palm strike had instead shook Chen Xi to the point he took three heavy steps back.</p>
 <p>“Eh! A Violet Palace Realm cultivator like you is actually able to withstand one of my palm strikes?” In the distance, the figure called Xue Chen spoke in surprise.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Chen Xi had clearly seen this person’s appearance. This was a young man with a handsome appearance who wore Daoist robes that had a white crane pattern embroidered on them. The crane’s wings were unfolded, intending to fly far into the nine heavens, and a desire to soar above the clouds appeared out of thin air from it, causing this young man to seem like a dragon amongst men, an unparalleled genius.</p>
 <p>Moreover, this young man possessed an extremely deep and vast aura, and even though Chen Xi was unable to guess his strength, according to Chen Xi’s experience, Chen Xi was extremely sure that it was at least at the Golden Core Realm.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! I only used 50% of my strength earlier. You don’t have to feel lucky, as you’re dead today without a doubt!” Xue Chen glanced at Chen Xi, and his gaze was like a king that looked down on all life, superior and filled with aggressiveness.</p>
 <p>“Oh, really?” Chen Xi said calmly, and the corner of his gaze swept the surroundings as a plan arose within his heart.</p>
 <p>“Then try another palm strike of mine.” Xue Chen laughed in disdain as he raised his hand and made a gesture towards the air. The energy on his palm condensed without being emitted, and the terrifying and vast energy on his palm instead became thicker and more condensed, causing it to seem as if he had a lofty and enormous mountain in his hand.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Chen Xi replied extremely readily, yet his movements weren’t slow at all. The tip of his feet tapped on the ground as the tip of his sword shook, and the Xun Sword of Wind that was like a shadow and possessed boundless variations pierced out.</p>
 <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>
 <p>A strong wind, a breeze, a gale, a squall… Various types of insights of the wind were contained within the myriad of sword move variations, and it seemed like a world of wind that wanted to sweep through the heaven and the earth and sweep away the injustice in the world!</p>
