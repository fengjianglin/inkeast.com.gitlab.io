Various types of tempests emerged in an endless stream and swept through the heavens and the earth to swallow everything in their path. Moreover, various aquatic beasts and demon beasts would bore out from these tempests to capture their prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flesh and skin of these aquatic beasts and demon beasts were useful to cultivators and possessed a shocking value. But similarly, the magic treasures, bodies, and cultivation techniques of cultivators were exceedingly useful to these aquatic beasts and demon beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Primitive Sea, there were numerous aquatic beasts and demon beasts that hid in the depths of the sea while awaiting an opportunity to launch an assault on human cultivators, whereas the even more formidable beasts would conceal themselves within the tempests and launch attacks on human cultivators from there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These beasts possessed intelligence, and under the nurturing of the Necro Baleful Qi, their natures had become violent and bloodthirsty, causing them to be extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Chen Xi, Pei Yu, and the others had encountered an adverse situation like this — a tempest of sea demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Everywhere it passed, even space was torn apart into pieces before being obliterated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous tempest vortexes raging on the pitch black surface of the sea, and countless sea demons that possessed a variety of odd shapes could be faintly seen hiding within the tempests. They were dense to the point they simply seemed like an overbearing sea demon army that could cover the heavens and the earth while demonic qi shook the heavens, and it caused one’s scalp to go numb</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi noticed with a single glance that in the tempest vortex that enveloped the heavens and the earth, the sea demons at the most outer area were at the Violet Palace Realm, and their numbers were the most. Further in were Golden Hall Realm sea demons, and at the center were actually Golden Core Realm sea demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These sea demons were mostly fishes, yet their appearances were exceedingly savage and were in all sorts of strange shapes. Their auras were violent while their entire bodies were fully tainted with Necro Baleful Qi, and they were like fish yaksha, asuras of the sea, ferocious and bloodthirsty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humans!”</span></p>

But in the eyes of these sea demons, they were like the most tempting delicacies in the world, causing them to simply seem like flies that had smelt blood, and they roared furiously as they charged over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Chen Xi and the others instantly became heavy. These countless tempest vortexes and the sea demons that were like a powerful army had already completely blocked off the path ahead, and if they wanted to enter deeper into the Primitive Sea, then they could only go against it head on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dense swarm of sea demons were like tidewater as they charged out of the tempest and covered the heavens and the earth like locusts as they gushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first to pounce over was a group of azure-scaled crab demons. These azure-scaled crab demons were completely covered in armor that emitted a brilliant dark light, and all of them possessed an aura at the Violet Palace Realm. They numbered in over 10,000 and actually joined forces to launch a water type technique that smashed down towards Chen Xi and the others!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water type technique seemed capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas as it surged with force that was violent like lightning, and there were strands of Necro Baleful Qi within it. The technique charged into the sky and covered the earth, and it was actually soon to develop the profundities of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A group of Violet Palace Realm minor demons dare be so rampant? They’re truly courting death!” Young Master Zhou roared furiously as Dao Insight sprayed out from his entire body, and then he swept out towards the air before him with a single finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, this was the Azurespirit Void Finger, a perfect Dao Grade martial technique Young Master Zhou had obtained from the Martial Dao Divine Throne!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant the enormous finger appeared in the sky, it directly blasted apart the technique of the azure-scaled crab demons, and then the might of the finger spread to the surroundings and crushed another thousand plus azure-scaled crab demons to death on the spot, causing them to transform into severed limbs and shattered flesh that tainted the surface of the sea red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Zhou was filled with the desire to kill, and he let out a long howl before flashing out of the Thousandplume Dragonboat. He moved within the group of sea demons while his finger swiped out repeatedly, and every single swipe would reap the lives of a few hundreds of thousands of sea demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Pei Yu, Cui Xiuhong, Wei Muyun, and Leng Qianqiu had made a move as well, and all the martial techniques they executed were perfect Dao Grade martial techniques. They moved freely within the army of sea demons while divine lights danced in the sky and beams of light smashed to the ground, and group after group of sea demons were easily crushed by them, causing them to reveal extremely terrifying lethality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially Pei Yu, he deserved being a proud genius of the heavens, the leader of all. His clothes fluttered while he held a sword that was snow white like jade and moved about in the group of demon beasts as if he was strolling in a courtyard, relaxed and at ease, whereas his sword qi was like lightning that suffused the sky and covered the world, causing countless sea demons to be torn apart like paper and lose their lives beneath this sword insight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, based on his relaxed appearance, he’d obviously only utilized less than half his strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Chen Xi had no choice but to admit that Pei Yu was a formidable figure indeed when he saw this scene. Not only was Pei Yu’s scheming ability terrifying, even his combat strength was extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sea demons were of an enormous amount and seemed boundless, Chen Xi couldn’t be bothered to continue thinking about anything else, and he leaped out to charge into the group of sea demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The nearby sea demons instantly lost their lives under this strike and transformed into nothingness, and not even bits and pieces of them remained under this strike that possessed an extremely shocking impetus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t utilize the Talisman Armament nor did he utilize Divine Abilities as his main objective while charging forward and slaughtering in the tempest of sea demons was to temper the Grand Obliteration Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Obliteration Fist was exceedingly incomplete and lacked the Obliteration Dao Insight. Strictly speaking, Chen Xi’s fusion of the Grand Dao profundities of water, fire, Yin, and Yang into it still lacked the tempering of live combat. Presently, there were countless sea demons on the sea, allowing him to kill to his heart’s content, so it was precisely the best time to temper the Grand Obliteration Fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the passage of time, every fist Chen Xi struck out would allow him to obtain even more comprehension towards the Grand Obliteration Fist, and his Fist Insight became even more condensed. Moreover, his moves stopped adhering to a single pattern and started to become free and nimble, causing it to reveal various variations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides that, the number of sea demons that had perished at his hand was madly increasing at a speed that was visible to the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Obliteration Fist has a total of three moves. Presently, I’m only capable of executing the entire might of the first move, Merciless Fire and Water, as for the Chaotic Obliteration, I’m only capable of executing its form yet unable to release the intent within it. It seems like I don’t lack technique, but…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Live combat!</span></p>

So long as it has passed through the test of live combat, one would be able to know the might of any technique and if it possessed any flaws. This is called seeking out the flaws to be mended, eliminating the impure to retain the pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ve always been comprehending and pondering about it by myself in the past, and I’ve instead fallen into the wrong path. It’s no different than drawing up plans behind closed doors and idle theorizing, and it will forever be unable to allow me to utilize the entire might of a cultivation technique…</span></p>

What does that fellow Chen Xi want to do? Entering deep into the group of sea demons alone seemed to be slightly risky. After all, the deeper one went, the stronger the sea demons would be, if…” When he saw Chen Xi was soon to vanish in the depths of the group of sea demons, Young Master Zhou’s heart couldn’t help but tighten and feel slightly worried.</span></p>

As expected of the number one expert in the Darchu Dynasty’s younger generation, he possesses peerless courage that makes one sigh with admiration.” In the distance, Cui Xiuhong let out a strange laughter as he spoke sarcastically, and it was filled with ridicule.</span></p>

Instantly, the entire area of the sea was overturned while Yin and Yang turned chaotic, and all the sea demons in an area of 500km were shattered completely into powder. Even the boundless space was shattered into pieces and fell into great chaos.</span></p>
