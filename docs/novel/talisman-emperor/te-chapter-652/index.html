It emitted an extremely violent and terrifying sharp aura that threw this expanse of the heavens and the earth into disorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was astounded and were shocked by this terrifying aura to the point of retreating repeatedly because this imposing aura was too horrifying, and once they were to be affected by it, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leaf was large like a millstone and completely golden, and it was branded with dense, complicated, and extremely profound veins and striations. It floated in midair like a blazing sun in the sky, and it emitted an extremely surging aura of the Grand Dao of Metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most astounding of it all was the aura of the Grand Dao of Metal sprinkled down like a rain of light, and it transformed into numerous small golden figures that fluttered about, danced about, and leaped about around the leaf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Grand Dao Fragment!” Someone exclaimed in shock while his breathing became heavy, and even his eyes had turned red. It was as if he’d seen a peerless beauty lightly removing her silk robe to reveal her flawless body that was capable of causing countless people to drool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emergence of the Dark Parasol’s Abyss this time had drawn over countless experts from all over, and practically 99% of them had come for the sake of the Grand Dao Fragments within the Dark Parasol Secret Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were able to obtain one of the fragments, then it would undoubtedly be like obtaining a great fortune, and it was sufficient to allow anyone to experience an explosive increase in strength within a short period of time, allowing one to soar into the sky with a single leap and shock the world with a single brilliant feat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now a precious treasure of the heavens and the earth like this had emerged into the world, and it instantly shocked everyone present and drew countless burning and covetous gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was naturally moved to the extreme. With his comprehension ability that could be considered to be monstrous, he’d only mastered the Grand Dao of Metal to the Advanced Realm, and if he wanted to improve, he could only rely on accumulating comprehension over a long period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the profundities of a Grand Dao can’t be compared to by a Minor Dao, and it was truly too difficult to comprehend it to the Perfection Realm. Ordinary cultivators were probably unable to attain such a level in their entire lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this reason that so many experts would be drawn over by the emergence of the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So Chen Xi would absolutely not let such a fortuitous encounter that was bestowed by the heavens slip by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Charge!” Finally, someone was unable to restrain himself any longer, and he charged towards the Grand Dao Fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, there were still a few people that had arrived here, and they were only around 100 in number. This opportunity was difficult to come by because once more people were to arrive, this place would surely be in great chaos, and the competition would become fairly horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone understood this, so in the next moment, almost everyone present strove to be the first as they charged over while emitting whistling sounds and covered in various protective magic treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi intended to make a move as well, but he stopped his footsteps when he observed it with the Eye of Divine Truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he perceived that the surroundings of the Grand Dao Fragment were filled with a violent and sharp aura. It was a chaotic flow formed from the Grand Dao of Metal, and it was extremely dangerous and seemed like the eye of a storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, even though those cultivators that charged over first had magic treasures protecting their bodies, they cried out with shock when they arrived before the Grand Dao Fragment because their magic treasures were crushed into pieces, and it caused them to have no choice but to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This group of people had failed, but some were not resigned to failure, and they put their lives on their line as they charged forward. The outcome was that not only were their magic treasures destroyed, but even their bodies were also minced apart, causing a rain of blood to spray out as they perished on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! This Grand Dao Fragment is actually so difficult to subdue. Could it be that this is a test as well, and only those with formidable strengths are able to obtain it?” Someone cursed with a gloomy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, everyone that charged forward had stopped moving, and they scattered to the surroundings and took their positions while thinking and discussing a way to solve this problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Grand Dao Fragments are formed from the Laws of the Heaven Dao grasped by the Dark Parasol Divine Tree before it perished. If one wants to obtain it, then one either requires sufficient strength to subdue it forcefully, or to protect one’s self with a formidable magic treasure and go against it ceaselessly until completely exhausting the violet chaotic flow in the surroundings of the Grand Dao Fragment.” In next to no time, they made a conclusion, and it caused all their expressions to become extremely unsightly. If their strengths were formidable, they would have made a move since a long time ago, and why would they have waited until now? As for utilizing magic treasures to go against it, that was even more dangerous. Not to mention if it would succeed, what if they suffered the surprise attack of another?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people refused to believe it and flew forward occasionally, and they returned empty-handed in the end. The chaotic flow in the surroundings of the Grand Dao Fragment was too terrifying to the point even a top-grade heaven-rank magic treasure was easily destroyed by it, and even a Quasi Immortal Artifact suffered a certain level of damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fundamental reason was that this Grand Dao Fragment was branded with the profundities of the Grand Dao of Metal, whereas metal mainly indicated killing. Amongst the numerous Grand Dao profundities, it was the fiercest, so its might was naturally shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi calmed his mind and observed for a moment before deciding to make a move because formidable fluctuations were coming from the distance. Obviously, numerous experts were rushing over, and it would become troublesome if more people were to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emergence of a Grand Dao Fragment could already be called a great fortuitous encounter, and so long as it was noticed by others, no one would let it slip by easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi soared into the sky and approached the Grand Dao Fragment. He didn’t rely on the strength of his body but utilized the Profound Disruption Divinelight to deal with it. This light innately countered the five elements and was comparable to the Fivecolored Divinelight of the Primordial Times that could be ranked in the top 10, so it possessed a shocking might. Even though this Grand Dao Fragment was formidable, the Grand Dao of Metal it contained was similarly part of the five elements, and it just happened to be countered by the Profound Disruption Divinelight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>

Even though the speed was slow, it was enough to make Chen Xi feel excited. At the very least, it proved the method he used was possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? That kid is actually about to approach the Grand Dao Fragment?” Someone noticed this scene and cried out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s actually him, that young man that defeated the expert from the Flameox Clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! Could it be that the Grand Dao Fragment is going to fall into his hands?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, that might not be the case. Can’t we make a move after he breaks through that barrier and seize the Grand Dao Fragment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at Chen Xi’s figure that moved forward bit by bit, the gazes of everyone present flickered without end, and they made preparations to take advantage of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But someone was already unable to restrain himself, and he intended to kill Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

Moreover, it carried a terrifying penetrative force and a shocking impetus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Interesting, you’re actually able to block a strike of mine.” Accompanying this voice was the appearance of an extremely robust figure. This young man’s entire body was enveloped by crimson red flames, whereas his smooth forehead had a lone horn growing from it. The horn seemed as if it was made from flames, and it emitted a terrifying energy fluctuation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few people following behind him. All of them had rather good strengths, and all of them had a lone horn on their foreheads.</span></p>

Looks like they’ve come to take revenge for their clansmen!” The eyes of everyone squinted as they guessed the reason for this attack. Chen Xi had tossed a young man from the Flameox Clan into the golden lake earlier, and that young man had died miserably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! You’re bound to die today. Since you dared to kill a member of my Flameox Clan, then die!” The robust young man in the lead shouted explosively as his figure shook, and then flames that shot up 30km into the sky with a bang, causing the heavens and the earth to quake.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was astounded.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

Chen Xi’s entire body glowed as a pair of grey and hazy wings unfolded on his back, and it covered his back and blocked the surging flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A scene that shocked everyone appeared. The surging flames hadn’t even approached Chen Xi when they were crushed by a terrifying energy fluctuation, and they dispersed into the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was actually exceedingly shocked in his heart. This Flameox Clan expert was extremely formidable because the surging flames contained a boundless force of incineration. Obviously, it was a formidable Dao Art, and if it wasn’t for him relying on the Wings of Disruption, he would be utterly incapable of dealing with it so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this thought only flashed in his mind for an instant. In the next moment, Chen Xi was already concentrated in the barrier before him, and the Profound Disruption Divinelight swept out to eliminate the barrier while he stepped forward and was almost able to touch the Grand Dao Fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the pressure he endured grew greater and greater, and it was extremely dense. He was at the critical moment, and so long as he destroyed the final line of defense, the Grand Dao Fragment would be within reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Wings of Disruption! The ultimate technique of the Azure Phoenix Clan that has been lost for a long time!” The robust young man’s pupils constricted as his expression changed because he recognized the Divine Ability Chen Xi executed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s make a move together and seize this opportunity to annihilate this kid!” The robust young man shouted explosively as he transformed into a Flameox that was coiled with a violent flaming glow, and his hooves stepped on the air as he opened his mouth and sprayed out a sea of flames that covered the heavens and the earth as it swept towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Flameox Clan experts at the side attacked successively as well. For a time, the entire heavens and the earth were filled with flames, and it tainted 5,000km in the vicinity red and carried a monstrous and extremely oppressive impetus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s gaze went cold as boundless fury arose in his heart. If he didn’t resist while facing such an attack, he would surely suffer a heavy injury, whereas if he did resist, then his efforts from before would be wasted, and he’d miss the opportunity to obtain the Grand Dao Fragment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, there were numerous experts casting covetous gazes from the surroundings, and there were even more people rushing over from the distance. The situation was filled with variables. So, if he lost the opportunity before him, it would be impossible for him to find another.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right after that, he seemed to have noticed something, and a wisp of a strange expression suddenly suffused his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, he’d already made a decision and avoided the attacks that covered the heavens and the earth without the slightest hesitation before turning around and retreating. He even disregarded the Grand Dao Fragment that was right before his eyes, causing him to see extremely resolute and decisive.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the eyes of everyone, Chen Xi’s actions were normal. If a Grand Dao Fragment was lost, he could still find another, but if he lost his life, it was impossible for him to be reborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! I guess you’re smart! I’ll come take your lowly life once I obtain the Grand Dao Fragment!” The expert from the Flameox Clan grunted coldly with disdain before instructing the others to keep a close watch on Chen Xi, whereas he himself charged into the sky and towards the Grand Dao Fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, 90% of the barrier in the surroundings of the Grand Dao Barrier had been eliminated by Chen Xi, and the robust young man could be said to have seized a great advantage. So long as he eliminated the final line of defense of the barrier, he would be able to obtain the Grand Dao Fragment easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh, he worked hard for so long, yet the fruits are enjoyed by another instead. That kid is probably on the verge of going mad with rage, right?” The gazes the people in the surroundings shot at Chen Xi had become strange.</span></p>
