 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

They felt that if this continued on, then their hearts would surely be unable to endure it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, in the next moment, Liang Bing had moved her attention, and her gaze descended onto the other young men and young woman that stood by her side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these young men and young woman were top experts of the Liang Clan’s younger generation that had just arrived, and practically all their rankings were in the top hundred. All of them possessed extraordinary strength, and there was no lack of existences at the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young disciples like these possessed lofty statuses in the Liang Clan, and it was very rare for them to make an appearance altogether. Only Liang Bing, the heir of the clan, was capable of summoning them over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, when they saw Liang Qun was struck off the arena with a single blow, the expressions of all these young disciples had become surprised, indeterminate, and heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which one of you will go…” Liang Bing considered her words and was about to say something when she was interrupted with a tall young man that laughed bitterly. “Eldest Young Miss, we charged to our current rankings with great difficulty, so there’s no need to use it as a whetstone, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, it caused the expressions of the nearby Liang Clan disciples to become strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They aren’t willing to fight Chen Xi because they aren’t confident in their victory?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is like boosting the morale of another and underestimating one’s own strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when they thought about it carefully, most of them displayed their understanding. After all, Chen Xi’s strength was too heaven defying, and it couldn’t be estimated by convention. Even though he was merely at the intermediate-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm, even Liang Kun who was ranked one hundred and thirty fifth and Liang Qun that was ranked one hundred and twenty second had lost at his hand. So who would dare take him lightly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing’s beautiful brows rose as she looked at the others and said, “All of you aren’t willing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other young men and young women glanced at each other before nodding in unison. They really weren’t confident in defeating Chen Xi, so they weren’t willing to be his sparring partner because if they lost, then it would be slightly shameful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, it was embarrassing if the news got out. For example, Yin Hun and Yin Wanxun who’d challenged Chen Xi in the Martial Emperor Domain had fallen to laughingstocks of Southbridge Continent. Even if everyone was clearly aware that Chen Xi’s strength was absolutely not as simple as the cultivation Chen Xi possessed, it was embarrassing in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just think about it, when one went out in the future and everyone pointed and discussed. “Look, that fellow is at the intermediate-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm, yet he actually lost to a young man at the intermediate-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of feeling was truly unbearable, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, if they won, then they could stand with their head held high. But the key was they weren’t confident in their victory, so when both of these were compared, they chose to refuse in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing couldn’t help but curse when she saw this. “Spineless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone laughed bitterly and didn’t give any further explanation because they were unable to explain. If Chen Xi was another expert at the Mysterious Immortal Realm, then even if he was stronger than them, they would dare to have a fight with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the key was…Chen Xi was only at the intermediate-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What would they do if they lost to Chen Xi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Be reduced to laughingstocks of the cultivation world and be ashamed to leave their clan in the future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing’s brows knit together because she never thought that she would encounter such a situation. Of course, she was able to understand the thoughts of her clansmen. But if they didn’t spar with Chen Xi, then could it be that she had to?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she was respected as the heir of the Liang Clan, she wasn’t the patriarch in the end, so she was naturally unable to forcefully order these clansmen to fight Chen Xi because if she were to do that, then would anyone support her in ascending the position of patriarch?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the arena, Chen Xi was slightly shocked by this sight, and he pondered briefly before he had a plan and said, “How about this? I’ll improve the might of the Immortal Artifact in the possession of the person that’s willing to spar with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the battle with Liang Kun earlier, he noticed that Liang Kun’s Immortal Artifact was an incomplete Talisman Armament as well. Even though its might was comparable to a high-rank Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact, if it were to be refined once more with the correct method, then its might would at least increase by around forty percent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forty percent was sufficient to improve Liang Kun’s combat strength by a level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, it was precisely because of this that Chen Xi realized the Immortal Artifacts in the possession of these geniuses of the Liang Clan were probably existences similar to Talisman Armaments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely based on this understanding that Chen Xi spoke of such a condition, and he wasn’t worried that it wouldn’t move them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, the entire crowd was in an uproar. All of them didn’t dare believe their ears.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What did this fellow say? He’ll help improve the might of the Immortal Artifact possessed by anyone that spars with him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My god, this fellow isn’t joking, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As disciples of a clan renowned in the Dao of Talismans, being skilled in the Dao of Talismans were a skill all of them had to grasp. How could they not know that their Immortal Artifacts weren’t like those sold on the market? Their Immortal Artifacts were refined through a unique equipment refinement technique, and even though they were more or less flawed, they had attained their limits in might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the elders in the clan didn’t dare rashly declare the ability to improve the might of an Immortal Artifact which had been refined a long time ago. So since Chen Xi actually dared to speak such nonsense, how could they possibly believe him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, everyone looked at Chen Xi with doubtful gazes. They felt that for the sake of rising in the rankings on the Continental Ascensio Rankings, this fellow had actually started to stop at nothing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing was delighted in her heart instead upon hearing these words because it couldn’t be any better if she was able to gain Chen Xi’s help to refine the Immortal Artifacts in the possession of her clansmen. It was even to the extent that she could foresee that the overall combat strength of her clansmen would increase greatly after this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, this meant that the overall strength of their Liang Clan’s younger generation would greatly pull apart the gap between them and the Gu, Luo, and Yin Clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more she thought about it, the more excited Liang Bing was. If all of this really occurred, then it would absolutely add another strong guarantee to her ability to inherit the Liang Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when she saw the undisguised doubt on the faces of her clansmen, she was instantly infuriated.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These idiots have eyes but fail to see!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing didn’t dare hesitate as she was deeply afraid Chen Xi would change his mind, and she directly said to a nearby disciple, “The few of you, bring over the Treasure Measurement Stele. Quickly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Treasure Measurement Stele?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was bewildered when they heard this. They were naturally aware that the Treasure Measurement Stele was a miraculous stele used to test the might of an Immortal Artifact, and the might of any Immortal Artifact could be clearly reflected by grade and rank.</span></p>

I’m really at a loss for words.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi raised his eyes to look and noticed that the surface of the Treasure Measurement Stele revealed in proper order the words ordinary, Darkspirit, Cosmic, Valiant, and Void. Moreover, every single grade was further divided into the high, medium, and low ranks, causing it to seem extremely neat and orderly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was aware that the Treasure Measurement Stele was an extremely common treasure in the Immortal Dimension. Especially within stores that sold Immortal Artifacts, most of them possessed a Treasure Measurement Stele.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effect of this treasure was extremely simple. It was capable of determining the might of an Immortal Artifact and dividing it into various different grades and ranks. This was the standard of appraising an Immortal Artifact.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, everyone noticed that a dazzling golden radiance suddenly flashed into appearance on the stele. It swiftly ascended from the area that indicated an ordinary Immortal Artifact, and it only stopped after reaching the top of the position that indicated a high-rank Cosmic Grade Immortal Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That position was linked to the even higher Valiant Grade, and this meant that the might of the Silverlight Shuttle had already arrived at the limit of the Cosmic Grade and could be considered to be of the extreme-rank!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was astounded, and some even rubbed their eyes while seeming to be filled with disbelief.</span></p>

But as far as they knew, the might of this treasure was merely at the medium-rank of the Cosmic Grade.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did it suddenly become a high-rank Cosmic Grade Immortal Artifact and has even attained the extreme-rank?</span></p>

Especially after a treasure has been refined completely, it was extremely difficult even to improve its might by a shred, let alone instantly improve its might by a rank and even join the ranks of the extreme-rank. This was simply unimaginable!</span></p>

As she looked at their dumbstruck appearances, she couldn’t help but feel slight disdain.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These fellows are really inexperienced.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing turned around and revealed an expression that said ‘Who else?’ and it caused that Liang Clan disciple to be extremely embarrassed.</span></p>

All of them looked at Chen Xi with surprise and bewilderment because even if the facts were laid right before their eyes, they still didn’t dare believe that Chen Xi who was only at the intermediate-stage of the Heavenly Immortal Realm would possess such shocking attainments in equipment refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they were similarly aware that with the Eldest Young Miss’s disposition, she would absolutely not lie. Thus, in the next moment, the crowd was in an uproar.</span></p>
