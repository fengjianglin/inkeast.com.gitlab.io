If nothing unexpected happened, he was already one amongst the top 100 of the Allstar Meeting this time, and his next objective was to charge into the top 10!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without wasting any more time, Chen Xi chatted with Fan Yunlan, Zhen Liuqing, and the others for a short moment before taking out a few Shaman Blood Crystals and meditating with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle with Huangfu Chongming and the others caused his Shaman Energy to be exhausted greatly. Especially the Grand Astral Palms he executed at the end had an extremely shocking consumption of Shaman Energy. If it wasn’t for his body refinement cultivation having attained the advanced-stage of the Golden Core Realm already, he’d probably be utterly incapable of executing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, he’d obtained a great amount of Shaman Blood Crystals from Ji Yue, so his Shaman Energy could be recovered extremely quickly, and he didn’t have to worry about the competition and battles that were to come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he closed his eyes in meditation, Chen Xi’s gaze fell slightly, and the corner of his field of vision glanced towards the beautiful figure at the utmost center. That beautiful figure had been sitting cross-legged there from the beginning until the end while her entire body was enveloped in hazy mist, and she seemed like a celestial maiden that remained aloof from the world. No matter what happened in the surroundings, it seemed as if it was incapable of drawing her attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like a soundless feeling of proudness and aloofness, as if she stood above all living creatures.</span></p>

Qing Xiuyi was unlike Fan Yunlan, she was a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal, and she possessed the pride of an immortal in her bones. So there was only a single way to resolve the hatred between them, and it was to completely defeat her in battle and make her pride have no choice but to yield before him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi sat on a divine throne, there were still another 70 plus empty divine thrones in the surroundings of the sacrificial altar, and for the sake of these divine thrones, the cultivators in the surroundings of the square completely exploded in an extremely intense battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the cultivators present had become eminent from the 50,000 cultivators that participated in the beginning, and they’d overcome many difficulties on the way to finally arrive here. Thus, their strengths were naturally and undoubtedly formidable, and if placed in the outside world, their strengths were sufficient for them to be called outstanding talents.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the time for an incense stick to burn, all 100 divine thrones had an owner, whereas the cultivators that failed were completely eliminated and sent out of the Martial Dao Domain.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant the fluctuation swept past his body, Chen Xi acutely sensed an ancient, mysterious, and irresistible intent envelop his soul, and before he could react, his soul felt dazed as if it was sucked into an enormous vortex…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

It shook the heavens and the earth like a morning bell, and the melody of the Grand Dao enlightened all and caused the hearts of everyone to be bathed in boundless tranquility.</span></p>

Thick lights that were dazzling and resplendent were emitted from countless fist sized balls of light that flowed and whistled through the boundless world of divine lights in a dense and vast array.</span></p>

The reason was extremely simple, it only contained two Minor Daos, the Cloudray and Goldstreak Minor Daos. One was a subset of the Grand Dao of Water, the other was a type of Mist Dao Insight. Obviously, this was far from being capable of moving him.</span></p>

If I continue searching like this, I’ll be unable to obtain a martial technique I’m satisfied with no matter how much of time I spend. Why don’t I head towards the depths of the altar? Perhaps the formidable martial techniques are hidden in the core area…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he pondered, Chen Xi charged within the boundless world of divine lights towards the core area of the sacrificial altar. But what caused him to be speechless is that the space within this sacrificial altar was too vast, and he’d flown for almost an entire two hours yet hadn’t figured out where exactly the central area was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was extremely normal when he thought about it. If the formidable Dao Grade martial techniques were so easy to obtain, then perhaps all of them would have been seized away by others since long ago. How could he possibly have a chance?</span></p>

An oppressive force?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Chen Xi moved forward, he suddenly felt a shapeless force press down onto him, and it seemed to extremely reject his approach, causing his speed to slow down greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pressure is probably greater the closer one is to the center of the sacrificial altar. If I follow according to this deduction, then extremely formidable Dao Grade martial technique might really exist there like I thought!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was not shocked, but delighted instead, and he didn’t hesitate in the slightest to circulate the strength in his entire body and continue flashing forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But along with the passage of time, his footsteps became sluggish, and his speed grew slower and slower. The pressure and force of rejection that existed everywhere caused Chen Xi to seem as if he’d fallen into a swamp, and it was extremely difficult for him to move forward swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The River Diagram fragment?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked, and then he instantly noticed that the River Diagram fragment that floated within his sea of consciousness was actually lightly trembling as if it possessed intelligence at this moment!</span></p>

One was from the Profound Disruption Mountain at the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, and the other was given to him by his mysterious Senior Sister that liked to dress up as a man.</span></p>

The image was divided into seven pieces with unusual shapes, and they just happened to combine with the existing River Diagram fragment to form an almost completely round pattern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d deduced from this extremely early on that the complete River Diagram ought to have split into nine pieces for some reason. He’s already obtained two pieces, and there were another seven pieces scattered in other places in the universe.</span></p>
