Their history was so long and their hidden resources and reserves were so thick that the various Dynasties of this current age were far from being able to compare with them.</span></p>

He’d smoothly overcome the tribulation and advanced into the Rebirth Realm as soon as he entered the Primeval Battlefield. Moreover, he’d broken through to the 5</span><sup>th</sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm!

Every step forward would allow one’s strength to undergo a qualitative transformation.</span></p>

Joy was attributed to the heart, and it was fire. Anger was attributed to the liver, and it was wood. Worry was attributed to the lungs, and it was metal. Longing was attributed to the spleen, and it was earth. Fear was attributed to the kidney, and it was water. This was the mechanism of the internal organs, and when one cultivated to this point, the internal organs were like divine wheels that condensed the five elements and circulated with its profundities. It was the level of attaining the 5</span><sup>th</sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm.</span></p>

Up to this point, the five elements were condensed, Yin and Yang were combined, causing the Rebirth Wheel to attain perfection.</span></p>

A cultivator was cultivating the seven emotions when cultivating the seven temperings of Rebirth. Every single tempering was a cycle of life, and it was a transformation and advancement of the essence of one’s life.</span></p>

When a traditional practitioner of medicine in the mortal world inspected a patient and spoke of internal injuries from the seven emotions, it was precisely talking about this.</span></p>

What sort of place is the Primeval City?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was clearly confused after looking through the jade slip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As far as he was concerned, because of her relationship with him, Zhen Liuqing would surely not become friends with Qing Xiuyi, but both of them just happened to be together now, and it was obviously a very strange thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi faintly felt that the reason both of them were together was surely related to Shang Kun.</span></p>

Moreover, the final test in the Primeval Battlefield will begin there.” The nearby Ling Ze seemed to have noticed Chen Xi’s bewilderment, and he explained with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chen Xi was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this way, wouldn’t it mean that Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing have already advanced to the Rebirth Realm? Looks like it isn’t just me who’s advancing with amazing speed, and the strengths of others are increasing swiftly as well.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded. “It’s very useful. Thank you, Brother Ling.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ze smiled lightly, and then he seemed to have thought of something, causing him to hesitate for a moment before he said with a deep voice, “According to my knowledge, all the disciples of the Shang Clan are formidable figures. If you meet those companions of yours, it’s best that you advise them not to join Shang Kun’s group.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ze shrugged and smiled bitterly as he said, “Don’t take it so seriously, because I heard it from others as well. The inheritance of the Shang Clan is from the Devil Sect, and it’s from the most wicked Maiden Devil Sect. The cultivation techniques they cultivate specialize in using women as a sort of elixir. The greater the natural talent of the woman, the greater the woman’s effect was to their cultivation. Of course, I merely heard of this, and even I don’t dare confirm what the truth is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he said this, it caused Chen Xi’s mood to instantly become heavy when he heard this. He had a strong premonition that Ling Ze’s words ought to be true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing were just like him, they were from the Darchu Dynasty and didn’t have the slightest relationship with the Prestigious Clans of Ancient Kingdoms, so how could they possibly willingly group together with Shang Kun?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, based on Chen Xi’s understanding, it was impossible for the two of them to be people that moved to please and flatter those that were powerful, let alone bring themselves down to follow the disciple of a Prestigious Clan of the Ancient Kingdoms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So there was surely a reason. Was it abduction? Threats? Or was he really being over suspicious?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi wished for nothing more than to instantly arrive at Primeval City and see exactly what the situation was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, no matter if he admitted or not, Qing Xiuyi was the mother of his son, Chen An, after all, whereas Zhen Liuqing was similarly an intimate friend of his. They were entangled with each other, yet didn’t have a clear relationship, but Chen Xi was similarly unable to neglect her and stand idly by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, take a look and see if the jade slip that records the method of refining the Flame God Fan is fake.” The nearby Ling Ze spoke once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi instantly came back to his senses, and he took a deep breath to restrain the trace of agitation in his heart before shaking his head. “There’s no need. Brother Ling, you can take her with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ‘she’ here was naturally referring to Bi Lingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you. Since you let me off this time, I’ll consider it as owing you my life, and I’ll repay it to you in the future.” Bi Lingyun seemed to have heaved a long sigh of relief, and she squinted her gaze at Chen Xi as she spoke seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi waved his hand and said casually, “It’s fine so long as you don’t look for trouble with me in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bi Lingyun’s beautiful brows frowned as she sensed Chen Xi’s impatience towards her, causing her to be unable to help but feel slightly irritated and embarrassed in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ve already acted so humble and have even handed over the method to refine the Flame God Fan. Could it be that my sincerity is insufficient?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, then I’ll be taking my leave first. We’ll surely meet again once you arrive at Primeval City. At that time, I’ll treat you to some drinks. Farewell.” Ling Ze hurriedly pulled Bi Lingyun over and bid his farewells to Chen Xi when he heard what Chen Xi said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Farewell.” Chen Xi cupped his fists as he sent them off with his gaze, but his mood was unable to cheer up, nor did he have the intention to pursue his enemies any longer, and he thought wholeheartedly about how to swiftly arrive at Primeval City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators in the distance that originally intended to watch the battle couldn’t help but feel a wave of disappointment when they saw the matter was dealt with in such a way, and most of them took the initiative to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They hadn’t heard the discussion between Chen Xi and Ling Ze, and it was impossible for them to know that Bi Lingyun had given up the secret technique to refine an Immortal Artifact in exchange for her life, otherwise their eyes would surely go red with envy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But everything that occurred today had already shocked them enough. Chen Xi swept through numerous experts, killing them to the point his enemies wet their pants in terror and fled in great disorder. Earlier, he even annihilated the Crown Princes of two first-rate Dynasties, and if they didn’t see it with their own two eyes, they wouldn’t believe Chen Xi had achieved such ferocious and splendid achievements in battle even if they were beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, why did you let that woman go? Could it be that you were unable to kill her because she was beautiful?” Meanwhile, Young Master Zhou walked over and spoke with a teasing expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t talk nonsense, can’t you see that Chen Xi doesn’t seem to be in a good mood!?” Huangfu Qingying’s beautiful eyes stared wide open as she glanced fiercely at Young Master Zhou, and then she looked at Chen Xi and asked. “Was it because that person from before threatened you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head and said, “That person was Ling Yu’s older brother, Ling Ze. He’s an expert from the Dartang Dynasty, and he’s a rather nice person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dartang Dynasty? That’s one of the three top Dynasties that’s equal to the Darkhan and Darjou Dynasty. That fatty Ling Yu actually has such a brother, it’s truly shocking.” Young Master Zhou spoke with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s how it is. No wonder you did that. Supposedly, these three top Dynasties maintain an intimate connection with some great powers in the Dark Reverie, so being on friendly terms with an expert of a top Dynasty is a good choice indeed.” Huangfu Qingying thought she understood Chen Xi’s thoughts and spoke with sudden understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know that the reason Chen Xi let Bi Lingyun off wasn’t because of Ling Ze but only because of a piece of information Ling Ze gave him was related to Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, no matter how great a figure Ling Ze was, or how precious the Flame God Fan was, Chen Xi didn’t intend to let Bi Lingyun off so easily. After all, this woman had once pursued him with the intention of killing him, and she’d truly acted too ruthlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to having something weighing on his mind, Chen Xi didn’t explain any further and said, “Let’s go. Let’s leave this Isle of Fallen Treasures quickly and head to Primeval City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Primeval City?” Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou were stunned. Obviously, both of them had heard of the city that stood towering at the center of the Primeval Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, the Primeval City. The final test in the Primeval Battlefield will begin there in a few more months. We have to arrive there beforehand.” When he spoke up to here, Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh as he said, “Not to mention, I just found out that Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing’s situation isn’t looking good. I’m worried something bad will happen to them, so it’s better that we rush over there as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou felt apprehensive in their hearts when they heard this, and both of them understood the seriousness of the matter, so they nodded right away.</span></p>
