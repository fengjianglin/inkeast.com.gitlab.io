It drew the attention of everyone within the campsite, and it seemed like a divine miracle was being born.</span></p>

It was the pattern of surging flames, flickering golden light, overflowing green light, all of it was extremely gorgeous and revealed extraordinary scenes.</span></p>

It was entirely covered by grey colored stones and gravel, and its color was monotonous and dry.</span></p>

Moreover, there was a type of indescribable vitality, and it seemed as if this expanse of the heavens and the earth had become rich and colorful.</span></p>

The purest quintessence energies of the heavens and the earth. At this moment, they’d descended on this wasteland that had been abandoned by the Heaven Dao, and the phenomena created by it was so grand that it caused these Ninth Hell clansmen who’d lived here for generation after generation to stare with eyes wide open and be dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strong visual impact was like a tempestuous storm that struck their hearts, and they felt an unprecedented feeling of shock!</span></p>

I once heard the Lord Priest speak of it. A long time ago before our world was abandoned by the three dimensions, practically everyone in our clan was capable of grasping and comprehending Dao Insight, allowing us to command the wind and clouds, and be all powerful with unbelievable strength.” Rock who possessed composure and maturity that far exceeded his age spoke with a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dao Insight?</span></p>

Since they were born, all of them had always been in the Ninth Hell that was abandoned by the Heaven Dao, so how could they have imagined that such a miraculous force existed in the world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inadvertently, a wisp of restlessness surged out from the depths of their hearts, and they slightly yearned to go comprehend that energy called Dao Insight as well. But, out of considerations for their face, not a single one of them was willing to ‘yield.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, they were firm and unyielding hot blooded men of the Ninth Hell tribe. Since they’d decided they wanted to go against Chen Xi, then how could they surrender just like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths puckered their lips and remained silent while they stubbornly persisted on their dignity and unyieldingness.&nbsp;</span></p>

She felt that if the situation continued on like this, then even if these little fellows didn’t falter in their actions, their heart would probably have been conquered by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It isn’t just them, even I’m slightly moved.” Meng Wei laughed bitterly and sighed. “That’s Dao Insight. Besides the wise men from our Ninth Hell Clan during the primeval times, who has comprehended it in such a long period of time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He faintly had a feeling that perhaps this little bit of ability Chen Xi revealed at this moment was nothing to Chen Xi, but to their Ninth Hell tribe, it wasn’t inferior to opening the door to a new world before their eyes, and it caused them to feel unprecedented shock and longing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Meng Wei himself couldn’t help but be feel admiration and even arouse a trace of anticipation. He wanted to see what enormous changes would occur in the Ninth Hell tribe under this outsider’s leadership.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If…” Mo Ya spoke abruptly. Her snow white teeth bit her red and moist lips lightly while she carried an indeterminate expression, and she gritted her teeth and said after a short while, “I’m saying if this fellow is able to allow all our clansmen to comprehend Dao Insight, then I’ll submit to him, acknowledge him as Chieftain, and absolutely not disobey him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei laughed bitterly as he shook his head and said, “Even if it was during the primeval times, grasping Dao Insights required comprehension ability and natural talent. Isn’t your condition too harsh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Harsh? Hmph! I don’t think so.” Mo Ya grunted lightly from her nostrils. Her figure was hot, slender, and graceful, and her jet black ponytail swung in an elegant arc under the light breeze, causing her to seem beautiful and charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei was stunned and was about to speak when the sound of Chen Xi teaching suddenly entered his ears, causing his expression to instantly turn serious as he started to listen attentively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi couldn’t help but smile and struck while the iron was hot. He started to explain what Dao Insights were and how one should comprehend and grasp this sort of energy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The comprehension ability of all these young children was extremely outstanding, but their knowledge of Dao comprehension was exceedingly deficient, and they were like blank pieces of paper. In other words, what they lacked was knowledge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had to obtain knowledge about this world and obtain knowledge about some basic techniques cultivators had to grasp when seeking the Heaven Dao. For example, the differentiation between the levels of martial techniques and Divine Abilities, the comprehension and utilization of Dao Insight, the difference between body refinement and qi refinement, and so on and so forth…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simply speaking, they had to obtain knowledge about the difference between the systems of cultivation, and the various information contained within the various cultivation systems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the three dimensions, all this was the most basic knowledge that was practically general knowledge. Every single cultivator would know this by heart before they even started cultivating, and there was utterly no need for anyone to teach them all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But to these people that had been forgotten in the Ninth Hell, these things were things that they desperately needed to grasp. Otherwise, even if they were able to leave this place successfully and arrive in the outside world, they would be unable to fit in and would find it impossible to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through his observation during these past few days, Chen Xi had already deeply understood this. So he didn’t directly pass down any formidable cultivation techniques when teaching these young children, and he spoke from the most basic cultivation systems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was warm and clear, and he used terms that were clear, easy to understand, and filled with wit. He didn’t blindly imbue them with knowledge, but displayed the meaning of what he spoke of through various vivid methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of Xiao Yan and the other young children were wide open while they carried serious and attentive expressions, and they were fascinated by what Chen Xi spoke of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those youths that lay prone outside the fence held their breaths in concentration. None of them spoke another word as all of them have given their entire attentions to what Chen Xi was speaking about, and it seemed as if a window had been opened before them, allowing them to see another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The miraculous Laws of the Heaven Dao existed within the perfected cultivation systems of this world, and these cultivation systems were numerous like the stars in the milky way. A perfect and precise cultivations system contained spirit medicine, pill refinement, equipment refinement, puppets, and various other knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this was strange and unusual, gorgeous and vast, and it caused their hearts to surge from hearing this while they pondered swiftly and almost forgot their own existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Meng Wei and Mo Ya had fallen into silence as well. Chen Xi’s voice was like the sound of nature, and it plucked their heartstrings, causing them to be carried far away and be unable to restrain themselves.</span></p>
