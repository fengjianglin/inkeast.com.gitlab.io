He noticed that once they started moving, those youths would seem as if they’d become a different person. Every 10 people formed a team and there was a total of eight teams. All of them had vigilant expressions and strong postures as they guarded the sides of the group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single move they made was uniform and highly disciplined, and they seemed like an army. Even though there were only a few of them, they revealed the aura of elites who’d experienced hundreds of battles.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, if this army completely consisted of sword cultivators, what extent would its offensive strength attain?</span></p>

So the side with the more experts would occupy the advantageous position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Practically no one had thought about organizing cultivators into an army, utilizing discipline to restrain them and orders to direct them, and it was to use a whole to replace individuals and undergo a new form of battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thought was that the disposition of cultivators was too undisciplined as they pursued freedom and being unrestrained. So unless it was a command of their seniors in the sect, they would utterly not obey the orders of anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with the higher a cultivator’s cultivation gets, the stronger the might the cultivator grasped, they were capable of plucking the moon from the sky, overturning oceans, and annihilating a city in the blink of an eye, so they utterly looked down upon a group battle method like an army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So up until now, it was practically impossible to see an army made of cultivators in the cultivation world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi didn’t think like this. In his opinion, 10 Violet Palace Realm cultivators might not be able to defeat a Golden Hall Realm cultivator. But if these 10 Violet Palace Realm cultivators were organized into a team that were provided with similar magic treasures and obtained excellent and effective training that allowed them to tacitly cooperate with each other from a distance. In this way, even if they were unable to defeat a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, it was sufficient to draw the enormous gap between them closer, and it wouldn’t be impossible for it to end in a draw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that Chen Xi was imagining how if he was able to reorganize Earthly Immortal Realm experts, or even Heavenly Immortals and gods into armies, then they would absolutely be capable of sweeping through the myriad of worlds in the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until the moment the group set up camp, Chen Xi was still deducing all this, and he seemed as if he’d fallen into madness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Chen Xi, it’s time to teach us how to train.” Suddenly, the snotty kid ran over and spoke while sucking his finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi instantly returned to his senses. When he raised his eyes to look over, he noticed that those young children were already waiting at the center of the campsite, and it wasn’t just them, even those youths were standing there while waiting for him to teach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the first lesson ended yesterday, these youths had already been subdued by Chen Xi’s deep and profound knowledge, and they stopped going against him and had started to try to accept him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene before him was the best example.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These youths had travelled for an entire day, yet even though they were exhausted, they were still unable to conceal their excitement when they recalled everything from yesterday, so they charged over at the first possible moment with the intention of receiving Chen Xi’s guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi wasn’t surprised by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From this lesson onward, I intend to change the method of training. It’ll be able to make all of you become even more strong in a short period of time, do you want to learn it?” Chen Xi swept all those youths with his gaze as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Everyone replied in unison without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded and started to re-organize them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a total of 76 youths and 13 young children, and their cultivations weren’t uniform. The only thing they had in common was that all of them were body refiners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Chen Xi’s arrangement, all these youths and young children were temporarily divided into two batches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One batch was formed from those suitable to body refinement and occupied 60 people, and they were named the Violet Lightning Camp. All of them were youths older than 12 and below 15 years of age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other batch was formed from those suitable to qi refinement and occupied 29 people, and they were named the Azurefrost Camp. It consisted of those 13 young children and 16 youths around the age of 10.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before long, Chen Xi divided the 60 youths of the Violet Lightning Camp into three small teams. Every single team consisted of 20 people and they each selected a team leader that were respectively Blackie, Scarface, and Baldy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the Azurefrost Camp was similarly divided into three teams. Two teams of 10 and one team of nine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Chen Xi had tried to carry out this type of army organizing. It didn’t go too smoothly in the beginning, but along with the organizing of teams being carried out ceaselessly, the light in Chen Xi’s eyes grew even brighter as his actions became more systematic, causing his organization of groups to become gradually smoother. At the same time, an aura of confidence silently effused out from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t a sudden impulse, because doing this would firstly be able to fully utilize the discipline these youths had formed since a long time ago, and secondly, it allowed him to teach them according to their aptitudes and allow them to bring forth their potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, a messy team gradually took shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s he doing?” Mo Ya frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, the lesson from yesterday had made her view of Chen Xi change greatly but seeing him not teaching properly but actually organizing teams as if he was playing a game caused her to instantly feel slight displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps he has another objective. He’s someone from the outside world, and his knowledge is far from something we can compare to. Mo Ya, there’s no need to get too flustered, just watch silently from the side,” said Meng Wei with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! It’s so strange. It’s truly inconceivable! I wonder if everyone in the outside world is like him.” Mo Ya puckered her lips. Even though she spoke like this, her gaze didn’t leave Chen Xi for a moment because she was similarly curious about what he would be able to achieve by doing this.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” A single sentence had drawn out the yearning of these youths to become stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright! My requirement is extremely simple. Not only must all of you become stronger yourselves, you must even help those in your team and battle camp to become stronger! Only in this way would all of you be able to obtain all of this!” Chen Xi’s gaze was like bolts of lightning, and he held his hands behind his back while his back remained ramrod straight, causing him to carry an impressive and dignified manner. “I on the other hand will set up some rewards, and I’ll distribute the rewards to all of you based on the overall performance of your respective groups. The group with the best performance will be able to obtain an additional prize, and the group with the worst performance will suffer punishment instead!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Chen Xi flicked his sleeve, causing a ray of light to flash before a large pile of spirit pills that seemed like a tiny hill appeared on the ground. These spirit pills flowed with the glow of treasures, were suffused with spirit energy, and emitted a refreshing fragrance that was intoxicating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Medicinal pills!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Supposedly, these medicinal pills carried various exceedingly miraculous effects after they’re consumed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the youths were instantly stared wide open and become extremely burning while their breathing became heavy as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the distant Meng Wei, Mo Ya, and those guards that protected the surroundings of the campsite opened their eyes wide with disbelief as they looked at the scene before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were too shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could they have imagined that Chen Xi actually carried so many spirit pills in his possession?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was extremely pleased with their reaction because one could only be persistent when one wanted something, and then he said, “All of these are merely a small portion of the rewards, and they’re far from being considered anything significant. So long as all of you put on an outstanding display, I’ll give all of you even more generous rewards!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s merely a small portion?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely a single sentence was like a piece of bait that was impossible to refuse, and it drew out the yearning in the deepest depths of their hearts, causing the to be excited to the point their eyes glimmered with greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Moreover, after a period of time, the Violet Lightning Camp and Azurefrost Camp will decide a victor amongst them. At that time, I’ll personally prepare a pleasant surprise that none of you will expect, and it will be given to the winner!” Chen Xi’s words were like a stone that caused a thousand ripples, and he made all these youths seethe with excitement. Their hot blood burned as they rubbed their palms together, and they truly wished for nothing more than to have a battle right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, I have to remind all of you that you can stop at nothing when dealing with your enemies, but you absolutely can’t do that to your companions!” Chen Xi’s expression suddenly became cold as he said with a low voice, “Remember, competition is competition, but if anyone dares to do something that’s harmful to another in secret for the sake of some rewards, then don’t blame me for being ruthless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he’d temporarily lost his cultivation, the impressive and dignified manner Chen Xi had tempered from the blood and flames of battles during all these years was still present, and the oppressive deterrent force in his voice was something that anyone could feel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths seemed as if they were doused with cold water, and they instantly returned to their senses.&nbsp;</span></p>

We only have our clansmen in the tribe, and we’ll absolutely not do things such as fighting each other!” Stone who possessed calmness and maturity that far exceeded his age replied in a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right! We’ll absolutely not fight each other!” The other youths shouted loudly as well with firm expressions that revealed stubbornness and resolution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright! Then all of you must remember what you’ve said today. Not only must all of you remember it now, but even if you enter the outside world in the future, you must firmly remember these words!” said Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths didn’t say anything further, and they puckered their lips while nodding fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Mo Ya’s beautiful brows knit together as she spoke with displeasure. “This fellow is simply making trouble out of nothing. How could he speak like that about our clansmen? When have the members of our Ninth Hell tribe even fought each other?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei seemed to be lost in thought instead, and his eyes were suffused with a wisp of appreciation as he said, “Chen Xi has done well because it’s always wise to be safe. The outside world is unlike the Ninth Hell we reside in, and it’s filled with various temptations, and Chen Xi did this for the sake of those little fellows. He wants them to understand that no matter what temptation they face, the lives of their clansmen and companions are the most precious!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
