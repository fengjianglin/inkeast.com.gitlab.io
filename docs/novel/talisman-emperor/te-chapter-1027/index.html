 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being swept by this gaze caused both of them who’d just cried out in shock to seem as if they’d been doused with a bucket of cold water, and their entire bodies trembled while they felt a terrifying aura of danger, causing their voices to stop abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both of you recognize me?” Chen Xi spoke with an icy cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The events that had occurred at the Azuresoul Mine had only occurred a few hours ago, so the two of them had probably not found out about it so quickly. However, based on their reactions from before, they seemed to have heard his name a long time ago, and this was slightly strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he recovered from his shock, the thin middle aged man couldn’t help but get angry from the embarrassment he felt from being terrified to the point of trembling by a little fellow that had just ascended a few days ago, and he immediately said in an icy cold voice, “Presently, there’s probably no one in the Eastern Peace Continent that doesn’t know your name! Because you’re a villain that the Immortal Monarch’s Estate ordered the arrest of!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he slapped the table and stood up before he shouted. “Chen Xi, quickly allow yourself to be captured! If you still refuse to realize your errors, then don’t blame us for being merciless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you had the intention to return here to obtain a Immortal Token, it proves that your inherent nature isn’t bad. Now, perhaps you’ll be able to avoid suffering of the flesh if you stay here obediently.” The old man stood up with an icy cold expression on his face, and he revealed indifference that seemed as if he was looking down at a prisoner that was at their mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of attitude was simply exactly similar to the treatment Chen Xi encountered when he’d just arrived at the Ascension Hall a few days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if in the eyes of these two people, all ascenders could be ordered about and were like slaves that were at their beck and call and had to listen obediently to their orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This proved that they were really unaware of the incident in the Azuresoul Mine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a terrifying aura that was like an abyss stretched out from Chen Xi’s body, and it was like a primeval ferocious beast had awakened in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The table was unable to endure the pressure of this imposing aura and transformed into bits that shot towards the surroundings. On the other hand, the figures of the thin middle aged man and old men were shaken as if a mountain was pressing down onto them, causing them to take numerous steps back while emitting resounding stomps, and their figures staggered as they almost fell to the ground. They were in an extremely sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their countenance was already ghastly pale and filled with terror and disbelief instead. They seemed to have never imagined that after a short few days of time, this ascender would actually possess such a terrifying imposing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, the thin middle aged man cried out sharply. “What are you thinking of doing? We’re members of the Cloudray Sect. If you dare use force against us, then my Cloudray Sect will absolutely not let you off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s expression remained unchanged as he raised his hand and swung it, causing &nbsp;a shapeless slap to strike fiercely on the middle aged man’s face. It struck him to the point blood sprayed from his mouth and nose, and he fell to the ground while emanating a shrill cry that sounded like a pig that was being slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… How audacious!” The old man was both shocked and furious as he shouted angrily with a grim voice. “Doing this will only cause you to fall into eternal damnation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his voice was forceful, yet his attitude had already weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll give both of you a chance to atone for your sins. Obediently tell me everything all of you know, and I’ll spare your lives.” As Chen Xi’s eyes blinked, strands of the Laws surged like bolts of lightning within them, and his gaze suddenly descended onto the old man as he said, “I’ll give both of you three breaths of time to consider.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sort of attitude was extremely domineering, and he didn’t give them the slightest room to maneuver, causing the nearby Mu Linglong to be extremely astounded in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she really detested these two people, so she naturally wouldn’t speak on their behalf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How presumptuous!” The thin middle aged man stood up and stared resentfully at Chen Xi, and he was just about to speak yet was forcefully stopped by the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he looked at Chen Xi with a livid expression and said, “We’re only two nobodies that are in-charge of receiving ascenders, so we probably know very little about what you desire to find out.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s very simple. Tell me why I’ve become wanted in the Eastern Peace Continent for no reason or rhyme?” Chen Xi asked with an indifferent tone. Actually, he had a vague answer in his heart because since the time he’d killed Huang Xin, Huang Xin had said that all of this was done by the Immortal Monarch, Lin Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that for the sake of capturing him, Immortal Monarch Lin Hao had deployed numerous experts to capture all the ascenders that had just ascended into the territory of the Eastern Peace Continent, and he seemed to act ruthlessly as if he would rather kill a thousand innocents than let his target escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi was bewildered because he was utterly unable to figure out exactly when he’d incurred enmity with the Immortal Monarch, Lin Hao, and that was the reason why he’d asked this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…actually don’t know?” The old man was stunned, and he seemed to feel slight disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi said coldly, “It’s I who is asking you the questions.” His voice carried a wisp of impatience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This was the order of Immortal Monarch Lin Hao. It was roughly a month ago when all the 86,000 cities in the entirety of Eastern Peace Continent received this order, and it was an order to capture all the ascenders that arrived in the Immortal Dimension during this period of time.” When he saw Chen Xi arouse a trace of killing intent, the old man’s countenance turned pale before he hurriedly said, “It was only a few days ago that we found out the reason Immortal Monarch Lin Hao had mobilized so many forces was actually for the sake of capturing you. We have no knowledge of anything other than that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s brows knit together. Even though he’d guessed that it was impossible for the two of them to know everything with their status, he couldn’t help but be slightly disappointed when he heard the old man’s answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he pondered deeply for a long time, Chen Xi said, “Forget it. I’ll spare both of you this time. Give me that Immortal Token.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thin middle aged man and old man heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts, and they understood that they’d temporarily escaped calamity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when they heard Chen Xi demanding for an Immortal Token, the old man’s expression couldn’t help but reveal shock as he said, “Fellow Daoist, even though an Immortal Token is of no great use, it’s in compliance with the laws of the Immortal Dimension, so names and origins can’t be written arbitrarily. If one does this, it’s equivalent to abandoning one’s identity as an Immortal, and it might cause a calamity of the Laws of the Heaven Dao to descend when one advance in cultivation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he smiled spuriously as he said, “Do you think I would change my name to avoid Immortal Monarch Lin Hao’s order?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was clearly aware that it was exactly as the old man had said. An Immortal Token couldn’t be fabricated because it was equivalent to deceiving the energy of the Laws that circulated in the Immortal Dimension, and it wasn’t tolerated by the Heaven Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man smiled embarrassedly. “Of course not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the nearby Mu Linglong couldn’t refrain herself from speaking. “That Immortal Monarch Lin Hao is too detestable. He actually disregarded his identity to make a move against Young Master Chen Xi and even ordered for Young Master’s arrest in an entire continent. This is simply an act of bullying the weak, and it’s despicable and shameless to the extreme.”</span></p>

She actually dares to bluntly criticize Immortal Monarch Lin Hao as despicable. This is truly a great disrespect! If news of this were to be spread, she wouldn’t even know how she died.</span></p>

How dare you not show respect to you elders!?” However, right at this moment, someone seemed to have heard Mu Linglong and suddenly let out a cold grunt. This voice was icy cold and carried bone piercing coldness, and it bore into their ears like an awl of ice, causing the old man and middle aged man to shudder while their faces turned pale.</span></p>

This person seemed to have merged with the heavens and the earth, and every single move the person made was accompanied by the Laws while he revealed an oppressive imposing might. This person was on par with King Chu Jiang, King Song Di, and the other Golden Immortals that Chen Xi had met in the past!</span></p>
