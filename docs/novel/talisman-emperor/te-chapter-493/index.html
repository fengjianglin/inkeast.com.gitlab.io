 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-e335f942-a16f-323f-5bc6-18160c3a6f33"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place was a valley that was extremely common in the Primeval Battlefield, with winding and flowing clear streams that emitted gurgling and melodious sounds. Clusters of wild flowers grew on the stream’s banks while multicolored butterflies fluttered about, causing the scene to be rather elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sat cross-legged by the river bank and was organizing the various materials in his possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of battle, he was still most skilled in the Sword Dao, but the current might of the Talisman Armament was obviously incapable of satisfying his requirements in battle, so he intended to refine the Talisman Armament once more in the near future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’re you doing?” Huangfu Qingying had a smile on her face as she walked over. Her dress fluttered in the wind as her body swayed, causing her graceful and slender body to reveal shocking charm as she sat by Chen Xi’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m organizing my things. I intend to refine my sword a little bit.” Chen Xi replied casually. Presently, he’d already gathered all the materials, and all he lacked was to carry out the refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Talisman Armament was different from an ordinary magic treasure, it possessed infinite space for improvement, and if its quality improved a step further, its might would be entirely capable of comparing with a Quasi Immortal Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the refining process was extremely difficult and troublesome, and it was even to the extent that a slight mistake could possibly destroy all the materials. For the sake of avoiding such a situation from occurring, Chen Xi had to first thoroughly figure out the attributes of each material and organize them before he could take the next step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw Chen Xi concentrated on the various materials before him, Huangfu Qingying puckered her lips as she smiled, then she didn’t disturb him any further before quietly sitting by his side, and this action caused her to feel extremely relaxed in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they were in the Darchu Dynasty before this, she hadn’t paid much attention to Chen Xi because as the daughter of Emperor Chu, it was utterly impossible for her to pay attention to Chen Xi as well, and it was only when the Allstar Meeting began that she saw Chen Xi for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, she felt it was a matter of course that Chen Xi was an insignificant follower of her Big Sister Ya Qing. Coupled with Ya Qing asking her to take care of Chen Xi on numerous occasions later on, she felt that not only was Chen Xi a follower of Ya Qing’s, he was even a fellow that depended on women and specialized in taking advantage of her Big Sister Ya Qing, causing her to be rather unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, now, she wouldn’t think like this, and it could even be said that she was the one that depended on Chen Xi now and was protected by him all the time. Even she hadn’t realized that Chen Xi had already become the friend that she trusted the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, he has too many women…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she tilted her head to stare at the side of Chen Xi’s face that had a manly outline, the peerlessly beautiful appearance of Qing Xiuyi, Fan Yunlan, Ya Qing, and the other women flashed unconsciously in Huangfu Qingying’s mind, and she sighed faintly in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These women were either peerlessly beautiful like celestial maidens that had descended to the world or gorgeous and seductive with extraordinary allure. Every single one of them was so extraordinary, so outstanding, and when compared with them, even with Huangfu Qingying’s pride, she had to admit that no matter which aspect it was, she was unable to stand above all of them and would at most be on par with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has Qinghe still not returned?” Chen Xi’s voice suddenly sounded out by her ear, and it jolted awake Huangfu Qingying from her disordered thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was stunned for a moment before she shook her head and smiled. “No. Six hours have already passed, I wonder to what extent has he tortured Hong Zhuo? But it’s good for him to vent it as well. If it was me, I would absolutely not kill Hong Zhuo so easily either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they were speaking, a wave of footsteps resounded out from afar, and Zhao Qinghe and Young Master Zhou walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Qinghe’s expression was cold and calm, and merely from his outward appearance, one could perceive a relaxed expression from completely venting the hatred and resentment in his heart, whereas Young Master Zhou beside him had a horrified expression instead, and he seemed to have been provoked by something, causing his gaze to carry a trace of a strange expression when he looked at Zhao Qinghe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How was it?” Chen XI stood up and asked with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t kill him. He said he wanted me to be unable to have a proper death for eternity, so I want him to have a taste of it.” Zhao Qinghe flipped his palm and a translucent treasure that seemed like a crystal appeared on it, and Chen Xi could clearly see that Hong Zhuo’s Soul Core was confined within it while roaring and struggling hysterically with an extremely miserable appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Zhou seemed to have recalled some sort of terrible scene when he heard this, causing him to seem as if he wanted to vomit, yet was unable to, and he was like that for a long time before squeeze out a few words. “This fellow is too disgusting. I don’t want to see how he tortures others ever again even if I have to die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying was instantly stunned. Since Young Master Zhou could become disgusted to such an extent, it was obvious that the method of torture this fellow Zhao Qinghe used was extremely brutal and horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t pay attention to all this instead, and he only suggested. “Allowing his Soul Core to exist seems as if he’s suffering torment at all times, yet it’s actually giving him a slight chance of survival. What if his Soul Core is rescued? He would be entirely capable of seizing another’s body to be reborn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Qinghe was stunned, and he nodded as he said, “I didn’t consider this, I’ll annihilate him right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head and said, “Don’t. If you think you haven’t finished venting your anger, then how about allowing his Soul Core to seize the body of an animal, and then wipe out his mental capabilities? It wouldn’t be a bad idea to make him stay forever with animals before perishing on his own.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Making the dignified Crown Prince of the Darqian Dynasty seize the body of an animal and without any mental capability…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou couldn’t help but shudder in unison when they heard this, and only now did they notice that if it was in terms of skill in torture, Chen Xi was even more horrifying and cruel than Zhao Qinghe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this suggestion caused Zhao Qinghe to smile with satisfaction instead, and he flashed right away towards the valley. It wasn’t long before he slowly led a drooling beast over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The drooling beast’s appearance was hideous, it had a fat body and a wide mouth filled with protruding teeth, and its entire body emitted an extremely stinky mucus, causing it to be extremely disgusting. It was a type of common demon beast within the Primeval Battlefield, and even though it was weak, no one would make a move against it. It couldn’t be helped, it was truly too smelly, so not to mention possessing any materials that could be utilized, even its flesh was stinky to the point of being able to stink a person to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, Zhao Qinghe had sealed Hong Zhuo’s Soul Core within this beast’s body before wiping out its mental capability, causing it to have an idiotic appearance and be entirely incapable of recognizing Chen Xi and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhuo couldn’t help but shudder again when they saw this scene, and they couldn’t help but rejoice in their hearts that they weren’t the enemies of Chen Xi and Zhao Qinghe, otherwise it would be too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of being worried about the safety of Zhen Liuqing and Qing Xiuyi, Chen Xi and the others didn’t continue staying here, and they flashed up into the air before flying towards the teleportation formation in the northwest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the way, Chen Xi was extremely moved when he found out that Zhao Qinghe had been ambushed by Hong Zhuo and the others while coming to save him, and he never expected that this fellow who had an outward appearance that was cold like a rock would actually be so considerate and warmhearted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when he heard that not only had Lu Xiao who came to save him died because of him, Lu Xiao had even died at the hands of Huangfu Changtian, Chen Xi’s expression instantly sank, and he felt both guilty and furious in his heart. Moreover, this extremely complicated feelings almost provoked him to the point of losing control of his killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and Young Master Zhou were similarly furious to the extreme, as they never imagined that Huangfu Changtian would actually assist their enemies and help an outsider to harm their own companions. Such despicable and shameless actions were simply unforgivable and deserving of death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, I forgot something. After Huangfu Changtian caused the death of Lu Xiao, he was sent by Hong Zhuo to gather with the members of the Darxuan Dynasty with the intention of using his jade token once again to harm the other members of our Darchu Dynasty.” Zhao Qinghe suddenly seemed to have thought of something, and his face went grim as he spoke swiftly.</span></p>

Killing Lu Xiao isn’t enough, and he still wants to harm the others?” Huangfu Qingying’s eyes stared wide open like saucers, and she was angered to the point her entire body trembled because she never expected that this fellow would actually be despicable to such an extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That bastard really deserves death! Does he think he can run wild just because he attached himself to a first-rate Dynasty?” Young Master Zhou gnashed his teeth as he said, “If news of this is sent back to the Darchu Dynasty, then the Wise King’s Estate will become the public enemy of the entire cultivation world within a single day and exterminating the Wise King’s Estate can only be considered to be letting them off easily.”</span></p>

He knew that it was useless no matter how furious he got at this moment, and the pressing matter at the moment was to swiftly discover Huangfu Changtian’s whereabouts before eliminating this black sheep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Qinghe frowned and pondered deeply for a long time before he said, “There’s only less than three months before the final test of the Primeval Battlefield, so the members of the Darxuan Dynasty would have already started rushing towards Primeval City for sure. If my guess isn’t wrong, then Huangfu Changtian has probably gone over there.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Calamities rarely do come alone. Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing have joined up with the disciples of a Prestigious Clan from an Ancient Kingdom, and their fate is unknown. Now, a black sheep like Huangfu Changtian has appeared. The situation has undoubtedly become even more serious than I thought.</span></p>

When bathed in the hazy rays of light, it emitted a strange spatial tremor that caused the surrounding space to seem as if it had warped.</span></p>

He’d indeed heard of teleportation formations in the past, yet it was the first time he saw one with his own two eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, Chen Xi? All of you are here as well!” Right when Chen Xi was sizing up the teleportation formation, a few streaks flashed over from afar once more, and one of the people amongst these streaks couldn’t help but cry out with pleasant surprise upon noticing Chen Xi and the others.</span></p>
