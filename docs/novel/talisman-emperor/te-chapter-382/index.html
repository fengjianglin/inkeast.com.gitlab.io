 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-e16a39a7-35ff-ddee-c9d1-3979e0988c98"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Martial Dao Domain, central area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While still another 3km away from this place, Chen Xi saw a boundlessly vast ancient square standing there. It was covered in mottled and lusterless black stones that seemed to have experienced the erosion of countless of years, and it was suffused with an ancient feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were already numerous figures standing around the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s gaze swept past those figures before finally descending at the center of the square. At that place was a very ordinary sacrificial altar that was completely constructed from stone and clay, yet it emitted a unique aura that was ancient and desolate as if people of ancient times had once made sacrifice to the heavens here, and it emanated a sacred energy that struck directly towards one’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the sacrificial altar, Chen Xi recalled the Nine Dragon Sacrificial Altar he’d seen in Silken City for no reason or rhyme, and he faintly felt as if there was some sort of connection between the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful. After the 3,600 Martial Dao Tokens are taken, 100 Martial Dao Divine Thrones will appear on this square.” Fan Yunlan’s voice sounded out by his ears. “The divine thrones would emerge with that sacrificial altar at the center and be distributed out layer by layer. At that time, the 3,600 cultivators would start seizing the divine thrones. The closer the divine throne to the sacrificial altar, the more people would be competing for it, causing it to be extremely intense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi slowed down greatly as he said with surprise, “Could it be that there’s importance in the distribution of the divine thrones?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not too sure about this as well. But according to the experience from the previous Allstar Meetings, the closer the divine throne is to the sacrificial altar, the quality of the Dao Grade martial technique obtained would be extremely formidable. So, it’s probably because of this.” Fan Yunlan replied in a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did Chen Xi suddenly come to an understanding, and the two of them stopped not too far away from the square. At this moment, there were already young disciples of numerous sects residing in the surrounding of the square, and Chen Xi saw many familiar faces amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi, Zhao Qinghe, Huangfu Changtian, Zhen Liuqing, Huangfu Qingying, Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, and so on and so forth. These peak experts of unparalleled talent in the younger generation were divided into different groups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind these experts that seemed like proud geniuses of the heavens were the disciples of their respective sects, causing them to form a large assembly of talents which were a formidable force, and the place they occupied was extremely far in front and the best places around the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst them, only Zhao Qinghe and Zhen Liuqing were alone. But their strengths were formidable to the extreme, so no one dared say anything as they stood at the positions in the extreme front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw so many familiar faces, Chen Xi couldn’t help but recall everything he’d gone through during these past few years, and mixed feelings welled up in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, he’d always been pursued after by some of the people amongst them and was forced to flee for his life in a state of panic like a dog with its tail between its legs, and just thinking about it caused him to sigh endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, everything was different. After experiencing countless arduous struggles in these past few years, the strength he possessed now already allowed him to have no need of fearing anyone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother, that kid has arrived as well.” Even though Chen Xi and Fan Yunlan kept an extremely low profile when they arrived, they still drew the attention of some of the people nearby, and Huangfu Chongming was amongst them. When he saw Chen Xi, his expression instantly became gloomy as piercingly cold killing intent was emitted from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby Huangfu Changtian stood with his hands behind his back, and he thoughtlessly swept Chen Xi with his gaze when he heard this. After that, he withdrew his gaze and focused on the sacrificial altar at the center of the square as he said indifferently, “Comparatively speaking, seizing the Martial Dao Divine Thrones are the thing I’m most concerned about. But that kid will probably join in as well. At that time, you can join forces with the others and deal with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Chongming nodded and said, “I naturally understand this. Big Brother’s opponents are Qing Xiuyi, Zhao Qinghe, and the others. Just leave the other things to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Changtian patted his younger brother’s shoulder as he said, “Please don’t be impetuous. Don’t lose your position on a Martial Dao Divine Throne because of him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother, just be at ease.” Huangfu Chongming smiled. Even though Chen Xi’s current strength couldn’t be compared to before, he was extremely confident in making Chen Xi’s footsteps go no further than here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he wished for nothing more than to kill Chen Xi, and it wasn’t just him. The nearby Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, and the others took Chen Xi as a thorn in their eyes. Thus, so long as he joined forces with all of them, it would be sufficient for him to easily exterminate Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just as Huangfu Chongming had guessed, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, and the others had noticed Chen Xi’s arrival as well. All of them had icy cold expressions and gazes that contained killing intent, and they didn’t conceal their hatred in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like you have many enemies, and they’re all the top experts of renowned and great sects.” Fan Yunlan seemed to be lost in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi rubbed his nose and smiled indifferently. “Actually, it’s about time to resolve the enmity with them. If they dare make a move, then I’ll be sure receive it. But I’m sure that the one who regrets it in the end will absolutely not be me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words seemed to be flat, yet revealed a resolute and willful feeling, and it even faintly revealed Chen Xi’s strong confidence towards his own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the first time Fan Yunlan had seen Chen Xi reveal such a confident and domineering side, causing her beautiful eyes to be unable to help but be suffused with ripples, and she said after a long time, “If that time comes, then I won’t watch without lending a hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the two of them conversed, there were many people that had arrived here successively, and almost 3,000 cultivators has already converged nearby the square in a dense mass that was a rather magnificent sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As more people arrived, not only did the atmosphere not become bustling, it instead became even heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that for the sake of seizing the mere 100 Martial Dao Divine Thrones, a brutal and bloody fierce battle would surely occur next. At this moment where a storm was brewing, would anyone have the mood to engage in idle chats?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the atmosphere could only be described as having undercurrents brewing in secret and a battle would break out at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was precisely at a time like this that Zhen Liuqing who stood at the extreme front of the square and was the focus of the attention of many had suddenly turned her head to leave the place she stood, and she split apart the crowd as she walked towards the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s a superb location that’s the closest from the sacrificial altar at the center of the square. Why would she leave it so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of their curiosity, their gazes chased after Zhen Liuqing’s figure as they wanted to see what exactly this female disciple of the Mistwater Pavilion, a proud genius of the heavens that was praised by the current Emperor Chu wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, some observant people noticed that it wasn’t just Zhen Liuqing, and at this moment, even the Skyplit Sect’s An Qianyu, the Brightray Sect’s Wang Daoxu, the Zhao Clan’s Fourth Young Master Zhou, the Jadepool Celestial Isle’s Hua Mobei, and the Thunder Marquis Estate’s Young Marquis Wang Zhenfeng were walking towards the same direction as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, at the end of that direction was Chen Xi’s location!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Chen Xi had become the center of attention. He’d noticed the subtle changes in the situation, yet his expression didn’t change in the slightest, and he even had the mood to joke as he smiled to Fan Yunlan who was by his side and said in a low voice, “I forgot to tell you earlier. Besides having numerous enemies, I have numerous friends as well.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yunlan was originally nervous as she thought all these people were Chen Xi’s enemies that intended to make a move against Chen Xi at this moment, and she couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief in her heart. When she looked carefully, she really did notice that all these people held smiles on the corners of their mouths, and they didn’t have the slightest hostility, causing her to instantly be extremely surprised in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like this fellow has been doing well in these past few years!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though I don’t want to admit that you’re my friend, what can I do when you won a Dragonsoul Jade Pendant from me? When this Young Master makes friends, firstly the person must be agreeable to me, and secondly, the person’s strength must obtain my respect. You’ve achieved both of it, so I can only take you as a friend.” Young Master Zhou shook the jade fan in his hand as he laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi smiled. “Should I behave as if I’m overwhelmed by the unexpected favor?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Zhou’s brows raised. “Of course. I have to endure a great deal of pressure from being friends with you. According to my observation, there’re many people present that want to kill you, right? Presently, I’ve stepped forward bravely, and it’s no different from drawing my sword to help you. So you owe me for this and have to treat me to some wine when we’re free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded and said, “Even if you didn’t mention it, I would treat you to some wine, and a single time isn’t enough, we’ll make it ten times. I guarantee to accompany you until you’re satisfied.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, his gaze swept An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, Hua Mobei, and the others, and he said with a smile, “Of course, it can’t do without all of you. At that time, we must drink to our heart’s content and only stop when we’re drunk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone laughed heartily as they nodded in agreement.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This action instantly drew the gazes of many people, and some were jealous, some were puzzled, and even more were envious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was Zhen Liuqing? The proud genius of the Mistwater Pavilion, an existence that was equal to Qing Xiuyi and Huangfu Qingying and possessed both natural talent and beauty, and she was the most perfect companion in the hearts of numerous cultivators. Normally, being able to speak a word to her already caused them to feel extremely happy, and they entirely didn’t dare have too extravagant hopes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was fine if it was always like this. After all, if one and everyone are unable to obtain something, then everyone could get along peacefully. Now, Zhen Liuqing had become so close with Chen Xi, and their relationship looked to be rather ‘intimate,’ so this naturally caused some people to be envious to the point their eyes turned extremely red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw Chen Xi suddenly possess so many supporters, the expressions of the distant Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, Xiao Linger, and the others darkened, and they felt the matter had become slightly troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This just happened to confirm what Chen Xi had said earlier. He possessed many enemies, yet had many friends as well, and if his enemies wanted to harm him, then his friends would naturally stand forward to assist him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, perhaps this friendship contained many things mixed within and wasn’t so pure, yet at least at this moment, they stood on Chen Xi’s side, and this kindness was sufficient to make Chen Xi remember it in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, come over here!” Right at this moment, a clear, melodious, and delicate voice suddenly resounded out from the extreme distance, and when everyone saw who the owner of this voice was, they instantly felt muddleheaded and seemed as if they’d seen a ghost.</span></p>
