 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Astral Whitebale Grand Formation, a slaughter formation that was set up with seventy two immortal swords as the Formation Flags, and a high-rank Darkspirit Grade immortal sword as the foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once this formation was formed, it was capable of linking up with the strength of the stars and cause Astral Whitebale that dispersed the soul, destroyed the body, and was peerlessly overbearing to descend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a wisp of a relaxed expressions suffused the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth when he saw the grand formation take form and Zuoqiu Yin and the other sixty plus members of the Zuoqiu Clan were trapped &nbsp;within it, and he let out a long breath of air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he started pursuing Zuoqiu Yin and the others at the beginning, Chen Xi had started to prepare these Formation Flags. He first deduced the formation repeatedly and refined the immortal swords once more before he inscribed countless complicated talisman markings on them, and then he started to set up everything while pondering about how he should eliminate Zuoqiu Yin and the others in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these past few days, he followed behind Zuoqiu Yin and the others at all times while frequently launching sneak attacks to harass them and grind down their will to fight. All of it was for the sake of this moment, he was lowering their guard before drawing them into this trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Chen Xi had succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he’d paid a great price for this. After all, even though the Dao of Archery was formidable, it exhausted one’s mind greatly. It caused his physical strength to faintly show signs of being unable to endure it, and his countenance had become pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of shocked and furious cries sounded out from afar, and it was emanated by Zuoqiu Yin and the others who were trapped within the grand formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi didn’t hesitate any longer to flash over like a ghost and approached the grand formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thump! Thump!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the bow in Chen Xi’s hand had been drawn repeatedly, and it sounded like a gale brushing through the air or metal and rocks being pierced. The arrow released from the bowstring was like a bolt of lightning that tore through the sky while emanating flowing light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, a few shrill howls suddenly sounded out from within the grand formation, and then numerous violet rays of light tore through the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three died…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi frowned and was slightly dissatisfied. He was clearly aware that the Astral Whitebale Grand Formation was set up in too much of a hurry, so its might was limited. It was unable to trap Zuoqiu Yin and the others for long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So he had to make the best use of all the time he had and kill even more of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thump! Thump! Thump!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a time, the powerful and clear sound of the bowstring rose and fell as arrows tore through the sky and surged into the grand formation. They were like the blade of the reaper that intended to seize the soul and crush hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, roars of rage, shrill cries, and curses frequently resounded from within the grand formation… Moreover, they were accompanied by numerous ear piercing and rumbling explosions that shook the entire heavens and the earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“White light that surged into the sky and the descend of baleful qi. A battle is being carried out over there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of people suddenly raised their heads and looked towards the distant sky from extremely far away in the distance. The person in the lead had thick and ink black brows and a robust figure. As he stood there casually, he was like an overlord that ruled the world and controlled all commoners. He revealed an imposing aura of looking arrogantly down at the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Canghai, it wouldn’t that the members of the Zuoqiu Clan have suffered an assault, right?” Behind the domineering young man was over sixty companions, and one of them spoke in a low voice at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, let’s go over and take a look. The Zuoqiu Clan endured the pain to give up a position of chief teacher in Dao Emperor Academy to our Jiang Clan. Courtesy requires reciprocation, so we should look after them.” The young man in the lead didn’t hesitate in the slightest to wave his hand before leading all of them to rush towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Jiang Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Brother Canghai!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shockingly, this young man was Jiang Canghai! The leading figure of the younger generation from one of the seven great ancient clans, the Jiang Clan! An expert that was ranked at the 6</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position during the first round of the test!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the group behind Jiang Canghai was naturally the disciples of the Jiang Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! If it wasn’t for many seniors of the Dragon Dimension holding positions in Dao Emperor Academy, I couldn’t be bothered to care about that useless Zuoqiu Clan.” In another direction, numerous rays of divine light were tearing through the night sky and flying over. If one looked carefully, those rays of divine light were actually dragons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red Dragons, Violet Dragons, Blue Dragons, Darkice Colossal Dragons, Blackscale Barbaric Dragons… There were more than twenty of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The colossal dragon in the lead was entirely like glass, clear and translucent, and the scales on its entire body emanated a desolate, vast, divine, and grand aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shockingly, it was an emperor of the Dragon Clan, a pure blooded green dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, this green dragon was definitely the leading figure from the Dragon Dimension, Ao Wuming!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were around twenty plus disciples of the Dragon Dimension that had come to participate in Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test, whereas Ao Wuming was the leading figure amongst them. His bloodline was noble and pure, he was an emperor of dragons. Moreover, his strength was shocking to the extreme, and he was ranked at the 5</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position during the first round of the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Wuming, could it be that a senior of our Dragon Clan is on friendly terms with an elder of the Zuoqiu Clan, so we were instructed to come assist the disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan?” A Red Dragon with bright and brilliant scales that were crimson red like flames moved through the sky as he voiced this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“More or less. The Zuoqiu Clan promised that once the matter is accomplished, they’ll return a sacred object of our Dragon Dimension — The Golden Dragonsoul. All of you are aware that a senior of our Dragon Dimension that’s teaching in Dao Emperor Academy is from the Golden Dragon Clan. Even I have to comply with his instructions.” Ao Wuming explained with a booming voice, yet his voice carried a slight bit of displeasure. It seemed like if he had a choice, he wouldn’t be willing to bother about this matter either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, look, quickly! White light is surging into the sky there! There seems to be a battle there!” A Darkice Colossal Dragon spoke with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, let’s go take a look!” Ao Wuming instructed, and then his figure swayed before he dove over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our Wenren Clan seems to be on par with the forces of the Zuoqiu Clan, yet we’re inferior to the Zuoqiu Clan in terms of resources and reserves. Don’t look down on this difference because it might be like the difference between an Immortal King and a Half-step Immortal King.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of young men and young women rode on a treasured vessel that flew in midair at an extremely swift speed. They moved 500km in an instant and seemed to be practically teleporting. Obviously, it was a precious treasure at the Cosmic Grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, since they dared to fly freely within the sky of the Bloodlands, it was obviously sufficient to prove that this group of men and women weren’t afraid of being struck by a surprise attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Assisting the disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan this time is equivalent to forming goodwill between our Wenren Clan and the Zuoqiu Clan. It’s quite beneficial to us when we enter into Dao Emperor Academy.” The thin white clothed young man that stood at the bow said indifferently, “After all, if it’s in terms of influence within Dao Emperor Academy, then even if it’s amongst the seven great ancient clans, very few are able to compare with the Zuoqiu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man was called Wenren Xiao, and he was the leading figure of the Wenren Clan’s younger generation. He was ranked at the 13</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position during the first round of the test, and he was an extremely formidable expert as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were around forty young men and young women behind him, and they were naturally the elite disciples of the Wenren Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After all of you enter Dao Emperor Academy, you’ll all understand why they’re called the seven ancient clans. They absolutely deserve their reputations.” Wenren Xiao didn’t speak any further after saying this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, all the young men and women behind him revealed slightly serious expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh! A battle is being carried out ahead! It’s the clansmen of the Zuoqiu Clan!” A young man spoke abruptly. His eyes were suffused with a golden light that seemed like a blade, and it emanated strands of peerlessly fierce rays of light. It was a type of technique that was attained via natural talent — the Realitybreak Goldeyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go! Quickly!” Wenren Xiao’s eyes narrowed as he urged the treasured vessel on with all his strength, and it transformed into a ray of light that swiftly vanished in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one looked down from the highest point in the sky above the Bloodlands, one would notice that formidable auras were flying over menacingly and were like bolts of lightning coming from the southeast, northwest, and west.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Chen Xi had already hunted around twelve disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He drew the bow and was just about to continue when his heart jerked abruptly, and he swiftly raised his head while the Eye of Divine Truth between his brows emanated a myriad of rays of jet black light before it formed into a picture that revealed various scenes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is it really such a coincidence?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi frowned. He glanced at the Astral Whitebale Grand Formation that was on the verge of collapse before taking a glance at the surroundings. In the end, he put the bow away and left decisively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the twelve Zuoqiu Clan disciples that he’d hunted, nine of them had chosen to activate the Violet Ribbon Starcrest at the moment before they fell into a hopeless situation, causing Chen Xi to be unable to obtain their Starpoints, whereas the Starpoints in the possession of the other three were obtained by Chen Xi, and it totaled to over 1,400.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Combined with his gains from before, his current Starpoints had already arrived at a shocking amount of 10,932!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after Chen Xi had just left, numerous figures tore through the sky, and all of them surrounded around the side of the Astral Whitebale Grand Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Jiang Clan?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Wenren Clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dragon Dimension?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as the disciples of these three forces encountered each other, all of them were stunned before they chatted briefly, and then they instantly understood that all of them had come to assist the Zuoqiu Clan, so it didn’t give rise to any trouble between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, taking precautions against each other was unavoidable. After all, this was the Bloodlands, and all of them were rivals. Even disciples of the same sect might fight each other, so how could they be careless?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In next to no time, Zuoqiu Yin and the others escaped their predicament with the help of these three forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they looked at Zuoqiu Yin and the others who were in an extremely sorry state, no matter who it was amongst Jiang Canghai, Wenren Xiao, Ao Wuming, and all the others were extremely shocked in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just Chen Xi alone had actually crushed the Zuoqiu Clan to such an extent, so how could they not be shocked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they wouldn’t think that Zuoqiu Yin and the others were weaklings because it would be impossible for them to have entered the second round of the test and survive until now if that was the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So no one spoke in ridicule towards Zuoqiu Yin and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin had an extremely unsightly, gloomy, and livid expression. &nbsp;Just moments ago, he lost another twelve disciples, and there were only around forty of them left by his side now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the amount of seventy six disciples that the Zuoqiu Clan had when they’d just arrived at the Bloodlands, they’d already lost almost half of their forces, and such losses could be considered to be extremely heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, everyone, for your assistance.” Zuoqiu Yin took a deep breath and forcefully restrained the surging emotions in his heart as he cupped his hands and spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for that.” Jiang Canghai waved his hand in a casual manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Yin, where’s that kid? We received orders before coming here, so we should naturally assist you with all our strength in hunting and killing that young man called Chen Xi.” Wenren Xiao’s tone seemed as if they were bound by common hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! Quickly tell us about it so that we can finish the mission quickly. I still have a lot of things to do.” Compared to Jiang Canghai and Wenren Xiao, Ao Wuming was extremely cold and indifferent. He’d already taken human form, and he was handsome, filled with spirit, had an aloof bearing, and seemed to look down upon all living beings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin was clearly aware that this was the nature of the Dragon Clan. They were extremely arrogant to the bone, and they felt their bloodline was noble and supreme, so they innately possessed a deep sense of superiority.</span></p>
