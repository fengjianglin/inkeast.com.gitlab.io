 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao, Fei Lengcui, the Old Turtle King, the Nine-tailed Fox King, and the others were impressively present. Actually, with the power and authority the Chen Clan possessed now, it was utterly impossible for ordinary figures to enter the Chen Clan main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the gazes of everyone was converged on Chen Xi. Their gazes carried shock, admiration, and respect. Who would have imagined that a young man like this would have become the leading figure in the younger generation of the entire Darchu Dynasty?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many young experts were there in the world? However, since ancient times, how many young experts were capable of attaining such brilliant accomplishments?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the Civil Marquis had once sighed emotionally. There would surely be a genius that shook the heavens in every flourishing age. A genius that crushed everyone in a generation and reigned supreme, a genius that created unprecedented and supreme brilliance. Chen Xi deserved such an honor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was figures of the older generation like Xuan Jing and Qing Qiu, they couldn’t help but feel admiration when facing Chen Xi now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was slightly unable to endure the burning gazes of everyone, and he coughed dryly before he said to the nearby Chen Hao, “His Majesty had already agreed when I left Silken City that so long as the Darchu Dynasty exists, the Chen Clan will never suffer the slightest harm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Chen Xi withdrew a command token. “This is the command token his Majesty bestowed upon our Chen Clan. Hang it before the entrance to the main estate of our Chen Clan after you bind it. At that time, the words, Zhongling, will faintly float in the sky above our entire Chen Clan. Others will know with a single glance that the Chen Clan is personally protected by his Majesty, and if they dare offend the Chen Clan, it would be going against Emperor Chu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Hao was stunned, and then he stretched out his hand to receive it with extreme shock and excitement. “With this command token, the foundation of my Chen Clan will become even more sturdy, and it will surely be able to flourish greatly. Why would we need to worry about the Chen Clan being unable to exist forever with the heavens and the earth?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby Fei Lengcui and the others were shocked and excited to the extreme as well. Zhongling was the name of the current Emperor Chu. A mere two words, yet it represented the supreme will and dignity of Emperor Chu. Who in the Darchu Dynasty would dare offend something that’s personally protected by Emperor Chu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother, how long do you plan to stay?” Chen Hao asked. According to his knowledge, his older brother would have to head to the Primeval Battlefield one year from now, and he was naturally unwilling to part with his older brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t be going anywhere in this year of time. I’ll be staying at home,” said Chen Xi with a smile. Actually, he was unwilling to leave so quickly as well, but the matter couldn’t move according to his will, so he could only seize this short period of a year to properly accompany his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for cultivating, he wasn’t worried about it. He’d experienced the tempering of countless battles during these past few years, and he possessed various comprehensions. Presently, what he needed to do was cultivate with a clear mind and sum up all the experiences he’d obtained, so that he would be able to absorb and digest all the experiences he’d obtained and make preparations to charge into the Rebirth Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In conclusion, no matter if it was for the sake of his family or his own cultivation, Chen Xi didn’t intend to go out to seek tempering and experience during this short period of a single year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good!” Chen Hao said happily, “With Big Brother present, I feel much more relaxed in my heart.” After that he said hesitantly, “Big Brother, doing this won’t affect your cultivation, right? No matter what, your cultivation is still the most important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It won’t.” Chen Xi shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good.” Chen Hao heaved a sigh of relief, and then he suddenly seemed to have thoughts of something. “Big Brother, you rarely return to the clan. Can you meet all the clansmen of our Chen Clan at the square? It won’t take too long, and it’s fine if you just say a few words. Even you know that many people haven’t met you, and they’d always wanted to see you in the flesh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, Chen Hao couldn’t help but start laughing. Presently, the Chen Clan could be considered to be a great and impressive clan in the southern territory’s cultivation world. It possessed over 10,000 clansmen, and most of them had joined the Chen Clan because they admired Chen Xi. But due to Chen Xi rarely returning to the clan and always being outside of the clan gaining experience and tempering, most people still hadn’t seen him in the flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Chen Xi nodded and agreed without the slightest hesitation. Meeting them was a small matter to him, yet it was capable of satisfying the desires of over 10,000 people. Moreover, it was greatly beneficial towards Chen Hao’s control over the Chen Clan in the future, so he naturally wouldn’t refuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, there was already an extremely enormous square constructed within the Chen Clan Estate, and it was specially provided for the clansmen to train. At this moment, the square was filled with a sea of people, and all the members of the Chen Clan had converged here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked at from afar, the entire square was covered in a dense mass of people. There weren’t just disciples and elders present amongst the crowd, even servants had converged over from afar, and they crowded the surroundings of the square to the point it was watertight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s the Grand Elder Chen Xi. I’ve finally seen him in the flesh, I’m so excited!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s so young and only over 20 years of age! How nice would it be if I could marry him…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s really the Grand Elder! My god! I’m able to be so close to such a legendary figure, why do I feel like I’m dreaming?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clansmen of the Chen Clan were excited to the extreme as all their gazes converged onto the tall and extraordinary figure that was on the high platform at the center, and expressions of excitement covered their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Chen Hao and Fei Lengcui standing behind him, Chen Xi swept his gaze towards the surroundings, and it seemed to possess magical powers, causing the square that seemed to be clamorous earlier to suddenly become silent, perfectly silent. It was silent to the point even a dropping needle could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the day I was born, I was given the title of jinx, and I suffered countless ridicule, mockery, aversion, dismissal…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I never looked down upon myself because I firmly believed that so long as I worked hard to persist in what I strived for, the day would come when I would not only be able to change myself, I would even be able to make all those people that rattled about and looked down on me to shut their mouths!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s calm and indifferent voice clearly drifted through the entire square, there wasn’t any strong feelings revealed from his voice, nor did he speak any heroic words, but it was precisely a voice like this that caused the hearts of everyone present to be shocked and resonate with his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeah. All those years ago, the Grand Elder’s fate was infinitely more difficult than mine, yet he was able to obtain the brilliant accomplishments he possesses now. Could it be that it’s merely luck?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course not!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one’s success is obtained casually. The Grand Elder has expended immeasurable amounts of blood and sweat, and he’d even experienced countless dangers and hardships to be able to obtain his current accomplishments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, a wisp of heartfelt admiration couldn’t help but gush out from the hearts of all the Chen Clan clansmen, and it was their respect towards a true expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Presently, I’ve already made it halfway, and I’m working hard for the other half. So long as all of you work hard, you’ll be able to succeed as well. Perhaps your accomplishments would be limited, but you’ll never feel regret since you’ve worked hard for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yet if you don’t work hard, then you’re bound to accomplish nothing in your entire lifetime, and you’ll forever be far away from success!”</span></p>

When one looked up, the sky seemed to have been completely slashed apart by this swing of his sword, and the over 100m wide rift continued on for over 100km, causing it to seem like an enormous chasm that was ripped open by the hands of god.</span></p>
