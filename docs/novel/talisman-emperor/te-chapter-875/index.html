 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clear and resounding sounds of a whip tearing through the sky resounded out within the hall, and it was like the repeated sounds of thunderclaps that shook the eardrums of everyone to the point they felt a sharp pain while the vital blood in their bodies roiled endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the might of an expert at the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Every single whip contained profound and faint energy of the Laws, causing those with inferior strengths to feel as if they were hearing the furious roars of the heavens, and even their souls were affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But compared to this, Mei Luoxiao’s miserable howls were obviously even more shocking. A dignified and superior Heavenly Immortal was an existence that the myriad of beings in the world could only look up towards, yet now, he was like a prisoner that was being flogged. The clothes on his entire body were damaged, his flesh and skin had split apart while his hair was disheveled, and line after line of bloody scars covered his entire body, causing him to seem extremely miserable and wretched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was indeed trying his best to struggle and practically exerted his entire strength, but it was futile in the end. Under Liang Bing’s control, he was utterly unable to escape the predicament of being whipped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Bing’s expression was icy cold while her aura was extremely imposing. She utilized the pitch black whip to a perfect level, and it enveloped and confined the surroundings. Moreover, she remained indifferent no matter how Mei Luoxiao howled with misery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cold and emotionless expression caused the bodies of everyone in the surroundings to go cold and feel as if they’d fallen into an icy pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these sort of circumstances, no one dared to stop her. Even Yu Zhongxia stood stiffly on the spot with an indeterminate and struggling expression, and she didn’t dare try to rescue him even after a long time. Because the difference in strength was too great, and she knew very well that even if she came forward, she would be unable to escape the outcome of being whipped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, it was Ancestor Fei Ling who couldn’t watch on any longer, and he instructed Wen Huating if he could persuade Chen Xi to let Mei Luoxiao off. In any case, Mei Luoxiao was a great figure from the Immortal Dimension and was related to the Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Mei Luoxiao and the others were under orders when they descended to the Mortal Dimension this time, and it was to assist the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in resisting a formidable enemy. It was related to the arrangements of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect during the upheaval of the three dimensions, so if they were to be offended too horribly, they would probably have no face to stay in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating naturally didn’t dare ignore Ancestor Fei Ling’s instruction, and he could only send a voice transmission to Chen Xi. “Chen Xi, I presume you’ve finished venting your anger, so please ask that person to stop. If this is to continue, it would be harmful to the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi acutely noticed that the Sect Master’s attitude towards him was different, and the Sect Master’s voice carried a slight tone of treating him as an equal. Even though this caused him to be surprised, he quickly came to an understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this was because of Liang Bing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, spare him for now,” said Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, you’re just going to let it go like that?” Liang Bing replied with a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she spoke like this, she still quickly stopped attacking, allowing Mei Luoxiao to finally escape calamity. All the clothes on his entire body were in rags, causing him to be practically nude. Moreover, there were numerous scars that were deep to the bone that covered his entire body, causing his appearance to seem extremely wretched and miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shrugged and said helplessly, “My anger is already vented, and if you continue whipping, then it will cost a human life… Oh wait, an immortal’s life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you worried about being unable to gain a foothold in your sect in the future?” Liang Bing seemed as if she thought of something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was speaking true facts because after this matter, Mei Luoxiao, Yu Zhongxia, and all the other seniors in the Immortal Dimension would surely hate Chen Xi to the bone. So once Liang Bing left, then Chen Xi’s situation would probably become extremely bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, even if it the Sect Master, Lie Peng, and the others had the intention to protect him, they would be willing but unable, and this was the true source of all trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely what An Wei was worried about earlier. It was satisfying, but how would Chen Xi deal with the aftermath?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Chen Xi could speak, Liang Bing said, “Leave it to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, her palm flipped before a command token appeared on it, and then she flicked it out towards Yu Zhongxia. From the beginning until the end, she didn’t offer a single word of explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when Yu Zhongxia saw the command token in her hand clearly, her face instantly turned pale while her pupils suddenly constricted as she looked at Liang Bing. She was unable to restrain a wisp of dense fear from appearing on her face, and there was even a wisp of lingering fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if Liang Bing was a dreadful monster, and that command token was explaining how monstrous her authority and strength was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, everyone couldn’t help but look towards the command token as they wanted to see exactly what divine object it was to actually cause a Heavenly Immortal to be afraid to such an extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, it was grabbed and put away by Liang Bing before they could see it clearly. “Since you recognize it, then you ought to understand who can be offended and who can’t.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Zhongxia had a dazed expression before laughing bitterly in the end. She knew that they’d bit off more than they could chew this time, and their hope of taking revenge in their entire lifetimes was extremely tiny…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Chen Xi faintly noticed that the command token was actually very ordinary. The only part of it that wasn’t ordinary was the pattern of a ruler inscribed on its surface and an ancient ‘</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">梁</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">’ character that represented her clan, Liang, written with vigorous strokes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, this command token represented the forces of the Liang Clan in the Immortal Dimension, and it allowed Chen Xi to completely understand that compared to the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in the Immortal Dimension, the Liang Clan was undoubtedly even more enormous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, with Yu Zhongxia’s identity as an emissary of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect that came from the Immortal Dimension, she would absolutely not be terrified to such an extent by a command token.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Yu Zhongxia truly had no face to continue staying here, so she took Mei Luoxiao along as she turned around and left with a dejected and terrified expression. Everyone in the hall couldn’t help but be shocked that Liang Bing was able to torment two Heavenly Immortals to such an extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Ancestor Fei Ling flicked his sleeve and collected up all the profligate disciples from the Immortal Dimension that lay on the ground before he chased after Yu Zhongxia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be helped. Even if they’d lost all face, Yu Zhongxia and the others were still emissaries that had descended from the Immortal Dimension, so he couldn’t be neglectful to them in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely a short moment, the entire hall became quiet once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the gaze Wen Huating and Lie Peng looked at Chen Xi with had changed. It seemed to contain admiration and disbelief, but because Liang Bing was present here, both of them had the tacit understanding to not ask anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t explain Liang Bing’s identity because if nothing unexpected happened, then Liang Bing would leave once he passed down the Immeasurable Virtue technique to her, so there was no need to explain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lie Peng left moments later as he had to head to a concealed place outside the sect to bring back everyone from the West Radiance Peak. Now that everything was settled, it wasn’t right to make all of them continue to suffer injustice outside the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, when those Core Seed Disciples outside the hall noticed that the Sect Master had something to talk about with Chen Xi, they chose to leave as well. They were extremely excited, and they knew that it wouldn’t be long before the news of Chen Xi’s mighty return would shock the entire sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the encounter of those distinguished guests from the Immortal Dimension, it would probably be sealed up. After all, it was too humiliating, and if it were to be spread, it would be harmful to the reputation of the entire Nine Radiance Sword Sect.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master, I remember that people from the Immortal Dimension can’t casually descend to the Mortal Dimension, right? So why would Mei Qingyuan and the others appear in our sect?” Within the spacious hall, Chen Xi spoke about the question that he’d kept in his heart for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating seemed to have expected Chen Xi would ask this, and he explained right away with a warm voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It turned out that during the period of over a year that Chen Xi had left, the figures of Xeno-race experts had appeared repeatedly in the Dark Reverie, causing the powers and sects in the entire world to be anxious and prepare for war. Moreover, there were large scale battles occurring at practically every single moment in the various corners of the Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that the current Dark Reverie was in a state where undercurrents were brewing, and a storm was approaching. Everything seemed like an omen to the upheaval of the three dimensions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially in the past two months, nine Xeno-race Saint Emperors had appeared successively in the southern part of the Dark Reverie, on an uninhabited mountain range 50,000km away from Blaze City. They led countless Xeno-race armies to take cities and seize territory, and not only had they occupied Blaze City, the flames of battle even affected the nearby Heavenly Insight Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During an entire one month of time, the Heavenly Insight Palace that was a power on par with the 10 great immortal sects had actually been captured by the Xeno-race army. The sect was destroyed, its Dao inheritance obliterated, and this incident completely shook the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused the situation in the entire Dark Reverie to become tense, causing all the great sects to start making a move after hearing the news. They either started expanding their territory without restraint, widely recruited disciples, or directly closed the door to their sect and entered into seclusion deep within the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, those small powers and small sects knew they were powerless to resist the Xeno-race army, so they sought protection from the 10 great immortal sects and the six lineages of the demon sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, the entire Dark Reverie revealed a scene of chaos. Powers were fleeing and moving all over the Dark Reverie while extremely horrifying battles could be seen anywhere, causing the world to be covered in a rain of blood and foul winds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this situation where a storm was approaching, the great figures in the Immortal Dimension were unable to sit still because the Dark Reverie was the closest large world to the Immortal Dimension, so once it fell, it would bring an immeasurable threat to the Immoral Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, during the recent period of time, all the extraordinary powers like the 10 great immortal sects and six lineages of the demon sects welcomed immortal emissaries from their respective sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, Mei Luoxiao, Yu Zhongxia, and the others were emissaries from the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Xi finally understood everything, and his brows couldn’t help but knit together tightly. He never expected that in just a single year of time, the situation in the Dark Reverie would actually become so grim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wasn’t wrong, the 50,000km of territory around Blaze City that was occupied by the nine great Xeno-race Saint Emperors was precisely the place he escaped the Ninth Hell from!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, his heart sank because long ago while he was still in the Ninth Hell, he was clearly aware that the reason those Xeno-race experts had broken through the dimension walls and attacked the Ninth hell was to make the Ninth Hell a foothold for them to prepare to siege the entire Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because even the Laws of the Heaven Dao didn’t exist in the Ninth Hell, so it was a superb place for the Xeno-race to hide themselves. Now, it would seem like the Xeno-race had obviously attained their objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, Sect Master, has the Heavenly Insight Palace really been completely annihilated?” Chen Xi thought of Su Qingyan, the peerlessly beautiful young woman from the Dartang Dynasty that had a good relationship with him. She’d joined the Heavenly Insight Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Huating sighed. “Its foundation is destroyed. Even though many people were fortunate enough to escape, it’s impossible to rebuild the former brilliance of the Heavenly Insight Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The forces of the Heavenly Insight Palace were on par with the Nine Radiance Sword Sect, yet such an colossus had actually been annihilated in a month, and it caused Wen Huating who was the Sect Master of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect to feel unprecedented pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When the heavens emit killing intent, the stars are moved; when the earth emits killing intent, dragons and serpents arise from the ground; and when humans emit killing intent, the world is overturned. These are only small scale events, and it’s only one of the three types of killing intents. The Dark Reverie won’t enter into great chaos for now, and it would truly be an omen of great chaos when even the Heaven Dao changes.” Suddenly, the tiny cauldron’s voice sounded out in Chen Xi’s ears.</span></p>
