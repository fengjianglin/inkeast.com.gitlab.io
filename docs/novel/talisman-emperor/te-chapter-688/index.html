On one hand, it was because of the instructions of the priest, and on the other hand, it was because she enjoyed talking with Chen Xi.</span></p>

So she’d unknowingly taken Chen Xi to be a good friend of hers.</span></p>

He dashed like a cheetah along a unique and profound rhythm, and he swiftly flashed past all the corpses on the ground.</span></p>

All of them died from having their souls shattered with a single strike. This indicated that the Divine Sense cultivation of the person that did this was extremely formidable, and it was numerous times more formidable than you and me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya was stunned, and then she said with astonishment, “Divine Sense attack? If it’s true, then wouldn’t it mean that a top expert appeared in the vicinity?”</span></p>

I rather believe it was done by those Xeno-race experts because it’s impossible that it was him!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya puckered her lips and went silent because she was able to understand Meng Wei’s feelings, and she couldn’t help but feel slightly guilty.</span></p>

The atmosphere was extremely bustling, and the faces of everyone was covered in a wisp of happiness that was impossible to conceal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their gains this time were enormous without a doubt. Those few tens of bone hawks and the Black Cerberus were sufficient for them to eat for an extremely long time, and this meant that they temporarily didn’t need to worry about starving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along the way here, they’d saved on everything they could, and they were even unwilling to throw away beast bones as they wished for nothing more than to boil them into a few pots of bone soup. Now, they suddenly obtained such a sumptuous meal, so they naturally had to eat freely and reward their stomachs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this bustling atmosphere, the beast skin tent that belonged to the Lord Priest had suddenly been opened from within, and a thin and bony old man walked out falteringly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

Every single gaze that looked towards the old man was filled with reverence and respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, they were slightly surprised. After all, all along the way during this journey, the Lord Priest had never taken a step out of his beast skin tent, yet he’d actually come out personally now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that something has happened?</span></p>

Because they saw the guest, Chen Xi, was following closely behind the Lord Priest, and they guessed that the appearance of the Lord Priest was probably related to this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man walked to the center of the campsite. Even though he was thin like a dried branch, yet he possessed a tall figure and heavy bearing, and he naturally carried a mighty aura of someone in a high position. His muddy gaze swept everyone in the surroundings before he said with a hoarse voice, “I came out this time only to announce a single thing. That is from tomorrow onward, Chen Xi will be in-charge of all the affairs of our tribe. Mo Ya and Meng Wei must obey Chen Xi’s orders as well. Has everyone heard me clearly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What? This outsider will take the position of the Chieftain of the tribe in the future?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is too absurd! He’s a sickly fellow that’s heavily injured and almost lost his life, an outsider that has just been taken in by our tribe, what ability does he possess to be our Chieftain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei’s face went grim as well, and he frowned without end. He similarly had never expected and couldn’t understand why the Lord Priest who he respected like a god in his heart would suddenly announce such a thing at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that the Lord Priest is displeased with me as the Chieftain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei’s brows knit together and formed the shape of the ‘</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">川</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">’ character. Even with his open-minded nature, he was temporarily unable to accept the scene before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t reluctant to give up the authority of the Chieftain, but he was extremely worried that if Chen Xi took the position of Chieftain, then would Chen Xi possess the ability to lead them safely to their destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What if a mishap were to occur, that would be an enormous calamity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, since they left their ancestral ground and set out on their journey, they’d lost too many clansmen all along the way, and it could be said that all of them were able to arrive here safely after paying the cost of the lives and blood of those clansmen of theirs that had sacrificed themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could this outsider, Chen Xi, carry such a heavy burden?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s snow white brows knit together, and then he said indifferently, “Mo Ya, are you questioning my authority?” His hoarse and low voice carried a trace of displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ya’s entire body stiffened before she gritted her teeth and knelt on the ground. “Lord Priest, Mo Ya isn’t questioning you. But our Ninth Hell Clan has experienced immense dangers and difficulties and sacrificed countless people to obtain our current peace. Now, an outsider is going to interfere in the affairs of our clan, I…it’s extremely difficult for me to accept this in my heart.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the people present, only Meng Wei and Xiao Yan didn’t kneel. Xiao Yan puckered her lips and was slightly at a loss for what to do, and she didn’t know if she should support her clansmen or support this new good friend she’d made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Mo Ya was staring fixedly at Chen Xi from the beginning until the end. Her gaze was ghastly as if she was scanning her prey and wanted to see through everything about Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in next to no time, she failed. Chen Xi’s gaze was warm, calm, and deep like the boundless starry sky, and it caused her to be unable to discern anything off about Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already made up my mind, all of you don’t have to continue trying to persuade me!” The old man’s attitude was extremely resolute, and he said with a hoarse voice, “I can only tell all of you that if you want to leave this place, the Ninth Hell, that’s said to have no way out, then only Chen Xi can accomplish it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What!?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked. Even though they knew the Lord Priest attached great importance onto this outsider, yet they never imagined that it would be to such an extent. He’d simply placed the hoped of their clan onto Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it’s really like that, then I agree!” Meng Wei spoke abruptly, and he didn’t look at Chen Xi but said with a deep voice, “But I have to make something clear. If he dares to do anything that’s harmful to my clan, then I, Meng Wei, will kill him even if I have to give up my life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, yet he was able to understand Meng Wei’s thoughts because he would surely do the same in Meng Wei’s place. After all, Meng Wei was sincerely thinking for the lives and safety of his clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely this caused Chen Xi to be unable to get angry at Meng Wei, and he just smiled bitterly as he looked at the old man by his side. Truthfully speaking, he wouldn’t interfere in this if he had a choice because not only wouldn’t he be taken to be a nice person, it would cause public indignation instead. Why go to such trouble?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s eyes narrowed before he smiled and shook his head at Chen Xi to indicate that Chen Xi shouldn’t take it to heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I agree as well!” Mo Ya noticed that the Lord Priest’s attitude was firm, and she knew she was unable to change it, so she gritted her teeth and said right away, “But just like Meng Wei, so long as this outsider shows the slightest sign of having ill intent towards my clan, then I’ll surely make him regret being born!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned once more, and then he sighed deeply in his heart but didn’t say anything. After all, his life was saved by these simple yet unyielding Ninth Hell clansmen, so how could he lose his temper against those that had saved his life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw Meng Wei and Mo Ya agree, the others glanced at each other before choosing to obey the Lord Priest’s order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, Chen Xi, I’ll entrust the rest to you. As for Mo Ya and Meng Wei, both of you come with me as I have something to tell the two of you.” As soon as the old man finished speaking, he turned around and walked towards his tent.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though these members of the Ninth Hell tribe openly displayed obedience earlier, the strong conflicting feelings in their hearts wasn’t something that could be eliminated in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So conversing with them at this moment would simply invite dislike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before he left, Chen Xi still gave a single instruction. At dawn tomorrow, he wanted those young children and youths to gather together, and he would replace Meng Wei in teaching and guiding them in their training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But these words of his drew the furious glares and cold grunts of the group of youths. Compared to those adults, these youths that were around the age of 11 or 12 weren’t skilled in concealing their feelings. Just like now, they stared at Chen Xi as if they were looking at a ferocious beast, and it was filled with dense hostility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Xiao Yan who was around the age of eight or nine stood up and cheered, and she became the only child amongst all that were present who welcomed Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in next to no time, she sensed the strangeness of the surrounding atmosphere and the numerous furious glares that shot towards her, and this caused her to feel uncomfortable before sitting down embarrassedly in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She puckered her tiny lips, and then she muttered with annoyance and shame. “Once all of you know how interesting the stories Big Brother tells are, all of you will surely not treat him like this!”</span></p>
