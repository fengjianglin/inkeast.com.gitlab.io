But, he’d found his match now!</span></p>

Those two figures were like two wyrms that were coiled together as they surged about violently and fought valiantly, and they fought from the heavens to the earth before entering into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle seemed to already be capable of being called a peak battle in the Nether Transformation Realm, and it alarmed everyone within the Dark Parasol Secret Realm!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never imagined that there’re actually young men of such level amongst the natives of the three dimensions.” The man raised his eyes and focused towards the distance while a wisp of a bloodthirsty and excited sheen suffused his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His figure was extremely tall while his hair hung loosely behind his head. He wore a golden robe that was embroidered with numerous strange patterns that seemed like devils yet weren’t devils, seemed like demons yet weren’t demons, and it formed a terrifying, ghastly, and mysterious pattern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was precisely that mysterious figure called Xuan Chen.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already utilized the Darklight Ice Sacrifice Technique to deduce that the Creation Sword Domain will emerge in less than three days, whereas, the Creation Sword Domain is one of the barriers that guard the Door of Profundity. If we want to enter it, then we must arrive at the Creation Sword Domain extremely early, otherwise, if those natives of the three dimensions beat us to it and seize that divine object, then we’ll be unable to report the fulfillment of our assignment to the Lord.” Xue Kui frowned as she spoke. She was peerlessly beautiful and similarly wore a golden robe. Her slender and plump thighs were much longer than an ordinary woman, and it caused her to seem more slender, graceful, and beautiful. “So, I advise you not to do that so as to avoid exposing our identities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Disappointing! Truly disappointing!” Xuan Chen sighed deeply and was extremely disgruntled, but the ruthless and ghastly expression in his eyes grew even deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, the dressing of those two fellows is so strange.” Right at this moment, a group of cultivators flashed over from the distance, and all of them were stunned upon seeing Xuan Chen and Xuan Kui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A group of little natives dares to point at me and talk about me? Die!” Xuan Chen’s eyes surged with a bloody glow as he stretched out with his hand and grabbed, causing a wisp of a dazzling beam of light to stretch out and envelop down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

Those cultivators hadn’t even reacted to what had happened when they were directly blasted into balls of dense bloody mist, and they didn’t even have the time to let out shrill cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mmm, Nether Transformation Realm Bloodsoul Pills. Unfortunately, the taste is slightly inferior, but it’s better than nothing.” Xuan Chen chewed as he let out a sigh of comfort. He had ghastly blood red eyes and sharp teeth, and there were strands of blood flowing down from the corners of his mouth, causing him to seem extraordinarily terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” Xuan Kui frowned and glanced at this bloodthirsty and perverted madman before turning around and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mmm, I forgot to leave some for you to enjoy. Once the Door of Profundity emerges, I’ll refine all the cultivators here into Bloodsoul Pills for you to enjoy. How about it?” Xuan Chen shook his head and chuckled as he followed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

But the more it’s like this, the more excited it makes me because killing a genius provides a better sense of accomplishment than killing a pile of trash! Chen Xi, am I right?” In the sky, Yan Shisan roared into the sky as the glow of flames curled up from his entire body. He took a step forward in midair like a god of flames. He seemed extremely violent and the stars, moon, and sun circulated in his hand as he charged at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly how terrifying and overbearing is this ability of grasping the world in his hand and forming the sun, stars, and moon!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those numerous stars, sun, and moon surged with the glow of flames as they appeared in the sky, causing the heavens and the earth to be cast into a shade. It seemed like a starry sky that was a sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

This palm strike of Yan Shisan’s contained the heavens and the earth and formed stars. It was too terrifying and was like a tempestuous storm that swept through 5,000km in the surroundings with a might capable of obliterating everything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That might not necessarily be the case. The person that dies today might be you, Yan Shisan!” Chen Xi spoke with an extremely calm voice, and the Wings of Disruption flapped as he charged forward to meet Yan Shisan’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His attack didn’t have any dazzling lights or stars that lay across the sky, but it possessed a terrifying imposing aura that shook those stars, sun, and moon to the point of shattering one by one, and it was a terrifying scene that seemed like the obliteration of the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, this was the Obliteration Dao Insight. But it was executed by Chen Xi with a Dao Art, causing its might to be even more terrifying, and it caused all the stars, moon, and sun Yan Shisan formed to be blasted apart and obliterated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi swung his fist out ceaselessly as he moved straight ahead and went head-on against Yan Shisan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was lacking in two times combat strength when compared to Yan Shisan, his Blackhole World was even more solid and vast, and coupled with the assistance of the Dark Parasol sapling, the vital energy and True Essence in his entire body was practically at a peak state at all times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he was utterly unafraid when going head-on against Yan Shisan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a terrifying scene shocked everyone in the surroundings to the point of retreating repeatedly, as they were deeply afraid of being affected because their lives would be in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Zhenbei and An Wei were dazed by this scene, and their minds shook without end. Never had they imagined that Chen Xi’s combat strength had actually attained such a level. Earlier, he’d swept through all enemies as he fought the crowd of geniuses, and now he fought Yan Shisan equally. Such strength was something that even they considered themselves to be inferior to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Swiftly deal with this person. I sensed the aura of Xeno-race experts from outside the three dimensions just a moment ago. Perhaps they’ve come for the sake of the Chaotic Divine Crystal as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when Chen Xi was battling Yan Shisan fiercely, the voice of the tiny cauldron suddenly resounded out in his heart, and it instantly caused him to be shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xeno-race experts?</span></p>

Even a Heavenly Immortal like Bing Shitian wasn’t a match for them, and if it wasn’t for the tiny cauldron making a move at the critical moment, the entire Primeval Battlefield might have fallen into the hands of those Xeno-race experts!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now there were actually Xeno-race experts that had snuck into the Dark Reverie and arrived within the Dark Parasol Secret Realm, so how could this not shock Chen Xi?</span></p>

There was only less than a thousand years remaining from the upheaval of the three dimensions. So the appearance of these Xeno-race experts at this moment was undoubtedly a type of sign, and it caused him to sense a slight feeling of impending disaster.</span></p>
