 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person in the lead of these people was an emaciated old man with greying hair, and he emanated a gloomy and ghastly aura. His entire body emanated Immortal Energy that fluttered down like a rain of light, and it seemed as if it had been soaked in a pool of blood, causing it to be suffused with specks of scarlet red light and seem extremely horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a formidable Peak Sovereign at the eighth level of the Earthly Immortal Realm!</span></p>

Perhaps very few people from the Netherworld had heard his name, yet once the name Iron Butcher was mentioned, then he was someone that was known to all, and his name caused the faces of all to go pale and capable of stopping the tears of children at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four people by his side similarly possessed formidable strengths at the eighth level of the Earthly Immortal Realm, and they were usually holding down the fort in the Punishment Bureau. They possessed lofty status, and they were existences of senior rank.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So in the next moment, the gazes they shot at Chen Xi had become icy cold and gloomy, and they seemed as if they were staring at a tiny ant that dared to provoke an eagle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cui Lengzhong, even you’ve betrayed my father?” Suddenly, Cui Qingning spoke while her eyes swept towards Cui Lengzhong and the others, and her young face was filled with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve always been serving the Punishment Bureau and served the Cui Clan, so how could we have betrayed the clan? Young Miss, don’t make slanderous charges against us.” Cui Lengzhong spoke with an indifferent expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other sneered endlessly as well, and they remained completely indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingning, these are the past subordinates of your father’s?” Chen Xi asked directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. That’s Cui Lengzhong, a branch disciple of the Cui Clan that was impoverished. All those years ago, if it wasn’t for my father feeling pity towards the difficulty he faced in surviving and taught him how to cultivate, how could he possibly possess his current status?” Cui Qingning spoke coldly. “As for those other four, they’re roughly similar to Cui Lengzhong. But I never imagined that they would actually betray my father and side with Cui Fangjun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Miss, you’re being too mischievous. You actually colluded with outsides and took us to be traitors. Merely this has already violated the rules of the clan. Quickly admit your guilt right now and perhaps you might be able to live.” A peak sovereign spoke with a low voice and an indifferent bearing, and he revealed a sense of looking down upon all beings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Colluding with outsiders?” Cui Qingning chuckled lightly while her eyes were completely devoid of emotion. “As traitors, do all of you have the qualifications to speak these words?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took a deep breath and spoke word by word. “Actually, I knew since a long time ago that the reason the internal strife of the Cui Clan wasn’t able to be dealt with was because you traitors helped Cui Fangjun in his crimes. Perhaps that first thing I should do upon taking control of the Cui Clan is to annihilate all the traitors in the clan. Only in this way would I be able to attain generations of peace for my Cui Clan in exchange!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Internal peace was the first step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like this since the ancient times until now. If the poison within a clan wasn’t eliminated, then a calamity would still occur sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So her words weren’t wrong at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when these words entered into the ears of Cui Lengzhong, it caused his eyelids to twitch before he said coldly and indifferently, “You really are immature!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw this, Chen Xi knew that it was useless no matter what Cui Qingning said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Allow me.” Chen Xi patted the young woman on the shoulder before he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

He seemed like an emperor of talismans that had awakened, and his imposing aura shot into the sky and terrified the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pupils of Cui Lengzhong and the others constricted while a wisp of shock appeared on their faces. They seemed to have never imagined that an extremely young little fellow would actually possess a strength at the eighth level of the Earthly Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Miss, no wonder you’re fearless. So it turns out that you’ve found the assistance of an expert. Unfortunately, this little bit of strength isn’t enough at all.” Cui Lengzhong shook his head without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Guardian Cui, don’t waste your breath with them. Allow me to kill this kid first!” A peak sovereign wasn’t able to restrain himself, and he took a step forward in space before blasting out with his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This punch seemed as if it had opened the doors to hell, and numerous savage yaksha and ferocious evil spirits surged out from within the force of this punch, and they were like a tide that smashed down onto Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t move at all when facing this. His eyes suddenly became deep, and it seemed as if the secrets of the universe were circulating within his eyes as they emanated strands of profound and icy cold jet black light that caused time and space to warp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eye of Divine Truth — The Light of Eradication!</span></p>

As Chen Xi’s gaze swept over, these yaksha and evil spirits that were formed from the force of his punch seemed as if their bodies were lit up, and they exploded into pieces like paper. They couldn’t even withstand a single strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? Bastard! I underestimated you! Take another punch of mine!” The peak sovereign was stunned before his face sank, and he suddenly blasted another punch at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu~ Wu~ Wu~</span></p>

Peerless killing intent converged on it, causing it to seem as if purgatory had descended into the world, and it transformed the expanse of space into a ghastly region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancient Slaughter Purgatory Fist!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vertical eye between his brows opened, and everyone instantly felt that the heavens and the earth seemed to have fallen into darkness. Time and space warped while a terrifying force field appeared in midair.</span></p>
