At the instant it was activated, a gentle and clear voice curled up from it, causing Chen Xi to have a long lost feeling of familiarity, and it was precisely Bai Wanqing’s voice.</span></p>

I’ll surely return to meet you after at least three years or five years at most. During this period of time, you should just cultivate at ease. I’m very much at ease with Senior Liu Jianheng taking care of you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remember, the Dark Reverie isn’t like the Darchu Dynasty. Sects are numerous like trees in a forest, and it’s boundlessly vast. Since you’ve come alone to the Dark Reverie, you must be careful, and don’t rashly take risks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I know that you’re concerned about the whereabouts of your parents. But all I can tell you now is that your father, Chen Lingjun, is still alive and well, whereas your mother, Zuoqiu Xue, is the same…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The voice revealed a slightly pressed tone, and it seemed to have been left behind hastily. The voice vanished without a trace in a mere few breaths of time, and the jade slip instantly shattered into powder as well.</span></p>

Since he was young, his grandfather had never mentioned his father’s name, and every time he asked his grandfather, his grandfather’s expression would sink instantly before flaring up and fiercely lecturing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, his father’s name was like a taboo in his life.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lingjun… Chen Lingjun…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi muttered and seemed to want to see through every little thing related to his father in his memory from this name. But he noticed in the end that he actually had no impression of his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His father’s appearance, his father’s nature… He didn’t know anything!</span></p>

Why did you abandon me and Chen Hao? Why were you even able to disregard grandfather’s fate? Why…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had too many ‘whys’ in his heart. But he knew that only when he saw his father with his own two eyes would he be able to find out the answer to all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, he’d calmed down the feelings in his heart that were rising and falling intensely, and then he turned around and returned to his wooden house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade slip Bai Wanqing left behind had only made one thing clear. She had no choice but to leave the Bai Clan now for some reason that couldn’t be opposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wanted to meet her, then he had to wait for three to five years from now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Chen Xi already felt extremely satisfied now. Because he knew that his parents were still alive, and it allowed him to firm his confidence once more. So long as he worked hard and continued on this path, he would one day be able to meet them again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that because he’d entered into a state of Dao comprehension while in battle earlier, his body had absorbed tremendous amounts of spirit energy while his spirit, essence, and energy had attained an unprecedentedly blazing height, causing the scene before his eyes to occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he could feel delighted, he suddenly noticed that after he gained control of the vital energy in his entire body, the feeling of being on the verge of breakthrough had suddenly vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that the time to advance hasn’t arrived…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned, and he felt that taking this step into the Nether Transformation Realm was truly too difficult. Even though no tribulation would descend, it was the barrier that was most difficult for him to surmount since he started cultivating until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nether Transformation Realm broke the shackles of the body and opened up a Blackhole in the body, and it was a realm that transformed the Rebirth Wheel into a world. At that time, the essence of a cultivator’s vitality, the energy in a cultivator’s body, the mind, the soul… Everything would undergo a qualitative transformation. Every single move a Nether Transformation Realm cultivator made was capable of conforming and fusing with the world before erupting with boundless potential and combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, this was a barrier that was extremely difficult to surmount. Most of the cultivators in the world were stopped before this barrier, and they perished with hatred in their hearts from their lifespan drying up in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was in the Dark Reverie, an existence at the Nether Transformation Realm could be addressed as a great figure. Moreover, cultivators that had attained this realm would usually be addressed respectfully as great cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The word ‘great’ vividly portrayed the height and might represented by the Nether Transformation Realm.</span></p>

I’ll leave everything to fate.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, Chen Xi recovered his calm and started cultivating in meditation.</span></p>

Especially his grasp and utilization of Dao Arts, and it allowed him to understand the formidableness of Dao Arts even more deeply.</span></p>

The more one cultivated it, the more one was able to appreciate the might and profundities within it.</span></p>

So long as he tempered and comprehended slowly, he would be able to reach perfection eventually.</span></p>

If it was someone that wasn’t from the sect, then even a Heavenly Immortal would find it difficult to take a single step within the sect, and once someone not from the sect was discovered by the restrictions, the person would be directly eliminated by the restrictions.</span></p>

For example, it was simply impossible for outsiders to sneak into extraordinary powers like this, and it would be useless even if a group of Heavenly Immortals attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were over 100 disciples gathered at this moment within the Performance Hall that possessed a grand imposing aura. Moreover, there were disciples that rushed over from time to time, causing it to seem rather popular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi stepped foot into the hall, he saw that the entire hall was extremely vast, and a mere 100 plus disciples standing within it weren’t conspicuous in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He swept the surroundings with his gaze before directly heading towards the depths of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a disciple of the Performance Hall present there, and they were in charge of the acceptance of all assignments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before an enormous table were a few white clothed disciples sitting upright there, and they were organizing the piles of assignment command tokens on the table. One of these disciples heard the sound of footsteps, and he asked without raising his head. “What sort of assignment do you want to take?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Test assignments,” replied Chen Xi. He already knew now that the assignments in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect were divided into two types. One was the test assignments that disciples had to complete within a set period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other type was reward assignments. Anyone could accept them and so long as one completed them, one would be able to obtain the corresponding reward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under normal circumstances, test assignments were directly distributed by the Performance Hall to the disciples of the various peaks, and it was very rarely that a disciple would come to the Performance Hall and actively take a test assignment&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the difficulty of test assignments weren’t high, and besides the basic benefits and resources of the sect, there weren’t any other rewards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, reward assignments were different. They were divided in detail into nine grades according to their varying difficulties. Grade one was the lowest and grade nine was the highest. In this way, the rewards were naturally more or less divided into nine grades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even the reward from the lowest grade one reward assignment was more than 10 times better than the rewards of test assignments. So most people that came to take assignments in the Performance Hall came for the reward tests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though a person like Chen Xi who took test assignments couldn’t be said to be one in a million, it could still be considered as rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Test assignments?” Sure enough, the disciple behind the table couldn’t help but be stunned when he heard this. But when he raised his eyes and saw the person before him was Chen Xi, he instantly came to an understand and said with a smile, “So it’s the West Radiance Peak’s Junior Brother Chen Xi. Right, has the assignment Junior Brother Qing Yu took the other day been completed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s completed.” As he spoke, Chen Xi raised his hand and flipped it, causing a Mirage Jade Slip to appear before he passed it over. Within the Mirage Jade Slip was the scenes of him killing the seven dark pheasant demons, and it was utterly impossible to be falsified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm, right, the seven dark pheasant demons have been annihilated.” The disciple looked through the jade slip and confirmed it was correct before he said with a smile, “Then which test assignment do you want to take this time, Junior Brother Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he’d casually moved his finger, causing almost 100 test command tokens to instantly appear on the table. All of these were the test assignments owed by the West Radiance Peak in these past few years, and all of it were piled into a small hill here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give all of these to me.” Chen Xi sized up the pile of test command tokens before speaking calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? All!?” All the disciples behind the table raised their heads and seemed to not dare believe their ears. Even though the difficulty of test assignments weren’t high, it was sufficient to be a headache if one took almost 100 in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, not only did these test assignments encompass the annihilation of evil cultivators, there were also assignments to find treasures, escort goods, gather materials, and so on and so forth. They encompassed all sorts of strange things, and it was practically impossible to be completed by a single person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention that these disciples of the Performance Hall knew that the time limit for all the test assignments owed by the West Radiance Peak was a single month. Was it possible for Chen Xi to complete almost 100 assignments by himself in such a short period of time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother Chen Xi, you need to know that once you take all these assignments, you’ll suffer the punishment of the sect if you’re unable to complete them within the set period of time, and it might even lead to imprisonment.” Someone couldn’t help but speak out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give them to me.” Chen Xi smiled, and with a flick of his sleeve, he’d already taken all the assignment command tokens on the table before turning and leaving the Performance Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that this fellow doesn’t know that the Peak Trials are about to begin in less than two months of time? He isn’t cultivating concentratedly, but wants to complete test assignments? Isn’t he slightly abandoning his future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what do you want him to do? Elder Mo Yu has already given a final order that the disciples of the West Radiance Peak would be punished if they were incapable of completing all the test assignments they owed. It’s common knowledge that besides Chen Xi that has just entered the sect, the other disciples from West Radiance Peak aren’t worth mentioning. Under these circumstances, only Chen Xi can accomplish these things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that you say this, it’s truly difficult for Chen Xi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, let’s not discuss this first. I’m instead worried that Chen Xi’s hope to complete all these test assignments within a month is extremely tiny…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, it is. If he’s unable to complete them, he’ll probably even be unable to participate in the upcoming Peak Trials. After all, if he’s punished, then he’ll probably be stripped of his qualifications to participate in the Peak Trials.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at Chen Xi leaving, those disciples of the Performance Hall couldn’t help but discuss animatedly, and all their discussions were filled with feelings of not looking favorably upon these actions of Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi has really come. I only have to report this matter to Master.” At a corner of the Performance Hall, Xin Ruhai had witnessed everything that had happened earlier, and he couldn’t help but shake his head and sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But after he pondered for a moment, he still turned around and headed towards the depths of the hall. That place he headed to was precisely the cultivation location of Elder Mo Yu who managed the Performance Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
