 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, Chen Xi had already arrived at the other side of the street before stretching out his arms to tightly embrace little Chen Yu on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We haven’t seen each other for a year. Little Chen Yu, you’ve grown tall. Mmm, you’re even more handsome than when your father was young.” Chen Xi rubbed the little fellow’s head intimately as he praised by a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Chen Yu blinked his pitch black and large eyes as he sat on Chen Xi’s shoulder and chuckled without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why have all of you come? Where’s Chen Hao?” Chen Xi teased little Chen Yu as he asked Fei Lengcui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father said that there are innumerable and arduous tasks to be done in the clan, and it’s essential that he assumes command. So he let my Mother bring me along to Silken City and cheer for Uncle.” Little Chen Yu answered before Fei Lengcui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi immediately understood everything.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Chen Clan is probably in a stage of swift expansion now, so it naturally can’t go without Chen Hao managing the overall situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, long time no see. I never imagined that you’d be able to obtain such accomplishments. There’s probably no one in the southern territory’s cultivation world that hasn’t heard of your name now.” Amidst a warm and hearty laughter, Daoist Wen Xuan walked over, and behind him was a pair of young man and woman that were heroic and exuberant. Shockingly, it was the siblings, Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw Chen Xi, the two siblings were extremely happy as well, and their faces were covered in smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greeting, Senior Wen Xuan.” Chen Xi hurriedly passed little Chen Yu to Fei Lengcui before moving forward to greet Daoist Wen Xuan. Daoist Wen Xuan was the master of his younger brother, Chen Hao, that had taken great care of Chen Hao while he was in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, so Chen Xi didn’t dare be disrespectful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Xuan waved his hand and said with displeased, “It’s been so many years, yet you still address me like that, kid. If my Master finds out about this, he’d surely scold me thoroughly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, Okay, Okay, Big Brother Wen Xuan. Addressing you like this is fine, right?” said Chen Xi with a smile. Wen Xuan’s master was the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s Supreme Elder, Bei Heng, the sworn brother of Chen Xi. If they were to form a relationship according to seniority, then Wen Xuan would probably have to address him as Martial Uncle, so it was better to form a relationship where both are of equal seniority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he smiled to Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei, and it could be considered as greeting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subsequently, Chen Xi chatted with Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin for a short moment before bringing all of them along towards his residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streets were surging with people and extremely clamorous, so it wasn’t the best place to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi found out along the way that the reason Fei Lengcui and little Chen Yu were able to arrive safely at Silken City was all thanks to Wen Xuan taking care of them. With the presence of Wen Xuan, who was a Nether Transformation Stage expert, then unless they encountered an Earthly Immortal Realm expert, they would absolutely not face any danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Qingxi’s group of three benefited from their association with Chen Xi as well, and they followed Wen Xuan’s group to arrive at Silken City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the southern territory was too far away from Silken City, and their strengths weren’t high. Without this great expert, Wen Xuan, leading the group, they really might not be able to arrive safely at Silken City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What caused Chen Xi to be rather embarrassed was that when Du Qingxi and Mu Yao saw Ya Qing, Yun Na, and Yan Yan, the atmosphere instantly became strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These five women more or less had some involvement with him. At this moment, when they were gathered together, even though they chatted extremely warmly on the surface, the situation revealed slight strangeness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the five women wouldn’t go to the extent of becoming locked in argument because of this. The conversation between them was mostly in the form of probing, and the situation of being in confrontation didn’t occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They seemed to want to confirm Chen Xi’s relationship with the other women and the emotional entanglement of Chen Xi with the other women through a period of probing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for what actions they would take after getting a grasp of the situation, that was something only they themselves knew. The heart of a woman was like a needle at the bottom of the ocean, it couldn’t be ascertained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wen Xuan and Fei Lengcui acutely noticed the difference in atmosphere, and they were both amused and slightly surprised in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Yan was fine, she couldn’t be said to have any intimate relationship with Chen Xi and could at most be said to have a relationship as a friend with Chen Xi. But she was at the center of it, and when seen in the eyes of others, even if there was no relationship between her and Chen Xi, there was one in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused her to be both irritated and amused, and she swallowed a bitter pill in silence, as even if she explained, she wouldn’t be able to explain it clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to this, Wang Zhenfeng, Song Ling, Duanmu Ze, and Mu Wenfei quickly blended together. All of them walked with their arms over each other’s shoulders as they chatted and bragged, and they chatted with great pleasure as if they regretted they’d not met sooner and as if they’d known each other for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was extremely understandable. Even though Wang Zhenfeng was respected as the Junior Marquis of the Thunder Marquis Estate, yet he was on friendly terms with Chen Xi now, so he naturally wouldn’t put on airs before Chen Xi’s friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually, Chen Xi wanted to chat with Wang Zhenfeng and the others, or at the very least, chatting with Daoist Wen Xuan was fine as well. At least he would be able to temporarily avoid the attention of these women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter if it was Wang Zhenfeng and others, or Daoist Wen Xuan, they’d understood the situation clearly long ago. They knew that if they were take Chen Xi in, then it would be an act of bringing calamity onto themselves, so who wouldn’t ignore Chen Xi?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was already sufficiently benevolent of them for not taking pleasure in Chen Xi’s misfortune and adding fuel to the fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi could only target little Chen Yu when he saw this. But the little fellow was playing happily with the fluffy Bai Kui at this moment, so he ignored his Uncle as well, causing Chen Xi to be extremely helpless and at a loss for what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling of being at a loss for what to do continued all the way until he returned to his residence, and then Chen Xi finally heaved a sigh of relief before hurriedly using the cover of holding a feast to welcome the arrival of everyone and flee into the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, he even locked the door behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this bit of obstacle posed no difficulty to the five young women and breaking through and entering was easy to the extreme. But due to their identities and the reserved manner they held in their hearts, they sulkily let Chen Xi off for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What caused Chen Xi to be extremely troubled was that right when he finished preparing the feast and everyone had gathered together with the intention of eating, Zhen Liuqing had actually come over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they looked at this beautiful young woman from the Mistwater Pavilion that was praised greatly by the current Emperor Chu, Wang Zhenfeng and the other men were filled with admiration and envy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, those women’s minds were muddled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did we suddenly…have another rival?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Chen Xi couldn’t help but sigh deeply, and he felt that at this moment, his mind and body felt even more exhausted than when killing a ferocious beast with extraordinary strength.</span></p>

She didn’t say anything further and shook her skirt as she grinned and sat by Chen Xi’s side, and then she exclaimed with admiration as she looked at the delicacies that filled the table. “What a sumptuous dinner. I haven’t eaten yet, so can you prepare a set of bowl and chopsticks for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You’ve already sat down, so do you even have to ask?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed once more in his heart. These women weren’t ordinary women, and on the contrary, every single one of them was more intelligent and wise than the other. If he wanted to get rid of them, it would simply be a tremendous amount of work that was complicated to the point it caused one’s head to ache, and it caused one to be terrified from just the sight of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aunty, here’s your bowl and chopsticks.” Little Chen Yu walked to Zhen Liuqing’s side and passed over a bowl and chopsticks, and he put on an extremely obedient and intelligent display. But the words he said next caused Chen Xi to instantly wish for nothing more than to slap his tiny ass. The little fellow blinked his pitch black eyes naively as he said with a clear voice, “Aunty, are you an intimate friend of my Uncle’s as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mouthful of wine sprayed out from Wang Zhenfeng’s mouth, and he coughed without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Wen Xuan, Fei Lengcui, and the others became extremely peculiar as well. Never had they imagined that this little fellow would actually expose this layer of secret. So how could Chen Xi continue covering it up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhen Liuqing was stunned as well, and then her clear eyes spun to glance at Chen Xi before smiling to little Chen Yu. “Wouldn’t you know if you ask your Uncle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Chen Xi possibly sit there helplessly and await his doom, so he picked up his chopsticks and said with a low voice, “Everyone has traveled for an entire day and are probably completely exhausted. Let’s finish our meal and go rest earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he glanced at Daoist Wen Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Wen Xuan coughed dryly and smiled as he said with a clear voice. “Right, let’s eat first. This table full of delicacies were personally cooked by Chen Xi, and it wouldn’t be nice to eat once it gets cold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the people present, his seniority was the highest, so him speaking out to help Chen Xi at this moment didn’t cause anyone to be displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never knew that you possessed such good culinary skills. Since you personally cooked it, then I have to taste it properly.” Zhen Liuqing glanced deeply at Chen Xi and grinned as she finished speaking before picking up her chopsticks and eating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the others saw this, they moved their chopsticks in succession to eat and drink, and the atmosphere quickly became bustling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi instantly heaved a sigh of relief, and then he hastily had his meal before standing up as he said, “The Allstar Meeting is about to begin. I want to seize this period of time to cultivate properly for a while…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go on. I’m most familiar with Silken City, so I’ll help you entertain everyone. You can feel at ease while you cultivate during this period of time. Leave the rest to me.” Before Chen Xi could finish speaking, Ya Qing had already spoken out with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed. The Allstar Meeting is about to begin, and the experts participating in it are numerous like the clouds. Seizing this period of time to prepare properly is greatly beneficial to your participation in the Allstar Meeting,” said Wen Xuan with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the support of these two people, the others naturally didn’t have the slightest objection. The Allstar Meeting wasn’t a game, and it converged numerous heroic talents from the entire Darchu Dynasty, so the more sufficiently Chen Xi prepared, the higher his chances of advancing would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst the people present, only Chen Xi, Wang Zhenfeng, and Zhen Liuqing were participating in the Allstar Meeting, whereas the others had come to watch the competition, so they didn’t dare disturb these three people at a time like this so as to avoid affecting their display of strength during the Allstar Meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good luck, Uncle! You must take first place!” Little Chen Yu spoke with a clear voice.</span></p>
