 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The numerous cultivators present were slightly surprised, bewildered, and in disbelief.</span></p>

Yet now, merely one of them was recruited as a disciple of the Heavenflow Dao Sect, whereas no one showed any interest in the others!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this be possible?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Chen Xi’s name was still strikingly displayed at the position of the first on the Warsoul Tablet behind them, and it wasn’t just that, because in terms of reputation there wasn’t a single person in Primeval City capable of comparing with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d gone against the entire Shang Clan by himself, annihilated a strand of a Heavenly Immortal’s will by himself, and he’d even annihilated four Xeno-race experts during the final test!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, such a peerless genius that possessed the potential to mature into an exalted figure had actually not been selected. How could anyone have expected such an outcome?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they disregarded Chen Xi, every single one of the disciples of the Darchu Dynasty was extremely outstanding, and practically all their rankings were in the top 20 of the Warsoul Tablet. But they were similarly not chosen by any of the sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Isn’t… Isn’t this too weird?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even though they felt extreme pity towards the situation Chen Xi and the others were in, yet none of them dared say a thing. Because their fate was similarly held in the hands of those emissaries of the Dark Reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 10 plus emissaries stood in midair with an impressive and dignified manner like gods, and it was utterly impossible to discern merely from their expressions that this was an action that was planned beforehand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But attentive people were still able to notice that the gazes of these emissaries intentionally or unintentionally avoided the location of the disciples of the Darchu Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, a wisp of a smile was revealed from the corners of Feng Jianbai and Shang Que’s mouths, and the gazes they shot at Chen Xi and the others were filled with ridicule, pity, resentment, and so on and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them had enmity with Chen Xi and were only too anxious to see this scene occur. At this moment, when he saw Chen Xi and the others reveal expressions of discontent and disappointment, both of them truly wished for nothing more than to roar with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, the name list has already been announced. Those disciples that haven’t been selected don’t have to be discouraged. The Dark Reverie is a vast and large world, there are countless sects and experts that’re numerous like trees in a forest within it. After all of you enter the Dark Reverie, perhaps you’ll encounter your own fortune.” Ancestor Zi Ming spoke with a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, it was equivalent to the results being certain, and it was impossible for Chen Xi and the others to refute the decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the scene was extremely strange. Amongst the 113 experts of the various Dynasties, 99% had been selected by the various powers of the Dark Reverie, and these disciples were standing behind the various emissaries at this moment. Only Chen Xi and the others stood alone at the opposite of them, and they’d become the small group of people that hadn’t been selected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a type of strong comparison that caused Chen Xi and the others to seem like abandoned sheep, and they seemed slightly pitiable, causing most people to reveal expressions of pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A group of proud geniuses had fallen to such an extent now, so how could it not cause them to sigh with emotion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no time to lose, let’s make a move together and open the passageway that leads to the Dark Reverie.” Yun Lansheng sighed before he spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Earthly Immortal Realm experts from the Dark Reverie nodded successively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a moment!” However, right at this moment, a chilly voice that sounded like a flowing fountain resounded out as Qing Xiuyi took a step forward, and her cold gaze swept the emissaries of the Dark Reverie before it finally descended onto Yun Lansheng. “When did I agree to join your Heavenflow Dao Sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, they weren’t inferior to a thunderclap that shook the disciples of the various Dynasties to the point of revealing astounded expressions, and even the other emissaries of the Dark Reverie revealed shocked expressions as they seemed to have never imagined that there would actually be someone that wanted to give up such a great piece of good luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Chen Xi and the others were slightly stunned, a wisp of warmth gushed out from within their hearts, because they knew that reason Qing Xiuyi had acted in this way was entirely because she’d made the resolution to stay by their sides through thick and thin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This piece of friendship was priceless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was especially so for Chen Xi, because he understood the most about importance of the Heavenflow Dao Sect to Qing Xiuyi. However, at this moment, she’d resolutely given up on returning to the sect of her previous life, and besides causing him to be moved, this decision made his heart ache faintly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for me, would Xiuyi have to act in this way?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t because of me, how could all my companions have fallen to this extent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A feeling of deep self-accusation silently gushed into his heart. No one had noticed that Chen Xi’s fists were already clenched tightly, the veins on the back of his hand bulged while his nails sunk deeply into his palm, causing strands of scarlet red blood to flow out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qing Xiuyi, your path is in the Heavenflow Dao Sect. Giving it up like this is equivalent to destroying your own future. You should follow me back to the sect. There’re some things that can’t be solved by being willful.” Yun Lansheng frowned as he sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he not understand Qing Xiuyi’s feelings? However, he had to take Qing Xiuyi back to the Heavenflow Dao Sect no matter what. This was decided by Bing Shitian’s will, and not a single person present as capable of changing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Lansheng, you were still an outer court disciple while I was cultivating at the Heavenflow Dao Sect, right? Since when did you dare to speak to me like this?” Qing Xiuyi spoke coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scalps of everyone went numb when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My god! This woman is actually the Senior Sister of an emissary!? This identity is too shocking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only those emissaries of the Dark Reverie had known all of this since long ago, and all of them seemed to be rather composed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Lansheng himself had never imagined that Qing Xiuyi would actually use her identity to suppress him at this moment, and he couldn’t help but sigh and laugh bitterly. “Senior Sister Qing, I’m doing this for you own good. The Sect Master and all the elders of the sect are anxiously awaiting your return, so I hope you don’t make it difficult for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present felt as if they’d gone crazy when they heard Yun Lansheng admit the relationship between him and Qing Xiuyi, and it was as if they’d heard a strange and unusual legend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since when could the disciple of an ordinary Dynasty actually be able to become the Senior Sister of an Earthly Immortal Realm expert from an extraordinary power of the Dark Reverie?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they came to an understanding in next to no time. Qing Xiuyi was a reincarnated Heavenly Immortal, and she probably cultivated in the Heavenflow Dao Sect during her previous life.</span></p>

Their Young Master Shang Kun intended to use Qing Xiuyi as a cultivation vessel to cultivate a Devil Technique that day, and if they knew beforehand that Qing Xiuyi’s origins were so great, they wouldn’t dare do it, no matter how brave they were.</span></p>

During his youth, Qing Xiuyi was similarly an existence that couldn’t be disrespected in his heart, and even if it was today, this reverence still existed eternally in his heart. How could he have imagined that the day would come where he used force against the Senior Sister he respected the most?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was precisely Bing Shitian. His clothes and jet black dense hair fluttered in the wind, and Immortal Energy even flowed around his body, causing him to reveal the unique imposing aura of a Heavenly Immortal. At the instant he appeared, he’d become the one and only center of attention.</span></p>

This sort of flinty attitude caused everyone present to be endlessly astounded in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian was stunned, and then he smiled. “Senior Sister, your temper is still like before and hasn’t changed in the slightest. This can’t be any better, because this is your true self. Once you return to the Heavenflow Dao Sect, the Sect Master and the various elders will surely be extremely delighted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t you hear her? Xiuyi has already decided to not return with all of you!” Chen Xi suddenly spoke out, causing everyone present to be shocked in their hearts, as they never expected he would actually dare speak at this moment, nor did they imagine that he would be so discourteous when speaking to a Heavenly Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most shocking of it all was Chen Xi addressed Qing Xiuyi as ‘Xiuyi,’ yet Qing Xiuyi actually didn’t reveal any objections!</span></p>

The answer was already self-evident. It was surely the word — Love!</span></p>

Never had they imagined that Chen Xi would actually fight for a woman with a Heavenly Immortal. Moreover, he seemed to have gained the upper hand…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, your memories from your previous life haven’t recovered. Forgive your Junior Brother for this offence, but I’ll have to wrong you for now.” After being silent for a long time, he suddenly spoke out with a gentle voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This process occurred too swiftly, swiftly to the point everyone present only felt something flash before their eyes, and when they looked over once more, Qing Xiuyi had already fallen asleep and was passed over to Yun Lansheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such ability looked to be extremely simple, yet it fully displayed the might of a Heavenly Immortal, and besides causing everyone present to be shocked, they felt even more reverent towards Bing Shitian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the expressions of Chen Xi and the others turned to extreme rage. Never had they imagined that Bing Shitian would actually intend to take Qing Xiuyi away with such forceful methods!</span></p>
