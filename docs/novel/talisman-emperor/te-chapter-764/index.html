 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked down at from midair, this mountain was like an 5,000km long enormous dragon residing on the ground. Its was winding like a serpent, covered in the violet qi of kings, and every time the sun rose, this mountain would be enveloped within a violet colored mist that was solemn, thick, and carried the aura of an emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Violet qi that came from the east; it was a rare paradise where Dragon Veins converged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan was situated here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bai Clan was an ancient clan whose history could be traced back to the primeval times, and its forces were so enormous and its foundation so thick that it was comparable to the 10 great immortal sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What people took the greatest delight in talking about was that the Bai Clan’s customs were very brutal. All the male children of the clan were like heroes that were upstanding, dauntless, and extraordinarily bold and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, the bodies of the members of the Bai Clan innately flowed with the blood of war, and they’d placed their gazes outside of the Dark Reverie and had advanced towards the Xeno-race a long time ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no reason but merely for the sake of battle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the thing that caused everyone in the world the greatest headache was this as well. The Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan loved battle and were extremely protective, so if someone dared to offend their Bai Clan, then there was utterly no need to care about if there was a reason because they would beat first and ask questions later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So if it was in terms of the most terrifying power to the people in the cultivation world, then it wasn’t the immortal sects, nor the demon sects, but the Bai Clan!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A robust and tall middle aged man squatted at the corner of the wall while his enormous hand held a large bowl. This large bowl was simply like a wooden basin, and within it was steaming white and jade-like noodles that were sprinkled with some verdant coriander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man’s face was craggy, his pitch black beard stood up straight like iron needles, and he was extremely heroic and unrestrained. He was gobbling down these noodles, and he was eating with extreme satisfaction to the point soup dripped from the corners of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, he’d finished the entire large bowl of noodles, and even the soup was swallowed entirely with a raise of the bowl. Only after he did all this did he smack his lips in a slightly unsatisfied manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he stood up to arrive at a 3m tall wooden bucket at the side before lifting up his chopsticks and filling another bowl of the noodles…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he squatted down at the corner and chowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He simply seemed like a laborer at the side of the road, like a hungry ghost that was reborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths on the martial practice grounds were already accustomed to this scene, and they didn’t even take a glance at the middle aged man as they tempered their bodies with concentration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These oldest amongst these youths were around 11 or 12, and the youngest were around eight or nine. Their upper bodies were laid bare, and every single one of them had strong physiques, bulging muscles, and seemed to be filled with explosive strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before every single youth was a pitch black and enormous rock that was like a small hill. This was a type of rock called Heavyhell Rock, and a fist sized piece of it was already over 1,500kg in weight. For example, the small hill sized Heavyhell Rock before these youths were probably no less than 1.5 million kilograms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But shockingly, these youths were able to casually lift up the Heavyhell Rock before them like they were lifting wooden sticks, and it seemed to be done easily and in a very relaxed manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some older youths even tossed the Heavyhell Rock repeatedly into the air, and it was simply as if they were playing ball. If this were to be seen by people of the outside world, their eyeballs would surely drop out of their sockets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the robust middle aged man at the corner of the wall similarly remained indifferent to this, and he enjoyed his noodles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a wave of rapid footsteps resounded out abruptly as a young man that wore a luxurious robe and a golden belt ran over and said, “Uncle, I’ve done what you asked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he took out a jade fan with a swish before fanning it repeatedly, and then he took out a white handkerchief with golden borders with his left hand and wiped the sweat of his forehead, causing him to seem exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Chen Xi was here, he would surely be able to recognize that this young man was Bai Gunan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pretentious fool!” The middle aged man remained squatted on the ground while he drank up the bowl of soup with a slurp, and then he glanced at Bai Gunan before passing the same judgment he usually did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan was embarrassed and very sensibly put away the jade fan and handkerchief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pretentious fool, what did you tell him?” The middle aged man put the bowl down and burped with satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I told him that Little Aunt will only be able to return 10 years from now, and he should remain calm.” Bai Gunan replied quickly, and then he asked. “Uncle, is Little Aunt fine in the battlefield outside the three dimensions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man laughed with ridicule. “What the fuck could happen to her? With Elder Teng following by her side, unless a Saint Emperor makes a move, otherwise who could harm her?” Even though his words were crude, they carried a convincing feeling of confidence and heroism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan was greatly reassured, and he let out a long sigh of relief. “That’s good. That fellow Chen Xi will probably be at ease this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man looked at him with surprise. “Pretentious fool, didn’t you think everyone in the world is an eyesore? Why have you actually started to be concerned about that kid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan said with displeasure, “Uncle, stop calling me pretentious fool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man nodded. “Alright, pretentious fool, it won’t be repeated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan. “…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, I do indeed think that those disciples of the 10 great immortal sects and six lineages of the devil sect are an eyesore. But only Chen Xi is special to me, and he’s worthy for me to associate with him. Coupled with his relationship with Little Aunt, I’ve already taken him to be a part of my family since a long time ago.” After a short moment, Bai Gunan spoke with a prideful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? What’s special about him?” The middle aged man asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do I say it? In any case, amongst all the people in the world, only he dares to beat me, and I feel he isn’t bad. He has backbone and is responsible.” Bai Gunan pondered for a moment before speaking in an extremely serious manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle aged man. “…”</span></p>

So he asked Chen Xi to stay calm and cultivate.</span></p>
