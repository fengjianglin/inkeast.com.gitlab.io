 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to what the old priest had said, this place was called the Ninth Hell, and it was separated from the world. It was a desolate place that had been abandoned by the Heaven Dao and forgotten by the myriad of beings in the three dimensions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But during the primeval times, it was surprisingly a place to pass down the Dao, and a god resided here, causing it to be a sacred place that was worshiped by all!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That god was the ancestor of the Ninth Hell clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, great chaos erupted in the three dimensions as 10 Xeno-race Saint Emperors led armies of Xeno-race experts to invade the three dimensions and launch an expedition against it. Blood dyed the sky red as countless saints and gods perished. In the end, the gods drove out the Xeno-race army from the three dimensions, and those Xeno-race Saint Emperors were completely suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since then, the three dimensions fell once more into peace. But after experiencing this great calamity, this Ninth Hell that a god resided in has transformed into a wasteland that was completely desolate. Everything within it had been annihilated, and it had suffered harm that was impossible to repair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, along with the passage of time, the Ninth Hell was abandoned by the Heaven Dao and forgotten by the myriad of beings in the three dimensions, and it was unable to fit in with any world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the Ninth Hell tribe had become the one and only group that lived here. It wasn’t that they weren’t willing to leave, but it was impossible to leave this place of death since they were born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. They’d searched for countless years yet were utterly incapable of finding the path that led to the outside world, and this sort of situation had continued for innumerable years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up until later on, they practically forgot the existence of the ‘outside world.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there was always an exception to everything. The favorable turn in this situation occurred three months ago when the ancestral grounds of the Ninth Hell tribe suddenly collapsed, and the dimensional walls were opened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, a group of Xeno-race experts with strange appearances gushed into this place. They were like devils that caused a rain of blood, and only the old priest, Meng Wei, Mo Ya, and the others from the Ninth Hell tribe that originally consisted of a million people survived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the lead of the old priest, Meng Wei and Mo Ya brought along a group of over 1,000 guards to send these almost 100 young children and youths away, and they started an arduous and dangerous long distance journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along the way, they were pursued, encircled, and experienced countless bloodshed. Up until now, only a mere nine people remained from the over 1,000 guards in the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the old priest has suffered a heavy injury as well, and he was already on the verge of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, along with the passage of time, the enemies that pursued them all along the way had gradually become fewer. In the past, they would be practically chased after by their enemies every single day, yet now, they hadn’t seen a trace of their enemies for almost half a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This allowed the old priest to relax. But their journey was still arduous to the extreme. Due to the lack of food and medicinal materials, they’d practically been moving forward while hungry all along the way because they didn’t dare waste even a single speck of food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the shortage of food and medicinal materials, there was another thing that caused the old priest to be even more worried, and that was how to leave the Ninth Hell and find a place for them to settle down and survive. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, survive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The over one million clansmen of the Ninth Hell tribe had used their blood and lives to provide a trace of hope to their efforts of fleeing from disaster. Now, only the old priest and a hundred plus people remained, and if they were unable to survive and multiply, their Ninth Hell clan would surely be obliterated from the world. Such an outcome was something none of them were willing to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right amidst this situation they were affected by internal and external troubles, Chen Xi had suddenly appeared, and even though he was heavily injured and on the verge of death, it allowed the old priest to once again see a trace of hope!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he’d discerned that Chen Xi wasn’t someone from the Ninth Hell and was absolutely not an invading enemy. He was from the outside world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, their final destination during this long journey was to head to the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that the old priest firmly felt that only Chen Xi was capable of leading them out of the Ninth Hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances and for the sake of repaying the old priest’s life saving grace, Chen Xi could only agree to the old priest’s request in the end, and he received control of the Ninth Hell tribe and temporarily assumed the position of the leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xeno-race have broken open the dimensional walls to invade the Ninth Hell, and they caused practically all the one million clansmen in the Ninth Hell tribe to be sacrificed. What’s their goal?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned, and then he suddenly recalled that while he was in the Door of Profundity and before the sacrificial altar, the mysterious white haired figure had once said that there were nine more mysterious places in the three dimensions besides the Dark Parasol’s Abyss that had a few of his companions trapped there. Moreover, they were about to escape soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Ninth Hell has been invaded by Xeno-race experts. It wouldn’t be one of those nine mysterious places that has a trapped Xeno-race Saint Emperor, right?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s heart felt even heavier when he thought like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s experienced the formidableness of a Xeno-race Saint Emperor. Even if it was under the condition of being weak, a Xeno-race Saint Emperor was actually almost able to suppress the tiny cauldron, and such terrifying might caused one’s heart to go cold just from the thought of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like I must do things carefully and recover my strength as soon as possible…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath as he discarded all the distracting thoughts in his head, and he stopped thinking any further and started inspecting his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within his body, under the nourishment of the Immortal Energy emitted by the Dark Parasol sapling, his damaged veins had already been repaired and healed. Unfortunately, the destroyed Dao Foundation within his Dantian showed no signs of turning for the better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a Dao Foundation, it meant that he was utterly unable to cultivate, let alone reconstruct his Blackhole World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Comparatively speaking, it was the injuries of his body that had healed much quicker. Presently, he’d already gradually recovered a trace of vitality and vigor, and he believed it wouldn’t be long before he would be able to cultivate the Universe Starslayer Bodyforging Technique and condense Shaman Energy once more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This allowed Chen Xi to heave a sigh of relief in his heart. Even though his qi refinement cultivation was gone, so long as his body refinement cultivation could recover, then he didn’t have to be too worried about his safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he took out a jade pot that seemed to be carved out from fine jade, and it emitted a rain of light while a sweet fragrance assaulted his nose. It was precisely the pot of divine wine he obtained in the Divine Palace of Creation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this half a month of time, due to his injuries being too severe while his body was too weak, Chen Xi utterly didn’t dare to utilize any spirit medicines to recuperate. After all, that level of medicinal strength was too violent and enormous for him right now, so consuming it would do more harm than good, and it might even be fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he could only rely on the pieces of meat and medicinal soup Xiao Yan fed him to replenish the water and energy in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he opened the jade pot, a sweet fragrance that touched the depths of his soul entered into his nose, and it caused the skin on his entire body to feel comfortable and filled with the yearning for strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t hesitate any longer. He took out a jade cup and carefully poured out a drop of divine wine before drinking it down in one gulp.</span></p>

He opened his palm and a string of red and glittering spirit fruits appeared in his palm. The spirit fruits were the size of longans and enshrouded with strands of spirit energy that seemed like mist, and a dense refreshing fragrance that assaulted the nose slowly dispersed out and spread towards the surroundings.</span></p>
