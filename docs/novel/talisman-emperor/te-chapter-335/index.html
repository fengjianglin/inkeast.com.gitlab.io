In just an instant, an area of 5km around the small hill was riddled in holes like a hornet’s nest, and it was in a state of devastation.</span></p>

They naturally wouldn’t just encircle him without attacking, and conversely, every single one of them executed their fiercest attacks that covered the heavens and the earth as it enveloped towards Chen Xi.</span></p>

It was like a volcano had erupted in the area of 300m in their surroundings as the earth quaked, causing it to be extremely terrifying.</span></p>

Everyone, could it be that all of you don’t think this is worthy of celebration?”</span></p>

What’s that?” At the instant everyone was laughing heartily and drinking wine, Daoist Long He unintentionally noticed that the surface of the Mirror of Exchange suddenly lit up with countless dazzling rays of starlight.</span></p>

At this moment, his entire body was burned black, his hair disheveled, and he seemed to be in an extremely sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when he saw the grand formation before him that was suffused with starlight, Chen Xi still revealed a slight smile.</span></p>

A grand formation could be used for defense, and it could be used for slaughter.</span></p>

Once cultivators fell into this grand formation, it would be as if they’d fallen into a boundless sea of stars. No matter how they flew or how they resisted, they would be unable to escape the restraint of this grand formation.</span></p>

The materials in Chen Xi’s possession and all the materials he’d gathered in Gloom Forest could only set up this formation. As for another large scale slaughter formation, even though he knew how to set up the grand formation, because he suffered from a lack of materials, he could only make do with the Boundless Starsea grand formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But its effects were similarly prominent. After he utilized the art of archery that he wasn’t skilled in to show weakness to his enemies, his enemies really acted as he’d expected. They thought he had nothing left up his sleeves and thought he was battling like a caged beast, and they pressed forward, yet they fell into the trap he’d set up since long ago in the end, causing them to turn from hunter into prey…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all the 105 assassins of the Blacksun Pavilion including Crimsonfox and Rose had fallen into the grand formation, and they would be absolutely unable to escape in a short period of time.</span></p>

Without dallying in the slightest, he drew the Staruin Bow right away before suddenly shooting out a shapeless arrow explosively. The arrow tore through the sky and carried an unparalleled force of impact, and it collided into the waterfall and shook it to the point rocks shattered and waves of water surged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Roar!” Right at this moment, a beast roar that shook the heavens resounded out. A wyrm that was enormous like a mountain, completely graphite colored, and covered in icy cold scales exploded out from the surface of the water as its enormous claw that was thick like a water barrel stretched out to the sky, and it searched for the provocateur that had the audacity to trespass upon its place of cultivation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely a terrifying flying beast. Everywhere it passed, space was slashed apart by its wings that were like blades and the terrifying airflow that it carried along with it was like a gale that swept away rocks and wood, and everything before its path transformed into ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi fled madly once again, and he arrived at another ferocious beast’s territory after a short while.</span></p>

A slap of its hand was capable of easily smashing a mountain into powder, and it was the absolute overlord of this area that not a single ferocious beast was capable of shaking.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, the entire Gloom Forest had become extremely chaotic. The wyrm that was enormous like a mountain, the flying beast with gorgeous wings, the hot-tempered and ferocious golden colored enormous ape… Over 10 overlords from various areas had been successfully infuriated by Chen Xi, and they went berserk in the forest as they carried out a pursuit.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked the other fierce beasts in Gloom Forest, causing all of them to be terrified and uneasy to the point of shivering. So many overlords moving out together caused them to feel as if the end of the world had arrived.</span></p>

The flower’s petals revealed strands of dark gold color and contained surging and shocking vitality, and it emitted a unique smell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant this scarlet red flower appeared in the air and its smell was inhaled by these ferocious beasts, their eyes were instantly filled with blood, and their gazes were filled with greed and burning desire. It seemed as if the flower in Chen Xi’s hand was a supreme delicacy of the world in their eyes, and it revealed a temptation that was difficult to refuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trace of a smile suffused the corners of Chen Xi’s mouth as he raised his hand and tossed this flower into the Boundless Starsea grand formation.</span></p>

When the other ferocious beasts saw this, they slightly hesitated before being unable to resist the temptation in the end, and all of them charged into the grand formation and instantly vanished without a trace.</span></p>

For the sake of making these ferocious beasts attack, a 10,000 year old Blood Nightmare Flower is gone just like that. But, so long as I’m able to use this to annihilate those assassins of the Blacksun Pavilion, then it would be worth the price I paid…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stood before the grand formation as he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.
