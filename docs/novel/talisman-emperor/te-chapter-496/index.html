 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que was stunned, and then he shook his head and said, “No, there hasn’t been anyone capable of breaking through the top 50 positions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So in this way, that fellow Feng Jianbai is still occupying the position of first?” Shang Kun seemed to have heaved a sigh of relief, but his eyelids couldn’t help but twitch when he mentioned the name Feng Jianbai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que nodded, and his expression was slightly heavy as an extremely proud and aloof figure couldn’t help but appear in his mind. Feng Jianbai, a disciple of the Skycloud Kingdom’s Feng Clan, possessed a cultivation at the 6<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;tempering of the Rebirth Realm, and he was born with a pair of Phantom Eyes that were extremely terrifying and capable of seeing through a myriad of techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Once I successfully cultivate the Chaotic Devilbody, then no matter how formidable his Phantom Eyes are, they would be useless against me. At that time, I only have to defeat him and I’ll be the number one figure in the Primeval Battlefield, and the emissaries of the Dark Reverie would surely pay special attention to me when they arrive.” Shang Kun grunted coldly as he spoke with a ghastly voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que smiled and was just about to speak when his gaze shot towards the outside of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, Young Master, Chen Xi has appeared!” Right at this moment, a figure swiftly appeared outside the hall and spoke excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Chen Xi!?” Shang Kun swiftly turned around, and arcs of lightning exploded out from his eyes as they blinked. “Good! Very Good! He has really come to help me in a timely manner, hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shang Qing, what’re you standing there for, quickly report everything you know to the Young Master.” Shang Que’s face was suffused with a wisp of a smile as well, and he couldn’t help but berate with a frown when he glanced over and saw that the person who came to report was standing there like an idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Qing hurriedly nodded and spoke about everything that had occurred outside the city gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s with the Dartang Dynasty’s Ling Ze?” Shang Kun frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, Ling Ze’s strength is formidable, and he’s ranked the 24<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;on the Warsoul Tablet. He’s considered to be one of the pillars of support of the Dartang Dynasty.” Shang Que swiftly explained at the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Could it be that he doesn’t know that the northwest area of Primeval City is the territory of my Shang Clan? He’s really courting death.” Shang Kun laughed coldly as he waved his hand and instructed. “People that have just arrived at Primeval City would surely head to the Warsoul Tablet at the central area to measure their combat strength, and Chen Xi will surely be no exception. Shang Que, bring a few more people along and see exactly how formidable that kid Chen Xi’s combat strength is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke up to here, Shang Kun’s eyes were suffused with a dim blue glow, causing him to seem extremely calm and terrifying. “That kid has overcome the Phoenix Tribulation of Rebirth. Even though he has just advanced to the Rebirth Realm, his strength and potential can’t be underestimated. Carefully pay attention to him, and you must absolutely not allow any mishaps to occur.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, Young Master. Leave this matter to me.” Shang Que smiled confidently, and then he asked. “Young Master, should we make a move and annihilate Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not for now. Presently, there are too many people in Primeval City that want to kill Chen Xi, and it’s sufficient to let others do it for us. There’s no need to make our own people take the risk.” Shang Kun’s gaze was dim as he said, “Perhaps others would look down on this kid because he’s from an ordinary Dynasty, but I won’t. Conversely, in my opinion, this kid is extremely extraordinary, and he’s a dangerous figure that must be dealt with carefully. So it’s best to be slightly more careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que was stunned as it was the first time he’d heard his Young Master have such a high evaluation of someone, and the trace of underestimation towards Chen Xi in his heart had vanished instantly without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go on. There are another three more months before the final test begins. I’m entirely capable of waiting for Chen Xi to be killed by the others before cultivating the Chaotic Devilbody, and I won’t take the risk personally.” Shang Kun held his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Of course, if his display is too inferior, then I’ll capture him alive myself before killing him right before Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que didn’t speak any further, and he left after receiving his orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the Young Master already had a plan in his heart. At this moment, he only had to act according to the will of his Young Master and there would absolutely be no mistakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, all of you must be careful. The disciples of the Shang Clan seem to have noticed your existence since long ago, and you have to be on guard against them.” They’d just walked out of the city when Ling Ze frowned while sending a voice transmission because Shang Ping’s attitude from before had caused him to faintly notice that something was off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Ling, don’t worry, I know.” Chen Xi smiled lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ze nodded and changed the topic. “Let’s go. Cultivators that have just arrived at Primeval City would surely head to the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet at the center of the city to measure their combat strength. Let’s go over and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet?!” Huangfu Qingying and the others were shocked and seemed to have never imagined that such a treasure actually existed in Primeval City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi wasn’t one with shallow knowledge any longer, so he had a rather good understanding of the Warsoul Tablet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Supposedly, there were three exalted Emperors with extremely great fortune during the Primordial Era, and they were respectively the Equipment Emperor, Martial Emperor, and Spirit Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Equipment Emperor gathered Chaotic Divinestones from the absolute beginning of the world and spent a few thousands of years to refine 99,999 Dao Measuring Stones, and then he distributed it throughout the myriad of worlds to become the Saint Artifact that measured Dao Insight in the three dimensions. This sort of stone was called the Equipment Emperor’s Dao Measuring Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Martial Emperor wandered the three dimensions and was moved by how cultivators in the world cultivated blindly, yet didn’t know exactly how formidable their strengths were or how great their potentials were, causing them to go onto the wrong path in the end before perishing on the path to the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he utilized his supreme ability to split out a myriad of strands of his Warsoul before sealing them within stone tablets that stood towering in the myriad of worlds in the universe. He did this all for the sake of allowing cultivators to sense the formidableness of their own strengths through the stone tablets and encourage them to cultivate, so as to avoid them being lost on the path to the Dao. This tablet was called the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet, and it was extremely miraculous and capable of detecting the strength possessed by cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Emperor had compiled two rankings instead, the Martial Technique Gold Rankings and Divine Ability Gold Rankings of the three dimensions. These two rankings gathered all the Dao Grade martial techniques and Divine Abilities in the three dimensions before ranking them according to their might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most miraculous part about these rankings was that every time another Dao Grade martial technique or Divine Ability appeared in the three dimensions, it would automatically appear in the rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regretfully, those two rankings had vanished without a trace after the Spirit Emperor vanished. Supposedly, it was taken by the Immortal Dimension, whereas some people say it was taken control of by some great power. In short, these two miraculous rankings hadn’t appeared in the world for an extremely long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the contributions of the three Emperors to all the beings in the three dimensions. No matter if it was the Equipment Emperor’s Dao Measuring Stone, the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet, or the Martial Technique and Divine Ability Gold Rankings of the three dimensions, all of them had brought extremely great benefits to all the myriad of beings in the three dimensions while establishing their reputation that would remain eternal. Thus, it could be said that the three Emperors had done a great service to every being in the three dimensions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had once seen the Equipment Emperor’s Dao Measuring Stone in Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault. At that time, he was extremely shocked by the Equipment Emperor’s extravagance and great resolution. Now, when he heard that a Saint Artifact like the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet actually existed within Primeval City, he was extremely shocked and curious in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. The prerequisite to participating in the final test of the Primeval Battlefield is to pass the test of the Warsoul Tablet. In other words, only by passing such a test would one possess the qualifications to participate in the final test.” Ling Ze smiled as he explained. “Three months from now, the emissaries of the Dark Reverie will arrive at Primeval City. At that time, they’ll distribute command tokens of different grades according to everyone’s rankings on the Warsoul Tablet.”</span></p>

Then how are the grades of those command tokens differentiated?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The command tokens are divided into the heaven, earth, profound, and yellow grades. Yellow was the most inferior, and heaven was the most superior. According to my deduction based on experience from the past, those that are able to obtain a heaven grade command token are basically those that are able to be ranked in the top 50 on the Warsoul Tablet.” &nbsp;Ling Ze smiled lightly as he said, “It’s too troublesome to explain. In any case, all of you just have to understand that it’s better the higher your ranking on the Warsoul Tablet is. Perhaps, you might even be directly taken a fancy upon by an extraordinary power of the Dark Reverie and be directly taken as a disciple.”</span></p>

Moreover, the closer one got to the central area, the more Rebirth Realm experts one would see.</span></p>

The cultivation of the experts that’re capable of arriving here have already arrived at a rather high level.</span></p>

The stone tablet was 3km in height and seemed like a precipitous mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stone tablet’s entire body was suffused with a golden glow, while dense bright lights covered its surface before condensing into circle after circle of golden ripples that emitted a dazzling and resplendent brilliance that was striking to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were already numerous cultivators that had rushed over in the surroundings of the stone tablet while shadows flickered about. Some of them were measuring their own strengths, some were observing the line after line of rankings that flickered with a golden sheen on the surface of the stone tablet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;As he looked at the vast and brilliant stone tablet and felt the terrifying fluctuation emitted from it, Chen Xi couldn’t help but exclaim repeatedly with admiration. It was truly difficult for him to image exactly what sort of strength one had to attain to be able to refine such a miraculous Saint Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, that’s the Martial Emperor’s Warsoul Tablet. So long as you experience its measuring, your name will automatically appear on the tablet. At the same time, the stone tablet will also measure your strength and even potential before using it to determine your ranking. The higher one’s ranking is, the more formidable one’s strength and potential was.” Ling Ze pointed towards the enormous stone tablet in the distance as he smiled.</span></p>

It’s a Saint Artifact personally refined by the Martial Emperor, and its value is so great that it isn’t inferior to an Immortal Artifact!” Ling Ze sighed emotionally with a light voice, and then he shook his head and said, “Let’s go over as well and see exactly what sort of ranking everyone is able to obtain. If you’re able to rank in the top 50, then you absolutely possess the qualifications to obtain a Dark Reverie Token.”</span></p>
