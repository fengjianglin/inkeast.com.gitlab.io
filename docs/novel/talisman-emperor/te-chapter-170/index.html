 <p>Chapter 170 – Nine-Yang Profound Qi</p>
 <p>The great hall on True Heart Peak.</p>
 <p>Bei Heng, Ling Kongzi, Xuan Jing, Qing Qiu, and Chen Xi sat on the floor. Because of Chen Xi’s status being too special, there was no differentiation between their seating, and it could be considered to be communication on equal grounds.</p>
 <p>Of course, Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei were present as well, but their seniority was too low after all, and when they were in a room of Seniors, they consciously sat at a lower place and could only shut their mouths and listen respectfully.</p>
 <p>The reason Bei Heng came over this time was extremely simple. He’d heard earlier that Chen Xi was about to advance to the Golden Hall Realm, yet didn’t possess a suitable cultivation technique. So he immediately sent over a carefully picked precious qi refinement cultivation technique, the Blackhole Void Technique, that contained the method to cultivate from the Golden Hall Realm to the Earthly Immortal Realm, and it was an extremely profound Daoist Inheritance Secret Technique.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was naturally greatly delighted when he saw this, and he didn’t hesitate in the slightest to receive it.</p>
 <p>During these five years, he’d sat there cultivating the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, silently immersed into the boundlessly vast deducing of the sword moves, and his cultivation could be said to have not improved in the slightest, causing his body refinement and qi refinement cultivation to have stagnated at the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the Ice Crane Technique he cultivated only possessed the cultivation technique for the nine levels of the Violet Palace Realm, and after he advanced to the Golden Hall Realm, the matter of top priority was to choose a qi refinement cultivation technique. As for a body refinement cultivation technique, he only needed to enter the Abode once more and Ji Yu would naturally pass it down to him.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of this that Bei Heng gifting this Blackhole Void Technique to him could be said to have solved Chen Xi’s top priority need, causing him to be overjoyed.</p>
 <p>When he saw Chen Xi was pleased, Bei Heng felt extremely delighted as well, and he felt that his effort wasn’t expended for nothing. This Blackhole Void Technique wasn’t part of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s inheritance, and it was instead something he found from the secret realm of a Daoist Sect that was about to be annihilated during his travels. Every phrase within it was profound and unfathomable, but due to it being in conflict with the cultivation technique he used, he’d instead never cultivated it. Giving it to Chen Xi could be considered to be making the best use of it and obtaining more than it was worth.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Ling Kongzi had naturally come over for the sake of allowing the two demon kings, Xuan Jing and Qing Qiu, to meet with Chen Xi and catch up. Presently, Xuan Jing and Qing Qiu had joined the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. The True Essence in their entire bodies was dense, and their cultivations had even attained the Rebirth Realm. Their addition had greatly strengthened the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s strength. Of course, Ling Kongzi understood as well, that to a great extent, the reason these two demon kings chose to join the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect was Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>Exactly, it was indeed because of Chen Xi.</p>
 <p>Since Chen Xi gathered the River Diagram fragment from the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, the cultivation of these two demon kings wasn’t restrained any longer, and their cultivation that had been accumulated for a few tens of thousands of years rose violently all the way, allowing them to attain the Rebirth Realm in only a few years of time.</p>
 <p>It could be said that if it wasn’t for Chen Xi, the two of them could only stagnate at the Violet Palace Realm for their entire lifetimes, and in the end, they would die with regret because of their lifespan drying up. Chen Xi’s help to them was same as the grace of rebirth, so how could they possibly forget this favor?</p>
 <p>Coupled with the two of them wandering all over during these past few years had caused them to deeply understand that with their individual strength, it was extremely difficult to advance to a higher realm of cultivation. So they intended to choose a sect to join. Right at that moment, Chen Xi had obtained the first in the Hidden Dragon Ranking, and the news of him being sword brothers with the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s Supreme Elder Bei Heng seemed as if it had grown wings as it spread throughout the entire southern territory, and it naturally entered into the ears of these two demon kings. Thus the two of them decided right away to join the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect!</p>
 <p>On one hand, they could rely on their relationship with Chen Xi to obtain a good position in the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, and on the other hand, joining a formidable sect like the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect wouldn’t bring shame to their identities. It was precisely because of these reasons that Xuan Jing and Qing Qiu appeared before Chen Xi today.</p>
 <p>Old friends reuniting was naturally an extremely joyful occasion, and they drank wine and chatted cheerfully. When they saw this, Bei Heng and Ling Kongzi didn’t disturb them, and they instead chatted idly for a while before leaving quietly.</p>
 <p>“Chen Xi, a few years ago, Big Brother Xuan Jing had once secretly made a divination for you. He said your fate is peculiar, rarely seen in an eternity, and it’s actually concealed by the Grand Dao and secrets of the heaven. He wasn’t able to divine any good or bad luck, and it’s truly strange!” When he’d drunk to the point of being slightly drunk, Qing Qiu’s peach blossom shaped eyes narrowed as he spoke abruptly.</p>
 <p>“Right, it’s indeed so.” Xuan Jing stared fixedly at Chen Xi as he sighed. “That divination consumed 100 years of my lifespan, and not only was I unable to divine any good or bad luck, I instead almost suffered backlash from the divination and lost my life. Little Brother, I was originally thinking that I could rely on my divination arts to guide you on an easy path to the Grand Dao if I met you, but now it would seem that the peculiarity of your fate has already been concealed by the secrets of the heaven, and it’s utterly not something a small figure like me is able to pry into.”</p>
 <p>Chen Xi was stunned. He knew that Xuan Jing’s body contained that bloodline of the Old Turtle Clan that had been inherited from the primordial era, causing Xuan Jing to innately have great knowledge on divination, and Xuan Jing was especially skilled in the art of observing one’s fate. So if he said so, then wouldn’t it prove that this matter was true?</p>
 <p>During his five years of deducing the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, Chen Xi had a slight understanding towards the variations in divination. He knew that the past, present, future, and various variables in the life of a being in the heaven and earth existed in its fate, luck, appearance, and karma. It was precisely because of this that when he found out his fate was actually unable to be deduced that the shock in his heart was so obvious.</p>
 <p>But the so-called fate was similar to destiny and karmic luck, and it was too illusory. It was like a flower in a mirror, the moon in the water, and it was difficult to fathom. Although Chen Xi didn’t believe in it completely, he wouldn’t pay too much attention to it. Moreover, he’d always firmly believed that fate was decided by the heavens, yet it was controlled in one’s own hands, whether it was fortune or disaster would depend on how one dealt with it.</p>
 <p>So this trace of shock flashed within his heart, yet didn’t cause the slightest ripple.</p>
 <p>“Right, I heard that you intend to leave and gain experience and tempering after attending the ceremony, and you intend to participate in the Allstar Meeting five years from now?” Xuan Jing hurriedly changed the topic when he saw the atmosphere had become slightly depressing.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, right, there’s still another five years, yet I’m only at the Violet Palace Realm now. Only by wandering about outside to gain experience and tempering would I be able to advance my cultivation extremely quickly amongst life and death battles.” Chen Xi nodded.</p>
 <p>“It’s indeed so. Cultivating behind closed doors is inferior to walking a great distance. As the saying goes, fortune and fortuitous encounters can only be encountered while one is on a journey of gaining tempering and experience. Presently, you’re about to advance to the Golden Hall Realm and have to start absorbing the Yin and Yang qi of the heaven and earth to temper your True Essence, and circulate the Yin and Yang within your body to make preparations for advancing to the Golden Core Realm. I feel that you ought to make a trip to the Oceanic Desert that’s called the place of death.” Xuan Jing grinned as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Oceanic Desert?” Chen Xi was stunned. He’d never imagined that Xuan Jing would actually speak of such a place. After all, when he was chased after by the Su Clan cultivators, he’d once helplessly entered the Oceanic Desert, and not only had he obtained a great amount of Starsoul Meteorites, he’d even entered the Sword Tomb Nirvana Realm and become acquainted with Ling Bai…</p>
 <p>“Indeed. The Oceanic Desert is a battlefield of gods and devils from a few tens of thousands of years ago. Although gales rage, sandstorms howl, and there’re even spatial tears and restrictions that are extremely terrifying within it, there’re also countless amounts of secret realms, abodes, and mysterious hidden locations between space. I and Qing Qiu had once entered the Oceanic Desert a few years ago, and we noticed a cavern that contained boundless Nine-Yang Profound Qi beside the lava of a volcano that erupted all year long. If you’re able to cultivate there, then you’ll surely improve with amazing speed.”</p>
 <p><em>Nine-Yang Profound Qi!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Xi’s heart was instantly moved when he heard this.</p>
 <p>The Golden Hall Realm was the absorption of the energy of Yin and Yang in the heaven and earth to temper the True Essence within the body, causing Yin and Yang to gather within and promote the generation of spirit and essence. The energy of Yin and Yang in the heaven and earth was divided into a few hundred types of different variety, and these energies filled lava, beneath the city, the center of a rock, and even within the Inner Core and body of a demon beast.</p>
 <p>Amongst them, the Nine-Yang and Nine-Yin Profound Qi possess the highest quality, and it practically represented the quintessence energy of the Yin and Yang energy in the entire heaven and earth. If Golden Hall Realm cultivators were able to use these Profound Qis that represented the extremes of Yin and Yang to temper their True Essence, then the quality of the person's True Essence and the speed of the person’s cultivation would far exceed other Golden Hall Realm cultivators. Most importantly, when the cultivator condensed their golden core, the cultivator’s assurance in being successful would be improved by an entire 50%!</p>
 <p>But the Nine-Yang and Nine-Yin Profound Qis were indeed extremely rare in the world, and they belonged to the divine items that could only be found by luck yet not sought after. Now, when he heard that the Oceanic Desert actually possessed the Nine-Yang Profound Qi within it, how could Chen Xi not be moved?</p>
 <p><em>I need to condense my golden core within five years to participate in the Allstar Meeting, so I must first charge through to the Golden Hall Realm. If I’m able to possess the Nine-Yang Profound Qi to temper my True Essence, then it’ll surely be able to yield twice the results. &nbsp;Looks like it’s imperative that I head to the Oceanic Desert…&nbsp;</em>Chen Xi pondered silently before deciding right away that he would depart right after the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s entrance test ended to head to the Oceanic Desert.</p>
 <p>After chatting idly for another period of time, Xuan Jing and Qing Qiu bid their farewells successively, and only Chen Xi, Mu Yao, and Mu Wenfei remained in the great hall.</p>
 <p>Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei had both advanced to the Violet Palace Realm after experiencing these five years of cultivation, and they could be said to have improved at an amazing speed that caused one to exclaim with admirations. It could be seen from this that during their cultivation in the Du Clan, with the care of Du Qingxi, the treatment they received was surely not inferior to the other top disciples. But the two of them weren’t Du Clan members after all, so no one was able to say anything about them choosing the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect as the place they would cultivate at in the future.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi chatted with the two of them for a very long time before arranging for them to stay in the guest hall, and he agreed that he would bring along the two of them to participate in the sect entrance test tomorrow at dawn.</p>
 <p>The night passed peacefully.</p>
 <p>At dawn, Chen Xi had woken up early in the morning, and he practiced in his sword technique for a while after washing up before bringing Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei along as he left True Heart Peak.</p>
 <p>The first light of dawn was revealed into the sky, the mountain covered in mist that was thick like smoke, and the clear cries of birds could be heard everywhere as red-crowned cranes fluttered in the sky.</p>
 <p>At this moment, it was already extremely bustling with noise and excitement before the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect’s entrance, and it was a clamorous scene of a sea of people.</p>
 <p>Presently, the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect was already the indisputable number one sect in the southern territory’s cultivation world, and it stood at the top with its extraordinary power. It was the holy land of cultivation in the hearts of countless young talents, and they yearned to become a member of the sect.</p>
 <p>Because of this, the young men and young women that had come over to participate in the sect entrance test were innumerable, coupled with the family members, seniors, and guards that followed these young men and young women, and the ambassadors that came to attend the ceremony from the other sects. The entire Wanderingcloud Sword Sect had simply turned into a sea that was formed by streams of people, and it was an unprecedentedly grand and magnificent scene.</p>
 <p>Om! Om! Om!</p>
 <p>Atop the entrance to the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect, the enormous ‘sword bell’ resounded three times, seeming like a morning bell that resounded in the heaven and earth, and the sect entrance test officially began.</p>
 <p>The sect entrance test of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect had been developed from a few tens of thousand years of growth, and it had already become extremely perfect and precise. It was divided into four items, namely age, comprehension ability, constitution, and will.</p>
 <p>Every item had elders and disciples that specialized in carrying out and managing it. Moreover, for the sake of saving time, practically all the elders of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect had moved out, and they jointly tested the young talents that had come to register themselves. The speed of their testing and even the order seemed to be perfect.</p>
 <p>Chen Xi thought for a moment and didn’t head to the viewing hall where all the guests that came to attend the ceremony were at, and he instead brought along Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei to step through the entrance and head towards the place that the sect entrance test was being held.</p>
 <p>While the three of them were waiting in the crowd, there were already more than a few hundred young men and young women that had been mercilessly eliminated, and all of the had dispirited and dejected expressions, causing the silent atmosphere in the surroundings to carry a wave of oppression.</p>
 <p>When they saw this scene, Mu Yao and Mu Wenfei instantly became nervous as well. Because Chen Xi had already told them before coming here that he wouldn’t look after the two of them during the sect entrance test this time. It completely relied on their own ability, they could stay if they passed and if they didn’t… Chen Xi didn’t clearly say what would happen, but it was precisely because of this that the pair of brother and sister had instead become nervous.</p>
