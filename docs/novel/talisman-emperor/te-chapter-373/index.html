 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Jingtian, Daoist Long He, Mo Lanhai, Chong Xu the Unfettered, Lord Liu Xiao, and Zhao Zimei had a rather gloomy expression, and their eyes were like swords as they glanced coldly at Bei Heng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the Earthly Immortal Realm experts present here had heard of Chen Xi’s name. The reason was extremely simple: the matter of Huangfu Jingtian and the others entrusting the Blacksun Pavilion with the task of assassinating Chen Xi by ambush was too stirring, and it was impossible to conceal even if they wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had heard of the reason for the ambush. They heard that it was because Chen Xi possessed a few Immortal Artifacts and had obtained numerous treasures from Qian Yuan’s Treasure Vault in the depths of the Oceanic Desert. Huangfu Jingtian and the others originally wanted to forcibly take possession of it, yet for some unknown reason, they came back empty handed in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew of this in their hearts, yet if they were to speak of it, it would probably damage the reputation of Huangfu Jingtian and the others, and that was something that would offend them. All of them had lived for countless years, so they naturally understood this principle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So during the conversations earlier, they’d intentionally avoided Chen Xi’s name so as to avoid causing these six people to be displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, Bei Heng had spoken of Chen Xi’s name as soon as he opened his mouth, and it had undoubtedly broken through this window screen and exposed the embarrassing scars of these six people, so the atmosphere naturally became silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Heng’s heart constricted when he felt the changes in the atmosphere, and his expression became slightly unnatural, but he didn’t regret mentioning Chen Xi’s name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi? I’ve heard of this kid’s name as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Civil Marquis swept everyone with his gaze and seemed to have not noticed the changes in the atmosphere as he grinned. “He’s a young expert that obtained the one and only 100 successive victories in the Goldlake Meeting, and he’s the one and only young man from the southern territory’s cultivation world that obtained such an accomplishment. Truly extraordinary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked at each other, yet no one replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of Huangfu Jingtian and the others grew even more gloomy. As far as they were concerned, the Civil Marquis was obviously intentionally doing this for the sake of embarrassing them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But for fear of the Civil Marquis’s identity, they were forced to keep their indignation to themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Civil Marquis didn’t care about the attitudes of everyone, and his smile remained as he continued asking with interest. “Fellow Daoist Bei Heng, can you point out which one is Chen Xi? So that I can properly witness his graceful bearing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Heng acutely noticed that the Civil Marquis seemed to be intentionally irritating Huangfu Jingtian, and he couldn’t help but be curious in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why’s he doing this? Could it be that the Civil Marquis wants to take my sworn brother in?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Civil Marquis, please look over there. That tall young man in azure clothes is my sworn brother, Chen Xi.” Even though he was curious in his heart, Bei Heng still stretched out his hand to point towards the distant Ascension Peak and replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“27km?” The Civil Marquis swept the Ascension Peak and was stunned, and then he said with surprise, “Even though the height he’s at can’t compare with the others, his speed contains great secrets. It’s neither fast nor slow, of constant distance, and his expression is relaxed. Obviously, he isn’t suffering from much Dao Insight pressure, and according to this momentum, he’d be able to surpass the others very soon.” As he spoke up to here, his voice revealed a trace of praise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Earthly Immortal Realm experts present looked over in succession, and they rather agreed with the Civil Marquis’s views.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their gazes were extremely experienced and discerned that even though the speed Chen Xi movement on Ascension Peak wasn’t swift, yet his bearing was unhurried as he moved neither too fast nor too slow, and he was moving up at all times without stopping in the slightest. Compared to the sorry and difficult state everyone else that was climbing Ascension Peak was in, he was obviously countless times more brilliant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kid’s strength is really extraordinary!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Earthly Immortal Realm experts had only heard of Chen Xi’s name, and they were extremely surprised in their hearts when they saw him now. But for fear of hurting the face of Huangfu Jingtian and the others, no one spoke out about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, an enormous bang sounded out in the hall, and it caused everyone to be startled. When they turned around to look, they saw that Bei Heng had suddenly smashed apart the table before him, and his entire face was livid as if he was furious to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, look at the height of 30km up Ascension Peak!” Bei Heng pointed at the distant Ascension Peak and gritted his teeth. “They’re an entire 13 people, yet they’ve obstructed my sworn brother’s path. Obviously, they have malicious intent and want to do evil. Such methods are simply despicable and filthy to the extreme!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked over. Sure enough, just as Bei Heng had said, there were 13 young disciples obstructing Chen Xi’s path, and the confrontational situation where both parties were ready to fight could be discerned by anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they recognized the identities of those 13 disciples, everyone instantly understood why Bei Heng would be furious, and if it was them, they’d probably be unable to control the flames of rage in their hearts as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simply, these 13 people were all disciples that belonged to the sects of Huangfu Jingtian and the others, and even an idiot would be able to discern that this was a scheme of revenge of the six powers against Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps, it was even Huangfu Jingtian and the others that got these 13 people to do that…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Civil Marquis couldn’t help but frown, but he didn’t say anything. This was the Allstar Meeting, and so long as one didn’t break the rules, then no one could say anything about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Fellow Daoist Bei Heng, your words are mistaken. If one wants to pass through the test of the Ascension Peak, only strength is not enough, it tests one’s disposition and intelligence to a higher degree. If one wishes to surpass others, how could it be possible without possessing some strategic ability and wisdom?” Huangfu Jingtian suddenly started laughing loudly as he spoke with a voice that was like rumbling thunder that resounded throughout the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Since the beginning, the Allstar Meeting was bound to be a brutal competition. If everyone stuck to established practices and held kind thoughts in their hearts, then how could this competition select true experts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. Everything depends on one’s own strength and wisdom. So long as it doesn’t violate the rules, any actions are allowed. Even if he’s killed, he deserves it, and he can’t resent anyone. After all, there were numerous people that died tragically in the battles of the previous Allstar Meetings!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoist Long He, Mo Lanhai, Zhao Zimei, and the others spoke out in succession, their eyes were like swords that contained oppressive coldness, and all of them stared at Bei Heng with an icy cold and disdainful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Heng’s expression was livid, and he was angered to the point of trembling, yet he was incapable of refuting it. Because what these old bastards said was the truth. Not to mention over 10 people besieging a single person, even matters of over 100 people besieging a single person had occurred in the previous Allstar Meetings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, quickly! The battle has started!” One of the Earthly Immortal Realm experts spoke out, and it instantly drew the gazes of everyone towards Ascension Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Despicable!”</span></p>

They simply have no sense of shame!”&nbsp;</span></p>

They felt it was unexpected because Chen Xi’s speed was too swift, and the strength Chen Xi struck with was too terrifying as well, causing them to not even have the time to counterattack before losing two companions.</span></p>

He was worried that these fellows would flee without putting up a fight, and that would be too much of a pity. Presently, they actually were still able to muster up the courage to charge over, so how could he not be delighted?</span></p>

Every single strike that swept out would surely bring about a string of blood that took away a person’s life.</span></p>

Dao Insight pressure was present everywhere on Ascension Peak, causing these people to have no choice but to divert more than half of their strengths to resist this pressure, so the strength they were able to exert was probably less than 30% of their normal strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, he was different.
