 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. Firstly, this place was safe, and he didn’t have to be worried about being disturbed by the outside world. Secondly, the Temporal Laws here were different to the outside world, and only a year passed by in the outside world from cultivating 10 years here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though the world of stars was conducive to his cultivation, yet it possessed a flaw that was impossible to overlook when compared to the abode he had in the outside world. The world of stars wasn’t like the abode, and it didn’t possess extremely vast and thick spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So after fully considering the advantages and disadvantages, Chen Xi decided to comprehended Dao Arts of Divine Abilities in the world of stars. After all, just comprehending cultivation techniques didn’t require spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, only when he was solidifying his cultivation and advancing it would he choose to cultivate within his own abode. In this way, he could fully utilize the advantage of the Crimson Origin Spirit Vein and allow it to provide him with boundless spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, countless tiny apertures suddenly opened up all over his body, and it was like numerous stars had lit up all around his body and emitted blazing rays of light. When looked at carefully, those numerous tiny apertures were like numerous profound little worlds that were magnificent and mysterious, and they seemed to contain the boundless profundities of the Grand Dao in the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As far as body refiners were concerned, the body was a land of treasures that contained the boundless profundities of the world. So long as one opened all 840 million tiny apertures in the body, one’s body would become immortal, eternal, and exist forever in the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Chen Xi’s body refinement cultivation hadn’t attained that practically legendary height, it had attained the height of the Rebirth Realm. His body was comparable to a top-grade heaven-rank magic treasure, causing it to be impregnable, and he’d already developed 21,000 tiny apertures in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, he wanted to utilize these mysterious tiny apertures to cultivate the Divine Ability, Wings of Disruption!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strand of hazy grey colored Profound Disruption Divinelight floated out and caused circle after circle of spatial ripples to undulate in the sky with a shocking impetus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi suddenly opened his eyes and circulated the cultivation technique while his hands overlapped swiftly with each other, and he struck out a string of obscure seals with a speed that dazzled the eyes. After that, the Profound Disruption Divinelight seemed as if it was summoned and transformed into an expanse of hazy grey colored rain of light that poured down onto the tiny apertures on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This step was called the refinement of energy, and it was a key step in cultivating the Wings of Disruption. The Profound Disruption Divinelight was placed into the 18,000 tiny apertures around the body to form a mysterious circulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Profound Disruption Divinelight had transformed into a rain of light that poured down and flowed into the tiny apertures around his body, and then they slowly creeped about before gradually boiling, causing his entire body to seem like a brightly glowing sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Chen Xi felt a sharp pain that penetrated the heart and marrow, and it caused his body to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the tiny apertures around his body rumbled like lightning from the nine heavens, and it seemed like resonance of the Grand Dao, causing it to emit an extremely grand aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sharp pain coiled around his body while his tiny apertures rumbled. Chen Xi felt as if something wanted to drill its way out of his back, and it felt like the pain of a myriad of swords stabbing his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack! Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right amidst this boundless pain, inch after inch of skin on his back cracked apart to form numerous bloody lines, and these lines coiled together, overlapped with each other, and were interwoven together in an extremely mysterious and profound way…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They actually gradually formed the shape of a pair of wings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi utilized his internal vision and couldn’t help but be enlightened because he deduced that the mysterious pattern that appeared on his back was shockingly the Wings of Disruption condensed from the Profound Disruption Divinelight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was only the form of it, those profound lines and curves and the mysterious striations seemed like the brand of the Grand Dao, and they revealed an unparalleled feeling of mysteriousness. Moreover, they possessed an aura of suppressing the five elements and breaking the shackles of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was sufficient to make other body refiners exclaim with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected of a great Divine Ability that’s ranked in the top 30 of the Divine Ability Gold Rankings of the three dimensions. Once it’s condensed, it actually possesses this unique and vast aura, causing it to seem extremely extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was too different from other Divine Abilities. Even though commonly seen Divine Abilities were miraculous, yet could any one of them directly fuse Profound Disruption Divinelight into the body and temper the body like the Wings of Disruption?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the Deity Transformation, Heavenly Transformation, Eye of Divine Truth, Grand Astral Palm, Starsky Wings, Stellar Lightningform… Even though all these Divine Abilities were formidable, yet they didn’t require external things like Profound Disruption Divinelight to be cultivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this didn’t mean that the Wings of Disruption was more formidable than these other Divine Abilities, and it could merely show that this ultimate Divine Ability that came from the Azure Phoenix Clan was extremely special.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was precisely because of this ‘specialness’ that made this Divine Ability shock the primeval times and create such a brilliant and illustrious reputation. It was even to the extent that one could bluntly say that this Divine Ability would cause monstrous waves in the world every single time it made an appearance, and its might could be said to be unprecedented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, Chen Xi had merely condensed the shape of the Wings of Disruption, whereas the hazy grey Profound Disruption Divinelight was still ceaselessly flowing and gushing into his tiny apertures before condensing without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time flowed by. Three days later, Chen Xi’s back was covered in innumerable marks of blood, and the bloody marks that were dense and complicated like the milky way seemed like someone had inscribed an extremely complicated ‘talisman of blood’ on his back. Some of the bloody marks had already formed scabs since long ago, whereas some bloody marks were still surging ceaselessly and spreading…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another three days of time passed. Suddenly, an extremely heavy and terrifying fluctuation swiftly stretched out from Chen Xi’s body. Everywhere it passed, space shook like tidewater and emitted intense swishing sounds, and it was on the verge of shattering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, a grey light flashed, and a pair of wings silently unfolded on Chen Xi’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An outline that was slender and sharp like blades, an arc that was simple and clean to the extreme, and an obscure aura that was grey and hazy like chaos. The wings seemed to be over 30m long when unfolded, yet it possessed an immense aura of being linked to the boundless space and covering an enormous expanse of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, there were unfathomable and profound talisman markings flickering and being produced on the wings, and they seemed to be narrating the profundities of the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi exclaimed endlessly with admiration in his heart. He’d been observing this pair of wings since the beginning. Its construct was simple, curved, and smooth. It was like the most flawless artwork of the heavens, yet what shocked him the most was that he was actually unable to see through the talisman markings produced by this pair of wings!</span></p>

Secondly, they were too complicated like stars that covered the sky appearing in one place and constructing a universe there.</span></p>

According to legend, it was the primeval Divine Beast Azure Phoenix that comprehended this supreme Divine Ability from its own bone markings.</span></p>

However, right when the magic treasure just appeared, it was instantly swept through fiercely by a strand of fluctuation, and it directly shattered into a pile of scrap metal, whereas the essence of Earth within it was completely obliterated.</span></p>

It was too overbearing, and this fluctuation that suppressed the world and annihilated the five elements was truly too terrifying.</span></p>

Merely this ability to counter the essence of the five elements was sufficient for it to be called world shocking.</span></p>

Yet it just so happened that the Wings of Disruption innately countered the essence of the five elements, and such a heaven defying effect was absolutely capable of shocking other cultivators.</span></p>

It couldn’t be helped, the refinement of the Talisman Armament was fairly difficult, and its might was currently on par with a Quasi Immortal Artifact. If it were to be damaged, then it would truly be too much of a heartache for him.</span></p>

After all, I’ve only cultivated the Wings of Disruption to the first level, and rashly fusing it would probably cause many drawbacks to appear…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sat cross-legged within his abode while organizing the cultivation techniques of the Wings of Disruption and Starsky Wings once more, and he noticed that he was indeed incapable of fusing these two Divine Abilities with his current strength.</span></p>

All of them were naturally at the Nether Transformation Realm and were Seed Disciples with extremely formidable auras.
