The corners of his mouth were slightly curled upwards, and the innate arrogant and overbearing bearing he possessed caused him to be extremely unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was precisely Bai Gan from the Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All those years ago in the Darchu Dynasty, the Starnet Palace that was one of the eight great powers of the southern territory’s Dragon Lake City had seized Bai Wanqing’s daughter, Xixi, and completely offended Bai Wanqing. In the end, it caused their entire sect to be annihilated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people that made a move that day was an Earthly Immortal Realm expert called Bai Teng, and the other person was Bai Gan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi still remembered that the Starnet Palace had activated the Nine-Palace Balefulstar Immortal Slaughtering Formation at that time with the intention of annihilating Bai Wanqing, Bai Teng, and Bai Gan. But, in the end, Bai Teng had taken out an Immortal Artifact and completely turned the situation around, causing the entire Starnet Palace to be annihilated, and his might was unparalleled and formidable to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That day was the first time Chen Xi had seen an Earthly Immortal Realm expert make a move and the first time he’d truly seen an Immortal Artifact, causing it to leave an extremely deep impression in his mind. So how could he possibly forget this crimson haired young man that had accompanied by Bai Teng’s side that day?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, so many years had passed, and he’d transformed from the Violet Palace Realm greenhorn youth into to the current perfection-stage Rebirth Realm Elite Disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect. At this moment, when he saw a familiar face like Bai Gan once more, he was slightly absent-minded in his heart, and it seemed as if those incidents had occurred just yesterday and were vivid within his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, he’d a disciple of the Violet Thistle Mountain’s Bai Clan. He just arrived at West Radiance Peak yesterday and said he’s an old friend of yours and has something to discuss with you.” Mu Kui explained via voice transmission from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I know.” Chen Xi replied as a wisp of a light smile appeared on the corners of his mouth, and then he said to the distant Bai Gan, “Brother Bai, long time no see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Molei and the others heaved sighs of relief in their hearts when they saw Chen Xi recognized this young man, and they left with Qing Yu. They knew that since this person had come with the intention of discussion something with Chen Xi, it would be slightly unsuitable for them to continue staying here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Truthfully speaking, I completely never imagined that a disciple of the Darchu Dynasty like you would actually smoothly become eminent in the Primeval Battlefield and join the Nine Radiance Sword Sect to become an Elite Disciple.” After everyone left, Bai Gan sized Chen Xi up briefly with his gaze and said with slight surprise, “I remember that when I saw you for the first time all those years ago, you were still at the Violet Palace Realm, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded. “Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder Little Aunt looks so highly upon you. &nbsp;Just how many years have passed now, yet you’ve already advanced to the perfection-stage of the Rebirth Realm, and it’s even to the extent that you’re only a step away from developing a Blackhole and attaining the Nether Transformation Realm. Such natural talent is extremely rare,” said Bai Gan before his expression turned serious. “I came here this time because I was entrusted by Little Aunt to bring you something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, a jade slip appeared in Bai Gan’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and a wisp of excitement couldn’t help but suffuse his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Little Aunt Bai Gan spoke of was naturally Bai Wanqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of Bai Wanqing that he’d traversed all the way through into the Primeval Battlefield without fear of difficulties and arrived in the Dark Reverie. It was all for the sake of meeting Bai Wanqing and obtaining some clues related to his parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His parents had become an obsession in his heart since a long time ago. The trials, hardships, and the countless battles he’d experiences to arrive here today was all for the sake of searching for the whereabouts of his parents!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t just his obsession, it was also the obsession of his younger brother, and it was even the obsession that his grandfather was unable to let go before passing away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But if you want to obtain this jade slip, it will depend on if you possess the strength.” Bai Gan suddenly spoke, and as he spoke, his eyes already carried a trace of surging battle intent. “Come, this jade slip is yours so long as your strength can satisfy me. If you fail, then you’re unworthy of knowing the contents of this jade slip, and you should just stay obediently in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect while trying your best to cultivate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a type of test?” Chen Xi frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly.” Bai Gan nodded. “Do you know how much Little Aunt was pushed away and reproached after she returned to the clan because of you? Everything she did was for your sake! If you don’t even possess this little bit of strength, then what qualifications do you have to obtain this jade slip?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice contained a trace of rage that couldn’t be restrained, and he seemed to feel pained from the situation Bai Wanqing faced now and felt it was unfair and not worth it…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was able to perceive this, so he didn’t hesitate and said, “Alright, I accept!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the vital energy in Chen Xi’s entire body surged like the tide as an unprecedented battle intent surged like blazing lava throughout his body, and it stimulated him to the point his mind was concentrated to an unparalleled level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he yearned for a battle, and he would go all out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good!” Bai Gan’s eyes lit up when he saw Chen Xi’s battle intent was so tremendous, and he roared with laughter. “I’ve already attained the Nether Transformation Realm now, but I’ll exert a strength at the perfection-stage of the Rebirth Realm while fighting you. So long as you’re able to resist a hundred moves of mine, not only will I give the jade slip to you, I’ll surely welcome you with open arms when you come to the Bai Clan in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, his battle intent rumbled as his crimson red hair fluttered like flames, and he possessed an overbearing imposing aura of supremacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, both of them soared up into the sky at practically the exact same time because both of them knew that once they fought, it would surely affect the West Radiance Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come! Let me see exactly how great your ability is!” Bai Gan shouted loudly as he charged over swiftly with a ferocious and overbearing aura, and then he raised his fist and smashed out. His fist carried an overbearing aura and rumbled with Dao Insight as it swept over towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strike was truly too violent, it crushed the space, broke apart the layer of clouds, and was simply impossible to resist. Even a Nether Transformation Realm expert wouldn’t dare bear the brunt of its force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Bai Gan is worthy of being a disciple of the Bai Clan. This is still when he has held back and is exerting a strength at the perfection-stage of the Rebirth Realm. If he completely erupts with his strength, exactly how formidable would his might be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He utilized the profundities within the Allheaven Truth, and it was simple and direct, unsophisticated yet grand. A single palm strike was like a myriad of tidal waves surging out, and the layer upon layer of energy overlapped together, causing its might to rise steadily and explosively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fist and palm collided together and erupted with a terrifying radiance and wave of air, causing the entire sky to seem as if an earthquake had occurred there, and it shook violently while terrifying lights charged out in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figures separated as both of them took three steps back in midair, and every single step they took caused an expanse of cracks and waves to stretch out in the sky.</span></p>

He gripped his hand to form a fist and erupted with blazing violet light before he smashed his fist down in an extremely overbearing and cold manner.</span></p>
