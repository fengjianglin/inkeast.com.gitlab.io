Various poisonous bugs and repulsive birds lived within it while consuming the various living creatures that fell into the swamp, causing it to be an extremely brutal and ferocious place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, all these poisonous bugs and repulsive birds lay prone on the ground while feeling terror and unease in their hearts as they bowed in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the depths of the swamp, the mud was tainted red by blood. Chen Xi’s tall figure stood proudly while adorned with clothes that were in rags and tainted with blood, yet his entire body emitted strands of auspicious rays of light that were peaceful and sacred, and these rays of light were nurturing his body while repairing his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, boundless potential was rising exuberantly within his body and spread throughout his body through the Rebirth Wheel that was dazzling like the sun, causing a sort of transformation to occur within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being able to come to this point was truly difficult. He’d experienced countless intense and desperate battles during these past few days, causing his body to become tattered and almost split apart, and even the vital energy within his body had dried up, so he could already be considered to have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that it could be said that he’d experience a true death, a death that completely emptied out all the vitality and energy within his body. Losing strength to attain the tribulation and overcoming adversity to eliminate the tribulation. It was equivalent to completely beginning from the start; this was true rebirth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From living to dying, from death to new life. How could an ordinary person be able to endure the danger and adversity of this process?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A path of overcoming the tribulation like this was extremely rare and the most difficult, and most of the cultivators in the world would absolutely not try it lightly. Even if one possessed shocking natural talent, it was possible that one would perish at the end of the path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This past half a month of time was torture before rebirth to Chen Xi, he’d held an eternally persistent heart amidst frustration, anguish, and hardships, and he’d suffered tortures akin to purgatory. Now, he was radiating new life and had finally succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, he could only be considered to have succeeded partially, because…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi raised his head to look towards the sky. Tribulation lightning covered a vast expanse above him while emitting a boundless aura of destruction. It was the tribulation lightning of Rebirth, and only by overcoming it would his soul transform into a Soul Core and be considered to have truly advanced into the Rebirth Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he’d come to a complete understanding now about why his tribulation lightning would develop into a world of lightning and seem so terrifying. The reason was extremely simple, his body refinement and qi refinement cultivation were both about to break through and advance at this moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was common knowledge that qi refinement and body refinement were two different schools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a qi refiner advanced into the Rebirth Realm, a Rebirth Wheel would be condensed within the Dantian and used to nurture the Soul Core. So long as the Soul Core remained, then once one’s body was destroyed, one could seize the body of another to attain new life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, once a body refiner advanced to the Rebirth Realm, the body would advance and transform into a Rebirth Goldbody, and the body would be used to nurture the Soul Core. So long as the Soul Core remained, the body would forever be unable to be destroyed. Because at that time, the body refiner would be able to reconstruct a complete body with a single thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Comparatively speaking, it was still body refiners that were slightly more formidable. Because after qi refiners seized the body of another, there was a comparatively high level of danger associated with it, whereas body refiners had utterly no need of worrying about any danger arising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this that the tribulation lightning of qi refinement and body refinement cultivators when they advanced to the Rebirth Realm was different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the tribulation lightning Chen Xi had drawn over were a mix of his body refinement and qi refinement cultivation, and its might was absolutely not as simple as one plus one. The terrifying energy of the tribulation lightning formed before his eyes had sufficiently proved this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Wheel that was like a sun within his Dantian stopped moving. After it had truly condensed into form, it was like a full moon that represented perfection, and it emitted a hazy crimson glow as it soared through the sky like the sun and illuminated the Dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s Rebirth Wheel seemed to be extremely formidable, it was vast, magnificent, and emitted a lofty and tremendous aura. True Essence flowed and surged like waterfalls within it, and its quality had already transformed, causing it to emit a trace of an eternal aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the Shaman Energy within his body surged and whistled as the nine Shaman Markings on his back enhanced the radiance of each other while emitting a brilliant sheen, and it nurtured every inch of his skin, flesh, bones, tendons, and internal organs, causing his vital energy and blood to become even more exuberant and every single drop of blood seemed to be filled with vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Rebirth Goldbody, a body that was inviolable to flames and water, impenetrable to blades and spears, and completely untainted. So long as the Soul Core remained, the body was eternal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mass of poisonous bugs and repulsive birds were even more terrified as they lay flat on the ground while trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hazy mist enshrouded the surroundings, causing this swamp to seem extremely mysterious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s body effused boundless vitality that was the essence of his vitality after achieving rebirth. Because of the appearance of the essence of vitality, the deathly air in his swamp was dispersed, causing the stench to be cleared away, and only exuberant vitality that was filled with hope and gave others the feeling of rebirth remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that all the plants in the swamp were growing ceaselessly as if all the dried up vitality here had experienced the process of rebirth just like Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Rebirth Wheel and Rebirth Goldbody are completed. Next is to experience the tribulation lightning and condense my Soul Core…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stared fixedly at the dark tribulation clouds in the sky as he muttered, and he seemed to be waiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, vitality filled his body like a surging sea, and it was strong to the point it caused the poisonous bugs and repulsive birds to tremble ceaselessly on the ground, and it was countless times more formidable than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So long as he overcame the tribulation lightning in the sky above him, he would be able to stand in the Rebirth Realm, look down on most geniuses, and deter all before him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the tribulation lightning he was overcoming was both the Rebirth Tribulations, and it was even the tribulations of both the paths of body refinement and qi refinement! This sort of method of overcoming the tribulation was bound to make him different from others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, up until this moment, the tribulation lightning still hadn’t descended and was still accumulating strength. Crimson red bolts of lightning flickered and formed into various weapons, palaces, mountains, rivers, and pagodas, causing it to seem like a world of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that human shaped lightning could vaguely be noticed to be condensing in the deepest depths of the tribulation lightning, and even though they seemed blurry, the might they emitted was terrifying to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this was unable to affect Chen Xi. He chose one of the tall mountains that stood towering in the swamp to sit cross-legged on before waiting silently with a calm expression and eyes that were bright, deep, calm, and tranquil, and his entire body was filled with spirit and energy while the divine lights and auspicious qi around his body had been restrained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at the sky while carrying an aura that seemed as if he’d returned to simplicity and nature.</span></p>
