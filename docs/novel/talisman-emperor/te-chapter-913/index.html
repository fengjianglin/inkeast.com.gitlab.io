She was pretty and cute, and she said in a low voice when she heard Qing Xiuyi, “Martial Ancestor Qing, Supreme Martial Aunt entrusted me to tell you that the day you become Dao Companions with Lord Bing Shitian is in another 67 years six months and 12 days. Supreme Martial Aunt hopes that you’ll cultivate in meditation within the sect during this period of time and don’t worry about everything that’s happening in the outside world.”</span></p>

At the same time, she was Qing Xiuyi’s master before Qing Xiuyi had reincarnated for 100 lifetimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi went silent for a short moment before she said, “I understand.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even then, Xiao Huan’s heart was filled with reverence and admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Congratulations Senior Sister. You’ve overcome all the karma of your previous lives and successfully cultivated 100 reincarnations. When you ascend to the Immortal Dimension in the future, you’ll surely establish eternal radiance!” Right at this moment, a clear and melodious howl sounded out from beneath North Star Peak, and along with this voice, a handsome figure moved through space and drifted over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wore a star shaped crown, had eyes that were brilliant like stars, a handsome appearance, and as he looked around, he emanated a dignified and bold aura that subdued the hearts of all. It was exactly Bing Shitian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he gazed at that familiar beautiful figure that stood at the bank of the ocean of violet bamboo and before a precipice, a wisp of burning adoration suddenly suffused the depths of Bing Shitian’s eyes, yet it vanished in a flash, causing him to recover his usual composed and graceful bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi acted as if she didn’t hear this instead, and she just silently looked towards the distance. The sea of clouds was roiling over there, causing thousands of waves to arise, and under the illumination of sunlight, it was suffused with a gorgeous luster that seemed like golden flakes and was extremely magnificent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian didn’t have the slightest awareness of being disregarded, and he grinned lightly before walking forward and standing side by side with Qing Xiuyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Xiao Huan’s angle, both of them were simply like a divine couple. Both of them were so perfect, perfect to the point others were unable to arouse the slightest feeling of envy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, why is Martial Ancestor Qing so cold towards Lord Bing Shitian? Countless people are willing to spend their entire lifetimes with a renowned and peerless genius from the Immortal Dimension like him, right? Could it be that it’s because of Chen Xi?” Xian Huan frowned, and she thought with slight contempt. “He’s just a tiny insect that made its way out from a small world. He has no status, no cultivation, and he isn’t even equal to a ten thousandth of Lord Bing Shitian. Why would Martial Ancestor Qing have a child for him? This is surely a lie, it’s surely a lie that little insect made up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a disciple that served by Qing Xiuyi’s side, Xiao Huan was extremely proud as well. Not to mention an ordinary person, even the outstanding disciples of the Heavenflow Dao Sect’s younger generation weren’t taken seriously by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In her eyes, only great figures like Bing Shitian were worth of reverence. Of course, she knew very well that nothing would even happen between herself and Bing Shitian, but it didn’t stop her from admiring and worshipping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Huan, leave for now. I have some things I want to talk with Xiuyi about.” Bing Shitian turned around and smiled warmly to Xiao Huan as he gestured with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Huan instantly returned to her senses from her thoughts, and she smiled sweetly before bowing and leaving. However, she was still thinking in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lord Bing Shitian is warm, modest, and kind to others. He doesn’t have the slightest haughty air…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, she never thought whether Bing Shitian would spare a glance at her if she wasn’t the disciple that served by Qing Xiuyi’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi couldn’t help but frown when she heard the words ‘Xiuyi,’ and then her expression returned to normal before she said indifferently, “Don’t address me in that way in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian laughed lightheartedly and said, “Senior Sister, you’re still the same as before and don’t like others being too intimate with you. But we’re going to become Dao Companions very soon. It’s only a method of address, so there’s no need to be too persistent.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi puckered her lips and kept silent, yet her brows knit together imperceptibly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cherry lips were moist, her skin tender, and her jet black and beautiful hair swayed gently with the mountain wind, causing her to be incomparably graceful and reveal indescribable beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian was slightly dazed from this sight, and his heart couldn’t help but burn as he said, “Senior Sister, I’ll bring you to the Immortal Dimension after we’ve become Dao Companions. That’s the world that belongs to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi suddenly turned around, and then her jade white hand flipped before it struck an extremely resounding slap on Bing Shitian’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sudden scene shocked Bing Shitian to the point he forgot to dodge, and he opened his eyes wide while staring fixedly at Qing Xiuyi before he said with a deep voice, “Why!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi turned away once more and only left the side of her face to Bing Shitian as she said indifferently, “You knocked me out all those years ago in the Primeval Battlefield and forcefully brought me here. This slap is your punishment. Feel free to come fight me if you’re unsatisfied.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian was stunned, and then he actually started laughing and wasn’t angry in the slightest. It was even to the extent he started roaring with laughter in the end and stared at Qing Xiuyi with a burning gaze. “This is the Senior Sister Qing that I know well. I accept this slap completely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi sighed and said, “Leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smile on Bing Shitian’s face was gradually restrained before an imperceptible trace of gloominess flashed between his brows, and then he said, “Senior Sister, you’ve already punished me, so why are you still so cold towards me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Xiuyi remained silent like a mountain of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian took a deep breath when he saw this, and then he said, “I’ve always been unable to discern which part of me can’t compare to a tiny ant from a remote village like the Darchu Dynasty. In terms of identity, I’m an emissary of the Immortal Dimension that’s under the authority of Immortal Monarch Huang Long and possess peerless glory. In terms of cultivation, I’ve already attained the Golden Immortal Realm, and even if I leave the Heavenflow Dao Sect, it’s sufficient for me to rule over an area of the Immortal Dimension. In terms of talent…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could finish speaking, Qing Xiuyi had directly interrupted him. “All of this is meaningless.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m tired.” Qing Xiuyi turned around and left by herself. From the beginning until the end, she didn’t say another word.</span></p>

So long as we become Dao Companions, then he’ll cripple his own cultivation and be obliterated for eternity! On the other hand, even you know that our relationship as Dao Companions was destined a long time ago and can’t be changed!”</span></p>

So no matter if you’re willing or not, I’ll surely become Dao Companions with you when the agreed upon time arrives!”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Beiyu laughed bitterly. All those years ago, he was a Core Disciple of the Heavenflow Dao Sect just like Bing Shitian and Qing Xiuyi. But after a few thousands of years had passed, Bing Shitian had become a great figure of the Immortal Dimension and Qing Xiuyi had been reborn through 100 cycles of reincarnations, whereas he had succeeded the position of Sect Master. Everything was so different now.</span></p>

Moreover, this agreement even received the approval and acknowledgement of numerous seniors of the sect. In my opinion, you only have to wait silently, and when the day comes, the entire Heavenflow Dao Sect will naturally hold a great banquet to celebrate for you and Senior Sister Qing.”</span></p>

Invite all the seniors of the various sects of the world and prestigious figures to gather at my Heavenflow Dao Sect. Right, besides the 10 great immortal sects, send invitations to those Unknown Lands and Secluded Paradises in my name. Let me see who dares to not come!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing Shitian interrupted Lu Beiyu with a wave of his hand. “It isn’t, it isn’t early in the slightest. I want to allow Chen Xi to find out about this and cause him to be unable to eat or rest at ease in these few tens of years to come!”&nbsp;</span></p>

Xiuyi is too persistent, and she’ll only obey Martial Aunt True Jade’s words. No matter if she hates me or not after the matter, I don’t care anymore because so long as I’m able to obtain her, then she’ll understand my intentions one day!”</span></p>

Even if Xiuyi is given a thousand years or ten thousand years, so long as she has set her mind to something, then it won’t change. This is her character, and I understand her better than you.”</span></p>
