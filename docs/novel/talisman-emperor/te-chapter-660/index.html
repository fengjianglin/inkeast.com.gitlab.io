 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was extremely shocking. It was like a great devil had descended into the world as jet black clouds roiled and emitted a boundless devilish glow, and the pressure and vast aura it emitted was truly horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being obstructed by this caused all of Chen Xi’s attacks to strike onto this hand, and it was like two volcanos that had collided with each other. The collision emitted rumbling that shook the heavens and the earth while emitting a myriad of rays of divine light, and the aftershock swept out towards the surroundings, causing space to be torn apart and rocks to be shattered. Everyone in the surroundings dodged repeatedly while they revealed extremely astonished expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha! Amazing! I never imagined that the Nine Radiance Sword Sect actually possessed a figure like you, Chen Xi. You’re indeed a rare top figure, and I’ll have a good spar with you when we meet next!” A wave of loud laughter sounded out like the roar of a dragon, and it shook the surroundings while emitting a peerlessly arrogant and overbearing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, everyone noticed a tall and dignified figure flashing out while carrying a shocking jet black light, and the figure tore through the sky before swiftly vanishing without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nether Spring Devil Sect’s Qiu Jun!<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never imagined that it would actually be him who made a move. He really does deserve to be the sacred disciple of the devil sect that possesses the Thousand Severance Devilbody. Merely a single strike of his revealed such a boundlessly elegant demeanor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiu Jun? Could it be that it was he who instructed the assassin, Shroud, to assassinate Chen Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone recognized Qiu Jun and were extremely shocked in their hearts because this was a formidable figure of the devil sect that was like the sun in the midday sky, and he’d actually made an appearance here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, at this moment, the clouds of smoke in the sky had dispersed, and Chen Xi’s tall figure had once again appeared within everyone’s fields of vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it turns out that the assassin and this fellow are actually together. But, why would they want to go against me? It’s absolutely impossible for it to be for the sake of the Grand Dao Fragments. After all, Shroud had already tried to assassinate me once before I arrived at the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, and at that time, I hadn’t obtained a single Grand Dao Fragment yet…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi frowned as he looked towards the direction Qiu Jun vanished, and he knew that even if he pursued now, he would probably be unable to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You want to flee as well?” Chen Xi turned around abruptly to gaze towards Feng Jianbai who was at the side. This fellow intended to seize this opportunity to flee, and when Chen Xi saw this, he directly slashed out with his sword, causing a rain of blood to spray out as he completely ended Feng Jianbai’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Chen Xi swept the surroundings with his gaze, and there was actually not a single person amongst the few hundred experts of the various powers that dared look him in the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, the will of these experts had already been awed by his might, and they didn’t dare make any rash movements for now at least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, Chen Xi’s gaze descended onto the area before the enormous mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that place, Long Zhenbei and An Wei were trapped by the Eight Illusion Immortal Cage. On a rock at the side from them was a figure that sat cross-legged atop it, his back was ramrod straight, his shoulders wide, and he remained there without moving like a mountain. He seemed as if he’d fused with the heavens and the earth, and his aura was unique and formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure suddenly opened its eyes upon noticing Chen Xi’s gaze, and it erupted with strands of blazing glows of fire that interweaved together and formed numerous strange phenomena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan Shisan?” Chen Xi’s eyes focused as he discerned the uniqueness of this person’s physique. It seemed as if it was constructed from fiery jade, causing him to be like a god that innately controlled the element of fire and was extremely oppressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Firestar Body, a phenomenon that was inborn. According to rumor, since the moment of birth, a person that possessed this physique would have grasped the Grand Dao of Fire and possess an extremely intimate connection with the myriad of flames in the heavens and the earth. When cultivated to the limit, the possessor of the physique was even capable of communicating with the energy of fire within nature itself to be of use to himself, and it was peerlessly formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, one that possessed such a physique was surely that genius from the Heavenflow Dao Sect who was similarly the most renowned madman in the 10 great immortal sects that yearned madly for battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time.” Yan Shisan stood up. He was tall and handsome, and every single move he made was filled with an arrogant and overbearing aura that drew the attention of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people were capable of making others have a deep impression of them with a single glance, and it caused others to feel they were extraordinary and would soar into the sky sooner or later. Obviously, Yan Shisan was such a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your strength from before was already sufficient to be a match for me. Now, so long as you’re able to defeat me, you can freely take these two people away. Otherwise, leave your life behind!” He raised his hand to point towards An Wei and Long Zhenbei who were trapped within the Eight Illusion Immortal Cage as he spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he gave his body a long stretch. Instantly, he seemed to have become a different person. His long hair fluttered about while his flaming eyes seemed like bolts of fiery lightning, and his thin and imposing physique surged with monstrous battle intent. He was like a blazing sun that was willful, arrogant, and peerlessly overbearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the true Yan Shisan, one that was mad for battle. Besides battle, there wasn’t anything in the world that was capable of drawing his intention. Especially when he encountered an opponent that moved him, he would seem as if he’d obtained a supreme treasure in the world, and his entire bearing would become completely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He really is formidable. I heard this madman, Yan Shisan, had already grasped the ability to multiply his combat strength by six times a long time ago, and he possesses precious treasures. He’s absolutely a top existence amongst his peers in the Heavenflow Dao Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. But, the most important is his combat experience that’s abundant to the extreme because he has experienced countless horrifying battles to attain his current accomplishments.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi can be proud of himself for being able to be chosen as an opponent by this world-renowned madman. After all, an ordinary person would be utterly incapable of entering Yan Shisan’s eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone exclaimed with admiration. The reason they hadn’t left for so long was because they had placed hope on Yan Shisan, and they felt his strength was sufficient to turn around the situation and annihilate Chen Xi.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this were to happen, then they could seize the opportunity to have a share, so why not?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Long Zhenbei and An Wei couldn’t help but frown as a wisp of worry gushed onto their faces. This madman Yan Shisan was too formidable and was able to casually take out eight Quasi Immortal Artifact grade flags to form the Eight Illusion Immortal Cage that trapped both of them. It wasn’t difficult to imagine that Yan Shisan had utterly no lack of formidable treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was practically impossible to find a match amongst those of the same cultivation for such a figure that yearned madly for battle and possessed precious treasures, and once Chen Xi was to go against him, it was impossible to determine the outcome!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Chen Xi had already been fighting with the crowd of geniuses for a long time earlier, whereas Yan Shisan had been building up his strength since the beginning. When the two of them were compared, Chen Xi would probably be inferior just in terms of their current states.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they thought like this, their hearts grew heavier, and they became even more worried for Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You took my companions hostage just for the sake of fighting me?” Chen Xi’s expression was calm while his imposing aura was like a bottomless abyss, and his eyes flickered with profound talisman markings as he stared at Yan Shisan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Yan Shisan challenged him to battle fairly, then perhaps he would respect Yan Shisan slightly. But unfortunately, Yan Shisan had used the lives of An Wei and Long Zhenbei to threaten him, and this caused him to detest Yan Shisan.</span></p>

An expanse of a bloody sea surged out while roiling with talisman markings of slaughter, and it was like a vast and mighty tempestuous storm that dyed the sky blood red.</span></p>

Chen Xi used actions to tell Yan Shisan that he similarly desired to annihilate Yan Shisan, and he even wasn’t willing to speak further.</span></p>

Expanses of fiery glows shot out, and it pierced the eyes of everyone to the point it ached while he stretched out his hand and pushed forward.</span></p>

It was an entire 500km in size, completely crystalline, white, and soft like jade. Moreover, a kingdom of flames actually seemed to have been formed within the palm, and countless living beings were living within the kingdom, causing it to be extremely mysterious and horrifying.</span></p>

This was a peak-grade Dao Art that only apex experts were capable of executing. Its requirements towards one’s cultivation was extremely harsh, and it was one of the ultimate inheritances of the Heavenflow Dao Sect.</span></p>

They pressed down before slowly closing together with the intention of completely confining Chen Xi.</span></p>
