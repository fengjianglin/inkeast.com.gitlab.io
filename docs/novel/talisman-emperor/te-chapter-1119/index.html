 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven ancient clans, four Immortal kings, and even the forces of the Immortal Court were unable to represent the three dimensions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the Mortal Dimension, Netherworld, Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, and various other mysterious domains resided in the three dimensions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, there were three supreme and mysterious sects in the three dimensions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only a small portion of the myriad of living beings in the countless worlds of the three dimensions were able to possess knowledge about these three mysterious and supreme sects, and those that were able to know the names of these sects were even fewer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if it was a top power in the Immortal Dimension, the existence of these three sects was like a taboo, so they wouldn’t speak of it even if they knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a vague understanding that Chen Xi might be an heir of Oracle Mountain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a possibility and not a fact because even he was unable to obtain a definite answer from Liang Bing or Liang Tianheng. At the bottom of it all, it was because of the word ‘taboo.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Liang Ren was similarly aware that only a handful of people in the Immortal Dimension were able to faintly guess Chen Xi’s identity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because if everyone knew that he was from Oracle Mountain, then how could the Yin Clan dare to harm him like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Yin Clan was related to Oracle Mountain, yet under such circumstances, the Yin Clan was still unable to infer Chen Xi’s importance, and it was a wonder if Old Dog Yin was feigning ignorance or he was really unaware…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the more it was like this, the more curious Liang Ren became because since Chen Xi possessed such an identity, then why did Chen Xi constantly keep it a secret?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why did he keep it a secret?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was naturally clearly aware about all of this, yet even if he disregarded the taboos of his inheritance, the most important factor was that he wanted to deal with his own affairs. This was something Ji Yu told him that he must do, and it was something that his Senior Sister Li Yang had always insisted upon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because it was a part of their expectations towards Chen Xi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wanted to become a true expert, walk to the peak of the Grand Dao, gain a foothold in the Immortal Dimension, look down upon the world… If he only relied on external sources of strength, then he would be unable to achieve great success in the end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this was something that Chen Xi had thought about clearly while still at Darchu Dynasty. Yes, he intended to rely on his own strength to complete the heavy responsibilities on his shoulder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were his own affairs, and only by accomplishing them himself would the rage and conflict that had accumulated in his heart for countless years be truly released!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Chen Xi didn’t bring up this matter again, and Liang Ren naturally wouldn’t try to get to the bottom of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their gazes descended once more onto the light green colored piece of silk that recorded the top thousand experts on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi noticed that Jiang Zhuliu’s ranking had actually ascended to the 301</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">st</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings, and it was extremely striking. Next, it was Gu Yueming, and he was ranked at the 392</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">nd</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao was after Gu Yueming, and she was ranked at the 546</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position. However, according to Liang Ren, Yin Miaomiao had advanced once more last month, and she’d entered into the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Thus, her final ranking on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings would only be higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Liang Ren’s position seemed to be rather low, and he was ranked at the 863</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">rd</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position. This position seemed to be extremely safe, yet the top experts of various places like the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, and Phoenix Clan would be participating in the test, and they would definitely seize some positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, it created a great threat to Liang Ren’s position instead, and it was even to the extent that he might be pushed out of the rankings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chen Xi himself, he wasn’t really worried. Even though he was currently ranked at the 999</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position, yet he’d already advanced into the Mysterious Immortal Realm and even killed twelve Void Guards on his way from Southbridge Continent to Valiant Star Continent. The Void Guards were Sacrificial Soldiers of the Zuoqiu Clan, and the weakest amongst them was already capable of being ranked in the top five hundred positions of the Ascensio Immortal Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, how could Chen Xi be worried about being eliminated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren seemed to be aware as well that his ranking was slightly dangerous, and he pondered deeply before he said, “According to the information I obtained, amongst the top figures of the younger generation that came from outside the Immortal Dimension, almost thirty experts have come from the Buddha Dimension, whereas the Dragon Dimension and Phoenix Dimension have each brought over twenty plus experts. Coupled with the young experts of the mysterious domains, they form a total of more than two hundred experts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi frowned as he said, “In this way, experts ranked below the top eight hundred positions on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings might be eliminated?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren said in a low voice, “Indeed. Even though the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, Phoenix Dimension, and other such domains aren’t as formidable as the Immortal Dimension, yet they’re still top worlds in the three dimensions. Even though only a few of them have come, yet they’re actually the elites amongst the elites. Moreover, since they dared to come, then they are surely sufficiently certain in their ability to enter Dao Emperor Academy. Otherwise, it would be too embarrassing if they were eliminated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, he suddenly smiled mysteriously and looked at Chen Xi as he said, “However, it isn’t so easy to eliminate me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he came to a sudden understanding that Liang Ren had probably concealed some ability, allowing Liang Ren to have the confidence to speak such words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, Liang Ren gave him the answer in the next moment, and he said slowly, “Since I lost to Yin Miaomiao that day, I’ve already encountered the critical factor to advance. However, I’ve been restraining myself all along and didn’t chose to break through. But now it would seem like it’s time to choose to advance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi teased. “Could it be that you intended to act weak to defeat the strong in the test since the beginning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren chuckled, and then he sighed. “It can’t be helped. I lost face from being defeated by Yin Miaomiao that day, so I have to regain this face during Dao Emperor Academy’s test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke up to here, he patted Chen Xi on the shoulder and said, “I’m relieved that you’ve arrived safely today. There are seven days before the test begins, so I’m going to enter into closed door cultivation during this period of time and break through to the advanced-stage of the Mysterious Immortal Realm. Looks for Senior Tie Qiuyu if you have any questions. Even though he’s greedy, he isn’t a bad person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi smiled and said, “Alright, go on ahead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Liang Ren left, Chen Xi returned to his room as well, and then he rested briefly before he started to meditate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t enter the world of stars. After all, only another seven days remained before Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test began. As the guide of Southbridge Continent’s Martial Soul Hall, Tie Qiuyu would definitely have many things to instruct them on during this period of time. If he were to enter into closed door cultivation within the world of stars, then he would probably miss many things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, within Midnight Continent’s Martial Soul Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike the Martial Soul Halls of the other continents, as one of the four great continents, the space within the Midnight Continent’s Martial Soul Hall overlapped in layers and were separated into numerous small scale paradises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this was prepared for the disciples of Midnight Continent that were participating in Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within one of the paradises, courtyards stood like trees in a forest. There were artificial mountains, flowing streams, and luxuriant flowers and plants. The environment was rather quiet and beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Linglong sat before a stone table while supporting her chin up with her hand. She looked at the pretty young woman in a plain dress and feathered crown with a dazed gaze. There seemed to be something weighing down upon her mind, and she seemed slightly preoccupied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shockingly, the young woman was Zuoqiu Ke. She seemed to have noticed that Mu Linglong was preoccupied, yet she still chuckled lightly with a clear voice. “My Big Brother has already personally punished Immortal Monarch Lin Hao for offending you that day. If you’re still dissatisfied, then I’ll head to the Eastern Peace Continent’s Immortal Monarch’s Estate with you in the future, and we’ll wreak havoc there until you’ve vented all your anger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If anyone else were to have heard her, then that person’s jaw would surely hit the floor. But Mu Linglong didn’t think much of it because no matter how much she desired to disregard Zuoqiu Ke, she had to admit that as a direct descendant of the Zuoqiu Clan and the younger sister of one of the six blazing suns, Zuoqiu Kong, Zuoqiu Ke did indeed possess the qualifications to speak such words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Mu Linglong didn’t need it because if she so desired it, then she could accomplish it herself. How could there be any need to use the members of the Zuoqiu Clan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, then I have to thank you first.” Mu Linglong answered in a slightly perfunctory manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of anger flashed past the depths of Zuoqiu Ke’s eyes, yet she chuckled as she said, “I only came here this time to make things clear to you. Immortal Monarch Lin Hao’s actions that day were only targeted towards Chen Xi and not you. I hope you don’t take it to heart. We’ll be fellow students in Dao Emperor Academy in the future, so we should take care of each other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Linglong’s beautiful brows raised as she recalled her cousin brother’s instructions. In the end, she didn’t say anything too drastic, and she just said, “Your brother has already explained it to my cousin brother. There’s no need for you to say anything further.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Ke nodded. “Alright. There isn’t much time left before Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test begins. I have to return and prepare, so I won’t continue disturbing you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, Zuoqiu Ke had stood up, and then she smiled sweetly before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, I remember that you’re just like me, and you don’t have to participate in the test this time to enter Dao Emperor Academy. What’re you preparing? Could it be that you really intend to participate in those three rounds of tests? In that way, we’ll probably be unable to be fellow students.” Mu Linglong still couldn’t refrain herself, and she pursued with a question in a seemingly innocent manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The meaning behind her words were that Zuoqiu Ke better not think that she could be proud in front of Mu Linglong while only ranked at the 1,000</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;position on the Ascensio Immortal Rankings now. In the end, she would still have to rely on the forces of her clan to enter Dao Emperor Academy because if she were to participate in the test, then she would be eliminated in the first round!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Ke’s figure stiffened as she discerned the meaning behind Mu Linglong’s words, and she felt even more infuriated in her heart. She didn’t speak any further and left hastily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a direct descendant of the Zuoqiu Clan and the youngest daughter of the current patriarch, she was like a little princess, and her status wasn’t inferior to Mu Linglong in the slightest. If it wasn’t for her keeping in mind her older brother’s instructions, she would have turned hostile against Mu Linglong upon hearing such ridiculing words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hmph! This little girl is truly arrogant and conceited. I’ve already given her enough face by coming to pay her a visit, yet she took a yard instead. If it wasn’t out of the consideration that we’re both disciples of ancient clans, I would surely have taught her a good lesson today!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zuoqiu Ke walked out of Midnight Continent’s Martial Soul Hall, her pretty oval shaped face was instantly covered in a layer of gloominess while her gaze turned piercingly cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Miss, I’ve already sent the invitation for the Yin Clan’s Yin Miaomiao to meet you tonight. Besides that, Chen Xi entered Southbridge Continent’s Martial Soul Hall thirty minutes ago.” A dark skinned young man with a capable bearing seemed to have been waiting outside the Martial Soul Hall since a long time ago, and he immediately moved forward and sent a voice transmission in a low voice upon noticing Zuoqiu Ke walking out of the hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
