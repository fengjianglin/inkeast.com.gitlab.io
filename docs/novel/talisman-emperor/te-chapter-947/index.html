 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous figures charged into the sky and entered into fierce combat. Thunder raged while divine lights surged, and it transformed an area of 5,000km in the vicinity into a horrifying battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a battle that pertained to Earthly Immortal Realm experts. Mountains and rivers collapsed while the sun and moon were cast beneath a shadow with a flick of the finger, and their might shocked the people in the city to the point of fleeing for their lives as they were deeply afraid of being affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, exclamations of shock and cries for help filled the surroundings, and it was a complete mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this chaos, Chen Xi brought Cui Qingning over to stand silently outside the battlefield, and his bearing was calm like a rock while his gaze stared fixedly at the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation was very bad!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter if it was Gu Tian or Cui Ming, both of them weren’t a match for their opponents. They were in a suppressed state as soon as they entered into fierce battle, and if it wasn’t for them fighting with their lives on the line and without fear of death, they would have probably lost a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only person that Chen Xi wasn’t worried about was Bei Ling. This woman that was formed from a strand of a Ghost Emperor’s Bodhi Heart that had attained the Dao possessed an undoubtedly formidable strength. She was cold and murderous, and she faintly occupied a slightly advantageous position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially surprising to him was that every single move Bei Ling made actually carried the aura that belonged to the Paramita Dao Insight. Even though it hadn’t attained mastery, yet its might couldn’t be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this that the Judge of Life from the Ghost Path, Rui Qing, was suppressed to the point of dodging repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Paramita Dao Insight was one of the three supreme Grand Dao Insights of the Netherworld, and it was on par with the Oblivion and Terminus Dao Insights. Originally, Chen Xi thought that no one else in the world besides him was able to comprehend its profundities now, yet obviously, this sort of understanding seemed to be slightly mistaken…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a loud shout that shocked the heavens resounded out abruptly. “Brother Chen! What’re you standing there for? Quickly take Qingning and leave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Cui Ming that was looking over at him with a furious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never had he imagined that not only had Chen Xi not left, Chen Xi was even standing and watching the battle from afar like an idiot, and this scene infuriated him to the point his lungs almost exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was fighting desperately for the sake of striving for a chance at survival as wanted to allow Chen Xi and Cui Qingning to escape safely, so how could he have imagined that he would see such a scene?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that this fellow has been scared stiff?</span></p>

He was both shocked and furious while his heart fell to rock bottom, and he felt that he’d misjudged Chen Xi this time…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, it’s only a little fellow at the Golden Core Realm, how could he be of great use?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sixth Cousin Brother, I won’t go.” Cui Qingning suddenly shouted loudly with agitation. “If you die, then I don’t want to live as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi! I’ll kill you right now if you don’t fucking get going! Fuck off! Fuck off right now!” Cui Ming roared with a savage expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, Young Master Cui, this fellow you entrusted her with is good for nothing. How could you hand over such an important matter to a piece of trash? Obediently accept your fate because none of you will be able to escape from my hands today.” Wang Chong roared with laughter while his fists were like dragons, and he bent his elbow before punching, causing it to tear through the sky while it transformed into a myriad of fist shadows that forced Cui Ming to retreat repeatedly. Wang Chong didn’t give Cui Ming any time to catch his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

He’s suffered a heavy injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Gu Tian!” Cui Qingning exclaimed with shock, and her countenance turned ghastly pale and translucent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! Leave! Could it be that you want to see all of us die?” Cui Ming’s hair was disheveled as he gritted his teeth and howled like a madman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Chen Xi finally decided to stop concealing his strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he would be misunderstood by them after the battle, he could just leave because…he’d been shocked by Cui Ming and Gu Tian’s actions of being willing to die for a cause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t allow himself to continue standing idly by!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! It’s too late. Once I deal with this impenetrable thing, a little ant at the Golden Core Realm can be killed at my whim, so where can he escape to?” Liu Jun roared with laughter while his figure flashed towards Gu Tian, and his palm was like the beak of a crane and sharp like a needle as it stabbed fiercely towards Gu Tian’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, Liu Jun was even able to clearly notice the trace of helplessness and despair that surged into Gu Tian’s eyes, and Gu Tian’s dying appearance caused the blood in his entire body to become excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Judge of Life from the Ghost Path, his hands were tainted with the blood of countless souls. Every single time he killed, it was capable of allowing him to feel excited and as if he was walking on air. It was so wonderful, so alluring…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at this critical moment, an enormous fist suddenly appeared within Liu Jun’s field of vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmm? This is…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Liu Jun could react, he felt his face had been knocked by a mountain, and his entire face sunk down and was badly mutilated. His cheekbone, forehead, and nose had all been shattered, and he was rendered dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for him having dodged in time, this punch would have almost blasted his head apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even then, Liu Jun let out an extremely miserable shrill cry, and he swiftly dodged backward as if his butt was on fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is it!? You’re courting death! How dare you launch a surprise attack! I’ll fucking kill you!” Liu Jun roared madly, and his badly mutilated face caused him to see hideous and horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene instantly caused everyone in all the fierce battles to stop successively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They raised their eyes to look, and they saw a tall figure was suddenly standing before Gu Tian. His face was handsome, his eyes profound like stars, and as he stood there casually, it seemed like his backbone was a spear that could pierce through the sky while he seemed as if he intended to compete for supremacy with the Grand Dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi!</span></p>

He was like a rooted pine tree and like a rock, and he stood there in a carefree and composed manner. When the might of Liu Jun’s fist had enveloped towards him, he stretched out his arm, grabbed, shook, and smashed.</span></p>

A bang resounded out, and Liu Jun didn’t even have the time to let out a shrill cry before his entire body shattered and transformed into a rain of blood that rained down beneath the night sky.</span></p>

But you’re biting off more than you can chew by acting in this way.” Wang Chong took a deep breath while he stared at Chen Xi with a gaze that was like a hawk, and he said slowly, “To tell you the truth, the Ghost Path, Asura Path, Hell Path, Punishment Bureau, and various other organizations are involved in this operation. Acting in this way will only cause harm to yourself, so I advise you not to get mixed up in it.”</span></p>
