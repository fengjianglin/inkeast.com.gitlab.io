 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s speed was extremely swift, swift to the point of making most spirit chefs sigh with embarrassment from their inferiority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the key was that the condition of the ingredients prepared by him were thin like cicada’s wings, fine like catkin pollen, and even the flowers carved on these ingredients seemed as if a world had been opened within the tiny space, causing it to be flawless and beautiful to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that it could already be described as perfect.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was common knowledge that no matter if it was slicing, cutting into threads, or carving flowers, all of it wasn’t just for the sake of it being pleasing to the eye, but most importantly, it was easier for the taste to enter the ingredients like this. Especially when dealing with meats that were abundant in spirit energy, carving flowers atop it allowed the spirit energy within to be more easily absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, Chen Xi had already attained a terrifying height in terms of the preparation of materials!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The preparation of materials was only the first step in cooking delicacies, and Chen Xi’s display in this step could be said to have given them a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They started to impatiently want to witness how Chen Xi cooked. For example, the combination of seasoning, the control of spirit flames, the utilization of utensils, and so on and so forth.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manager Huang and Bai Gunan gaped, and their chins almost hit the floor.</span></p>

They were able to discern from Chen Xi’s string of smooth and skillful movements that it was absolutely impossible if someone said this fellow hadn’t been a spirit chef in the past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi started cooking.</span></p>

With a swing of his hand, over 100 ingredients were divided into a few tens of batches, and they were either like silver paste that flowed on the table, immersed within stalactite milk, nurtured within a variety of spirit liquids, or directly placed within the wok.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he lit the spirit flame and controlled the utensils as he used his Divine Sense to sense the minute changes in the spirit flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In next to no time, a few types of ingredients were placed one by one into the wok by Chen Xi, and there were ingredients that were green, red, white, blue… They possessed brilliant colors that pleased the eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What dish is he cooking?” Bai Gunan couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva from just smelling the fragrance that effused out, and he couldn’t restrain himself from asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I’m not wrong, it ought to be a dish called Rainbow Spindrift. It’s a dish that only five leaf spirit chefs and above are capable of cooking because the ingredients and spirit flames utilized by it have extremely harsh requirements and an exceedingly high difficulty.” Manager Huang pondered for a moment before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, why have I not heard about it?” Bai Gunan spoke with surprise. Even though he wasn’t a spirit chef, he was a Young Master that was skilled in enjoying himself. He’s tried all kinds of precious and extraordinary delicacies, yet he just happened to have never heard of the Rainbow Spindrift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This dish is for Golden Core Realm cultivators, and it isn’t really precious amongst all the various dishes. But comparatively speaking, it’s indeed the most troublesome to cook. Merely the ingredients of varying attributes utilized by it were no less than 100 types, and the steps to cook it were over 1,000 in number. Unless a spirit chef was forced to cook it, even five leaf spirit chefs were unwilling to cook this dish. Thus, the name of the Rainbow Spindrift is naturally known to few.” Manager Huang spoke confidently as if he was talking about his own treasures, and it was obvious from this that he wasn’t the manager of this restaurant for nothing. Even though he wasn’t a chef, he possessed clear knowledge of all the processes required to cook the various dishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s one more thing you didn’t say. This Rainbow Spindrift is a dish that a qualified spirit chef would surely be capable of cooking. In the inheritance of spirit chefs, this dish is usually utilized to test the disciples one takes.” Master Yong spoke abruptly. At this moment, his expression was slightly complicated because since Chen Xi knew the steps to cook the Rainbow Spindrift, Chen Xi was absolutely someone that had once trained in the legitimate Culinary Arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was truly surprising to him because he’d similarly never imagined that a peerless genius with Chen Xi’s status would have actually taken up the profession of spirit chef in the past, and if news of this were to be spread, there would probably few that would believe it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rainbow Spindrift… What does this fellow intend to do by cooking this dish at this moment? Could it be that he wants to obtain the acknowledgement of all the spirit chefs here?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Yong was extremely bewildered in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other spirit chefs were similarly bewildered. But in next to no time, their attentions were completely drawn over by Chen Xi’s exceedingly skilled culinary arts, and they couldn’t be bothered to think about anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the entire kitchen was silent while the gazes of everyone had converged onto Chen Xi, and admiration was aroused within their hearts as they looked at his technique that dazzled the eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was said that they had doubts towards Chen Xi’s culinary skill in the beginning, then now, they’d already been gradually and completely convinced by everything Chen Xi had revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi seemed as if he hadn’t noticed all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was immersed within his own world, and he seemed as if he’d returned to his youth and returned to the days of learning the culinary arts from Old Man Ma in Clear Stream Restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time zipped by, those years ceased to exist, whereas those familiar people had disappeared without a trace. But everything he’d learned during that period of time seemed like aged wine that was sealed within his blood, and it became even richer as time went by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, no matter how rich and dense the taste of this aged wine was, there was no one to drink with him anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he could only pay his respects in this way, and utilize a Rainbow Spindrift to pay his respects to Old Man Ma, Pei Pei, and Qiao Nan who’d vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This dish was the first dish spirit chefs tested their disciples with, and he similarly wanted to use this dish to convey his affection to those acquaintances from that period of time as a way to comfort their hearts.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Under the baking of Spirit Converging Yin Flames, snow white waves that overlapped each other and roiled without end appeared above the dish that was complete in color, taste, and fragrance, and it formed into dazzling and resplendent rainbow bridges that rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, a tempting and refreshing fragrance effused out like one’s lover that had removed her veil to reveal a shocking and peerless appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked speechless while some with discerning gazes like Master Yong even discovered a trace of variation from the fragrance and spirit energy emitted from this dish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely this variation that caused him to be unable to refrain his shock.</span></p>

He was truly curious how the dish Chen Xi cooked would be.</span></p>

It’s truly god damn tasty!” He’d just taken the first bite when Bai Gunan felt a special taste instantly spread throughout his mouth, causing his tongue to tremble slightly as if it was shocked by electricity, and it was filled with a numb and smooth feeling. The taste of the dish was very unique, it was tasty, refreshing, carried an unbroken feeling of smoothness, and it was wonderful to the extreme.</span></p>
