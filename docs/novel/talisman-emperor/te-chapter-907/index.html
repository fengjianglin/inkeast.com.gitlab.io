But in next to no time, her attention was drawn by the experiences Chen Xi had while wandering through the world all those years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides some extremely private matters, Chen Xi practically didn’t conceal anything, and he spoke of everything he’d experienced all through these years. But he didn’t describe it too much and spoke in an extremely calm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Bai Wanqing listened extremely seriously and frequently exclaimed with surprise as she never imagined that Chen Xi had experienced such a windy and bumpy road throughout these years, and it was filled with such a legendary aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was in the Darchu Dynasty, he obtained the first in the Goldlake Meeting, was pursued by the Blacksun Pavilion, and then finally entered the Primeval Battlefield with the identity of number one genius in the younger generation of the Darchu Dynasty.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So all of them were so novel and abundant with the aura of legends to her.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head. “These were all things that I ought to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing smiled, and she sighed abruptly because she thought of something before pondering deeply and said, “I know that you urgently want to know the information about your parents. But before this, you must first become clearly aware of what sort of existence the Zuoqiu Clan is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and nodded. “Aunt Bai, please guide me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You probably are already aware that the Zuoqiu Clan isn’t a power from the Mortal Dimension, and it resides in the Immortal Dimension.” Bai Wanqing pondered for a moment before she said slowly, “The Immortal Dimension is extremely huge, to the point it exceeds your imagination, and it’s practically a boundless existence. No one knows exactly where the limits of the Immortal Dimension are. So you can imagine exactly how many powers reside in the Immortal Dimension. They can be said to be as numerous as grains of sand and dense like the starry sky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi listened seriously and was deeply afraid of missing the slightest detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But no matter how many powers there are, there’s a difference between them in the end, and the Immortal Dimension is no exception. The Zuoqiu Clan is one of the top amongst them, and it’s also one of the most ancient powers.” When she spoke up to here, Bai Wanqing made an extremely vivid comparison. “Look at the Dark Reverie, it’s boundlessly vast and filled with numerous powers. But it’s controlled by the 10 great immortal sects and six lineages of the devil sect. However, are they the strongest powers? No, because there are still the Secluded Paradises and Unknown Lands, and there are also ancient clans like my Bai Clan that are capable of going against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Zuoqiu Clan’s status in the Immortal Dimension is roughly equivalent to the status of the Unknown Lands and Secluded Paradises in the Dark Reverie. You can imagine how monstrous the forces of the Zuoqiu Clan are since they’re capable of possessing such status in the Immortal Dimension.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she spoke up to here, Bai Wanqing’s eyes couldn’t help but carry a wisp of emotion. “The facts are indeed so. According to my knowledge, in the history of the Zuoqiu Clan, there’s more than one Immortal King that commanded the winds and clouds and howled proudly through the three dimensions!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked in his heart. Even though he hadn’t arrived at the Immortal Dimension yet, he was still able to imagine that since it was able to reside in the Immortal Dimension and expand its power to such a terrifying extent, the Zuoqiu Clan’s resources and reserves were obviously extraordinarily deep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially when he heard the words ‘Immortal King,’ Chen Xi’s heart couldn’t help but shake.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Immortal King, a king of a myriad of immortals. What sort of terrifying strength would be required to obtain this glory?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was unable to imagine it, nor did he dare to imagine it because all of this had exceeded his knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he hadn’t arrived at the Immortal Dimension, and he was only an Earthly Immortal Realm expert now. He was still extremely far away from such a realm in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing glanced at Chen Xi and said with a smile, “Of course, the Zuoqiu Clan isn’t the ruler of the Immortal Dimension, and it isn’t that there are no powers in existence that are capable of going against the Zuoqiu Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi knew that Bai Wanqing was consoling him, and he took a deep breath before his expression returned to calm and said, “Aunt Bai, go on. I was mentally prepared a long time ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wisp of a gratified expression flashed in Bai Wanqing’s eyes, and then she nodded and said, “Right, everyone ridiculed you all those years ago in Pine Mist City, yet who would have imagined that after this short period of a few tens of years, you would be able to obtain such accomplishments? At the bottom of it all, &nbsp;it all depends on your own effort.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and he was praised to the point of being slightly embarrassed. But after all of this, he was really much more relaxed in his heart, and it wasn’t so heavy as it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your mother, Zuoqiu Xue, is a disciple of the Zuoqiu Clan. Moreover, she’s a direct descendant with a noble status. She’s peerlessly brilliant and a deserving holder of the title of genius.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing restrained her smile and said, “But unfortunately, an extremely vast internal strife erupted in the Zuoqiu Clan, causing the whereabout of the Zuoqiu Clan’s Patriarch to be unknown, whereas your mother fell to become a prisoner overnight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi clenched his fist tightly in secret when he heard this. Even if Bai Wanqing had spoken in a sufficiently simple manner, how could he be unable to determine how great the harm such an unexpected event would have brought to his mother?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know exactly how that internal strife occurred, and I only know that your mother escaped the Immortal Dimension with the help of her older brother Zuoqiu Feng and arrived in the Dark Reverie.” When she spoke up to here, Bai Wanqing’s expression actually surged with dense ridicule that even contained resentment. “Originally, your mother knew that she was unable to go against the Zuoqiu Clan, and she was utterly dejected and intended to reside in the Mortal Dimension. But never had she expected that all of this was only the beginning of a plot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A plot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s eyes narrowed as cold lights appeared within them, and then he interrupted. “Aunt Bai, was that plot carried out by Zuoqiu Feng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still clearly remembered that when he entered the Manor within the jade pendant for the first time, his mother Zuoqiu Xue had once said that she was taken away by his uncle. In other words, wasn’t it Zuoqiu Feng?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing was stunned and seemed to have never expected that Chen Xi would actually guess it immediately, and then she nodded and said, “Exactly, this plot did indeed come from Zuoqiu Feng. Actually, your mother had her suspicious all those years ago. After all, the place that she was kept in was a core area of the Zuoqiu Clan, and it was utterly impossible for Zuoqiu Feng to rescue her on his own.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, your mother trusted this older brother of hers too deeply, and even if she suspected something, she took it to be a coincidence and luck.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Wanqing sighed. “She only understood later on that all everything Zuoqiu Feng did was from the instructions of a great figure in the Zuoqiu Clan, and it was for the sake of the mysterious precious treasure of the three dimensions, the River Diagram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The River Diagram!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The River Diagram again!</span></p>

He knew very well that the clues related to the River Diagram in his mother’s possession didn’t contain the River Diagram at all, and it was merely a Manor!</span></p>

Strictly speaking, it was merely a Manor of inheritance that Senior Fuxi had left behind to his inheritor!</span></p>

Regardless of which fragment it was, all of them weren’t related to the Manor at all!</span></p>

His strength was extremely weak, and he was only at the Violet Palace Realm. But, it just so happened that such a person obtained the heart of your mother…”</span></p>

This couldn’t be described as luck, and it was simply like a legendary story.</span></p>

Of course, for the sake of obtaining the River Diagram from your mother, Zuoqiu Feng gave out a lot like cultivation techniques, medicinal pills, magic treasures… So long as he was able to make your mother happy, he would practically fulfill any request.” When she mentioned Zuoqiu Feng, the corners of Bai Wanqing’s mouth was suffused with an expression of ridicule once more. “Unfortunately, Zuoqiu Feng didn’t notice at all that your mother had already faintly seen through his thoughts and feigned ignorance. In secret, she was actually using every single method available to her to improve your father’s strength because it was impossible for her to defeat Zuoqiu Feng by herself.”</span></p>

With the guidance of his mother, Zuoqiu Xue, who was a direct descendant of an ancient power in the Immortal Dimension, it was impossible for him to not become stronger!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
