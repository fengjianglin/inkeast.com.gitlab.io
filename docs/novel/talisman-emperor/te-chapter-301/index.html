 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unity Darkgold Sword, high-grade earth-rank. Withdraw your Magic Treasure, otherwise, you won’t even have the chance to struggle.” Wei Feng shook the sword in his hand, causing it to emit a clear howl, and the sparkling gold talisman markings on the blade surged and swirled about with an oppressive sharp qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi smiled as he withdrew the Talisman Armament and casually held it in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to fight me with that piece of trash? I’ll give you one final chance, hand over the precious treasure and I’ll spare your life.” Wei Feng sized up the sword in Chen Xi’s hand, and a trace of disdain gushed out once more from his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his eyes, Chen Xi’s sword was completely pitch black and lusterless, and it simply seemed like a fire stick that had just been drawn out from the furnace. Besides possessing an appearance that was like a sword, it didn’t have the slightest distinguishing feature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Wei Feng, this fellow obviously won’t repent until death. You’re preaching to deaf ears by saying so much to him.” Zhong Liao spoke from the side, and his fat face was covered in an impatient expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stood unmoving and ignored it completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Feng couldn’t help but grunt coldly when he saw this. “Since you want to court death, then you can’t blame me. Take this!” As soon as he finished speaking, a cold light abruptly appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable cold light flashed past and seemed like a venomous serpent that had always been concealed in the shadows had suddenly bared its fangs, and it vanished as if it had never appeared in a tenth of an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the next moment, a sword had already appeared out of thin air before Wei Feng’s throat, and its tip silently flickered with a sharp and chilly sword light. If was 3cm away from Wei Feng’s neck, no more no less, and it was as if it was measured by a ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Feng had a dumbstruck expression as he maintained the posture of swinging his sword, and he didn’t move in the slightest. A layer of goosebumps had arisen on the skin of his throat. Moreover, a drop of gorgeous and scarlet blood had appeared on his adam’s apple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bead of sweat the size of a bean rolled down his cheek as Wei Feng’s entire body remained petrified, and he’d lost his spirited expression from before as his expression was filled with terror as his body went cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was able to clearly feel how sharp the sword light 3m before his throat was, and it was like the sickle of the god of death and a slight movement was capable of reaping his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even more so didn’t dare make any rash moves, as his intuition told him that so long as he made the slightest movement, this pitch black and lusterless sword wouldn’t hesitate in the slightest to penetrate his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he recalled the instant from before when he’d just finished speaking and this sword had already extremely accurately arrived 3cm before his throat with a speed that was like a bolt of lightning, he couldn’t restrain a feeling of great horror from emerging from his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that not to mention a fire stick, even if it was a leaf, it would be sufficient to instantly kill him if it shot out as such a speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I…admit defeat.” Wei Feng’s voice was hoarse and dry, not a shred of disdain and arrogance could be heard from it, and it instead revealed a sense of terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword vanished as if it had never appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Feng’s heart that was at his throat had finally eased up, and then he gulped down a mouthful of saliva with great difficult. After all, he didn’t even dare make a single move when the tip of the sword oppressed his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he only had a single thought in his mind —&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I can’t offend this person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Wei Feng, you…” The nearby Zhong Liao stared blankly at the scene before him and fiercely rubbed his tiny eyes with an expression of disbelief on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s sword strike was too swift, to the point it decided victory and defeat in only an instant, and it had already exceeded his wildest imaginations. He truly didn’t dare believe that a fellow at the initial-stage of the Golden Core Realm was actually capable of executing such a swift sword strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How can this be possible?

His heart couldn’t help but thump when he saw Chen Xi looking over towards him, and he actually didn’t dare meet Chen Xi’s gaze.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I and Junior brother Zhong came together with the intention of heading to Azure County to participate in the Goldlake Meeting, yet we noticed vast phenomenon of the heavens and the earth arising in this area of the Swallowray Mountain Range. We thought a precious treasure had appeared in the world, so we searched for three days and three nights before coming all the way here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goldlake Meeting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. The Azure County holds a Goldlake Meeting every 100 years. Only Golden Core Realm cultivators under the age of 30 are able to participate, and it’s a grand event in the cultivation world of Azure County and even the entire central plains. At that time, numerous Golden Core Realm experts of the younger generation will participate in it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems to be more or less like the Allstar Meeting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist… Wait no, Senior. There’s something you don’t know, the Goldlake Meeting is held in preparation for the Allstar Meeting. In the Goldlake Meetings in the past, so long as it was a cultivator that was capable of obtaining 100 successive victories, then the cultivator would normally possess an 80% chance to enter the top 100 in the Allstar Meeting. So the young geniuses all around the world take the Goldlake Meeting as a whetstone and utilize it to predict their ranking in the Allstar Meeting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so that’s how it is. Then will there be many experts participating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Numerous, extremely numerous. Not only will there be experts from our central plains, even many of the cultivators of the northern barbaric lands and eastern sea are attracted over by its fame. But some of the top experts won’t participate. For example, the Whitecrane Sect’s Qin Xiuyi, the Merak Pavilion’s Zhao Qinghe, the Wise King’s Estate’s Huangfu Changtian, and many others. To them, they would surely have a place in the top 10 of the Allstar meeting, so there wasn’t much meaning in participating in the Goldlake Meeting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huangfu Changtian? What’s his relationship with Huangfu Chongming?”</span></p>

Moreover, there wasn’t a bit of resentment in their hearts, and there was only a trace of gratefulness and rejoicing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple, Chen Xi’s didn’t make a move to annihilate them, and he’d even agreed to let them go once they answered his questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was simply a blessing from heaven to them. After all, incidents of one being killed for one’s treasures frequently occurred in the cultivation world, and cultivators like Chen Xi who disregarded their misdeeds and let them off magnanimously was simply rare like qilin horns and phoenix feathers. So how could they dare arouse a trace of resentment and displeasure in their hearts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Qinghe, could he be the disciple of that slovenly old Daoist?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A flash of insight arose in Chen Xi’s mind, and he recalled the slovenly old Daoist that took away the Ancient Fiendgod and the cold young man by his side. He’d heard clearly that the slovenly old Daoist had called his disciple as Qinghe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d once heard the slovenly old Daoist say that with Zhao Qinghe’s strength, it was sufficient to enter the top 10 rankings in the Allstar meeting, but it would be dangerous if he wanted to compete for the top 3 rankings. Supposedly, the Allstar Meeting this time was different from normal and many old fellows that lived in seclusion from the world had ordered their disciples to come out into the world to participate in the Allstar Meeting. In this way, if figures like Qin Xiuyi and Huangfu Changtian were added on, the Allstar Meeting this time would really have experts that were numerous like the clouds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, can we leave now?” When they saw Chen Xi falling into deep thought, Wei Feng felt even more perturbed in his heart, and he couldn’t help but muster up enough courage to ask carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi returned to his senses and said, “Oh, go ahead, I’ll go with the both of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?” Wei Feng and Zhong Liao took a glance at each other and saw a perturbed and uneasy expression in each other’s eyes, and they thought that Chen Xi wanted to go back on his word and eliminate them on the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’re you screaming for? It’s your fortune that my Master wants to travel with the two of you. You two are really a pair of ignorant idiots.” Mu Kui berated loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, could it be that you want to head to Azure County and participate in the Goldlake Meeting?” Wei Feng wasn’t stupid, and with a slight thought, he vaguely guessed Chen Xi’s thoughts. But he still had to confirm it so as to avoid anything unexpected from happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could a golden wyrm be something that belongs in a pond, and it would transform into a dragon once it encountered a stormy situation? It’s named quite boldly. I of course wouldn’t miss a grand event like this.” Chen Xi nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With Senior’s strength, you’ll surely be able to easily obtain 100 successive victories in the Goldlake Meeting, and you’ll transform into a dragon with a single leap and become well renowned in the world.” Wei Feng completely relaxed, and he didn’t forget to flatter Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. Senior’s ability is absolutely unprecedented and unsurpassed, and it’s extremely easily for Senior to obtain 100 successive victories.” Zhong Liao had a face covered in smiles as he hurriedly gave a resounding line of flattery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. If you two continue speaking like this, then I can’t be sure that both of you will be able to walk out of Swallowray Mountain Range alive.” Chen Xi swept the two people with his gaze and spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them shuddered with fear and didn’t dare flatter Chen Xi for no reason again, and they hurriedly transformed into streaks that led the way ahead. They’d already discerned that Chen Xi was absolutely not one who could be compared to one of those domineering young men that possessed extraordinary ability, and he utterly didn’t want their flattery…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Azure County City was 15,000km from the Swallowray Mountain Range, but for Golden Core Realm cultivators like Chen Xi, this little bit of distance only required 10 minutes of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along the way, Chen Xi saw numerous cultivators hurrying on to Azure County City; there were both male and female with extremely young appearances with heroic and prosperous bearings. They either moved in streaks, traveled on Magic Treasures, or rode on spirit beasts as they embellished the entire sky to the point it was majestic, gorgeous, and multicolored, and it seemed to be extraordinarily bustling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, these people had all come for the Goldlake Meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Chen Xi noticed all along the way that the everything discussed by these people was related to the Goldlake Meeting, and it allowed him to obtain even more knowledge about this meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine Dragon Treasured Carriage! It’s the Zhou Clan’s Fourth Young Master. I never expected that he has come as well!” Right at the instant Chen Xi was in deep thought, an exclaim of shock suddenly resounded out beneath the distance sky. Instantly, the 100 plus cultivators that were originally rushing on their way moved to the side in unison, and they opened up an extremely spacious pathway in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Zhou Clan’s Fourth Young Master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he raised his eyes to glance behind him. He saw nine enormous wyrms with two strands of whiskers at the side of their mouths. They were 3km long and completely covered in icy cold scales, and they pulled a treasured carriage that was large like a hall, of icy cold and heavy construction, and was filled with a noble aura. The nine wyrms and the carriage crushed the sky as it sped over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, there were respectively 36 young women and 36 handsome young men on each side of the treasured carriage. All of them wore luxurious clothes and embroidered robes while holding flags in their hands, and on the flag was an extremely overbearing ‘</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">周</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">’ character written with coiling and powerful strokes.[1.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">周</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;= Zhou]</span></p>
