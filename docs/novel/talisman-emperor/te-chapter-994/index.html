He was a supreme expert that caused the expressions of the people of the three dimensions to turn pale just from mentioning his name!</span></p>

He seemed to have seen the entire Netherworld return once more to a state of unity and order under the control of the Third Netherworld Emperor.</span></p>

Amidst this silent atmosphere, his voice was suffused with a unique sad an emotional feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, all of this wasn’t my intention.”</span></p>

Gods are unable to violate it, and the Immortals and Buddhas are unable to meddle in it. In this way, black and white will be used as an example, good and bad will have an end, clear and muddy will be distinguished clearly. Everything would be in order, and all beings would be under its jurisdiction…”</span></p>

He wanted to transfer the order in the cycle of reincarnation to the myriad of worlds in the universe, and he wanted to allow all the living beings in the myriad of worlds to belong under the jurisdiction of a type of systematic order!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, it was precisely because this objective was too grand that it touched the limits the gods and Buddhas of the world could tolerate, and he suffered calamity in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they didn’t understand, King Chu Jiang and the others were clearly aware that if they still didn’t make a move, then they would probably perish here today.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So they couldn’t flee or beg for mercy. There was only a single path that lay before them now, and it was to give it their all and fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But…</span></p>

If they were to fight with their lives on the line, wouldn’t they be no different than ants who were trying to shake a tree, wouldn’t it be no different than courting death?</span></p>

They felt their opponent was impossible to shake, and they felt powerless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only difference was that Chen Xi had the protection of the tiny cauldron, so he didn’t feel dejection and despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, King Chu Jiang and the others didn’t have such luck.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without informing each other or any discussion, it was practically like tacit understanding as King Chu Jiang, King Qin Guang, and King Song Di attacked ferociously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

In an instant, the entire area above the cliff was enveloped by extremely dense and seething Golden Immortal Laws Energy, and it surged like an ocean and was vast like an abyss while it emanated boundless blazing light that was capable of shaking the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s figure remained still like a rock when facing this, and he seemed as if he was on the other side. No matter how monstrous those attacks were, they were actually unable to touch him at all, let alone harm him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed to have left the scope of the three dimensions and the five elements.</span></p>

They were mighty like scorching suns in the sky, and they intended to tear the Myriad Flow Godcage Formation to break open a path to survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only in this way would they be able to obtain a chance at survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qi Shanhe?” Chen Xi seemed to stop paying attention to all of this, and he turned around instead before his deep and ancient gaze descended onto the nearby Nether Spring Grand Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is this disciple.” The Nether Spring Grand Emperor cupped his hands while his cold and thin face actually revealed a wisp of pleasant surprise, and then it was replaced by a devoted and fervent expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An innumerable years ago, Qi Shanhe was still a disciple of the Nether Spring Hall at that time. He was a young man that was full of spirit, and he looked down proudly at his peers and was considered a peerless figure with extraordinary natural talent in the younger generation. It was precisely because of this that he once had the fortune to meet the Third Netherworld Emperor with his Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he merely met the Third Netherworld Emperor. At that time, not to mention himself, even his master was no different than an ordinary person in the eyes of the Netherworld Emperor, so the Netherworld Emperor would naturally not pay much attention to Qi Shanhe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Qi Shanhe had never imagined that after so long, the Third Netherworld Emperor would actually still remember the name of a nobody like him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he not be pleasantly surprised by this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the people of the outside world knew Qi Shanhe’s thoughts, it would surely cause all their jaws to drop because if the Nether Spring Grand Emperor was a nobody, then what were they?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, when it was in comparison to the Third Netherworld Emperor, it was very easy to be accepted by others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because compared to the Third Netherworld Emperor, no matter if it was the Nether Spring Grand Emperor, the Master of Granny Meng Hall, the Governor of the City of the Wronged, the Grand Ministers of the Six Paths of Hell, or the Ten Kings of Hell, all of them were juniors to the Third Netherworld Emperor, so it was logical for them to call themselves nobodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll temporarily leave these treasures in your care.” Chen Xi spoke as he passed the Condemn Evil Brush and Netherworld Register to the Nether Spring Grand Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nether Spring Grand Emperor felt his mind drone, and he was almost dazed. He didn’t dare believe this was happening, causing him to actually become bewildered. When such an appearance appeared on an old senior that had lived for countless years, it obviously showed how great the shock he received was.</span></p>

That place won’t tolerate the existence of these two treasures.” Chen Xi sighed and actually revealed a wisp of helplessness.</span></p>
