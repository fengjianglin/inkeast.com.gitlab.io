He was completely devoid of an aura, and he seemed to have broken free from this world since long ago.</span></p>

Emperor Chu had once promised the Bloodcrescent Devil Sect behind her that he would send her into the Primeval Battlefield, so he naturally wouldn’t abandon her.</span></p>

The enormous stone was dim and lusterless, covered in mottled marks, and it emitted an ancient aura as if it had endured countless years of time and had always existed here since ancient times.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi’s gaze looked silently at the ancient ring of stone.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of Chen Xi and the others went serious as they restrained their thoughts and listened respectfully.</span></p>

According to my estimations, even though all of you are considered to be top geniuses in the younger generation of the Darchu Dynasty with your current strengths, yet if it’s in the Primeval Battlefield, then all of you would probably only be barely able to attain the level of ordinary experts, and all of you are still a distance away from top experts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words Emperor Chu spoke caused the expressions of Chen Xi and the others to go serious and heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past seven days, the Civil Marquis had explained to them about some matters outside the Darchu Dynasty. Presently, all of them already knew that there were hundreds of Dynasties existing outside the Darchu Dynasty, and the Darchu Dynasty was merely one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, amongst these numerous Dynasties, the entire strength of the Darchu Dynasty’s cultivation world could only be considered to be average, and there was quite a difference when compared to some large Dynasties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, all the top geniuses of these Dynasties were about to converge within the Primeval Battlefield to seize the spots to enter the Dark Reverie, so it was obvious how brutal the competition would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, if Chen Xi and the others enter the Primeval Battlefield, then they would surely encounter a variety of geniuses. All of them came from the other various Dynasties, and there was no lack of people that were even more abnormal than Chen Xi and Qing Xiuyi amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they wanted to become eminent from amongst these geniuses, then it was bound to be accompanied by boundless danger and hardships, and it was even to the extent that it was very likely that they would lose their lives in the Primeval Battlefield and become the stepping stone of another…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember, advance to the Rebirth Realm as soon as possible after you enter the Primeval Battlefield. Only in this way would you be able to possess sufficient strength to protect yourselves.” Emperor Chu instructed once more before nodding towards the old man that sat cross-legged on the stone stairs, and he said indifferently, “Begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man suddenly opened his eyes, and then he slowly stood up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi and the others noticed to their shock that along with the old man’s bent and gaunt body slowly standing up, the terrifying aura that gushed out from his body along with this action grew stronger and stronger. Up until the end, at the instant the old man’s back straightened, the monstrous aura on him actually caused the heavens and the earth to tremble and wail!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, this ordinary old man that was devoid of an aura seemed to have transformed into a supreme god, and as his eyes opened and closed, winds and clouds surged as everything submitted before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi, Qing Xiuyi, and Zhao Qinghe had once met this old man, and they knew this old man was an exceedingly formidable old fellow, so the shock in their hearts was much less.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were different. When they saw this scene, they were shocked to the point their expressions turned slightly pale, and they were even unable to breathe. Especially the fatty, Ling Yu, he was shocked to the point his plump face trembled, causing it to be an extremely amusing sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old man stood up, he didn’t say a single word before directly heading over to stand before the formation and lightly stroking the formation for a short period of time, and then he stretched out a palm towards the center of the formation and pressed on it lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi and the others felt a piercing pain in their eyes, and when they opened their eyes once more, a beam of light that was connected to the sky had already gushed out from the center of the ring of stone. The beam of light was suffused with golden rays of light and surging talisman markings, and it seemed to arrive directly at the other side of the universe that was in the depths of the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Xi, Qing Xiuyi, all of you swiftly enter the formation!” Emperor Chu’s loud shout resounded out by their ears, causing Chen Xi and the others to make a move at almost the exact same time and without the slightest hesitation. Their figures flashed, and they’d already transformed into 11 flowing lights that directly charged into the beam of light. Divine lights flowed all around them, and in the next moment, they’d already vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with Chen Xi and the others vanishing within the beam of light, the phenomena in the surroundings of the formation vanished instantly, causing it to recover its original appearance. The only difference was that the enormous stones in the surroundings of the formation seemed to have become even more mottled and aged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the old man had retracted his arm as well, and then he withdrew back to where he was previously. He seemed to have exhausted a great deal of energy, causing his face to be covered in wrinkles while an expression of exhaustion suffused his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry to have troubled you.” Emperor Chu withdrew his gaze from the formation and spoke to the old man in a light voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s exhausting 10,000 years of cultivation when compared to the future of the Darchu Dynasty?” The old man shook his head, and then he directly returned to the stone stairs and sat down cross-legged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, for the sake of the Darchu Dynasty’s future.” Emperor Chu sighed, and then he muttered. “Exactly what accomplishments all of you obtain in the Primeval Battlefield will depend on your own fortune. I hope that all of you can enter the Dark Reverie safely…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>(8/14) Chapters of the week!<br><br>Yay!! Early end to book seven!! XD<br><br>Short clarification before I go on to other matters, the Roc bone does contain water, lightning, and devour Grand Daos, but the technique was created by his Senior Brother through the bone. So, it makes sense that he added star in because star plays a great role in their inheritance from Oracle Mountain.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(5, 45, 73); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-line; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none">Stay tuned for the launch of God of Illusions by Seven Little Eagles, my 2nd novel that will be posted in Volare from the 12th of July.</span> <span style="color: rgb(5, 45, 73); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-line; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none">It's a fairly new ongoing novel from an up-and-coming author with only 250+ chapters so far, and I fell in love with it as soon as i started reading, so I decided to TL it.</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(5, 45, 73); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-line; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none">I don't have a synopsis written yet, but I'll give a short and sweet idea of what to expect. It's about a continent filled with puppet masters and magical beasts, and the MC is an illusion puppet master. The first book was just finished in CN around a week ago, and my impression so far is that it's a really funny and balanced novel. When I say balanced I mean it's about wit and teamwork, and it isn't about a string of 'fortuitous encounters' and the MC being OP like a god.</span></p>

Also, the fresh idea of puppets is a huge plus!</span>&nbsp;<br><br>P.S. If any sponsors see this, I'll be giving sponsors a sneak peek to the first chapter in a few days once the sponsor only announcement system is 100% up and running. :D</p>
