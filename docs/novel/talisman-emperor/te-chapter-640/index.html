 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for Shang Que obtaining the protection of an Earthly Immortal Realm expert at the final moment, he’d probably have died a long time ago, and he would utterly be unable to enter the Heartcontrol Swordhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, Shang Que had become the one and only survivor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, the appearance of this young man called Wen Daoran had caused Chen Xi to recall Shang Que at the first possible moment. After all, he hadn’t eliminated the weeds by the root, and the existence of Shang Que was a latent danger in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really wanted to ask if Shang Que had come to Icesky City, and if it was like this, he would be able to find a chance to completely eliminate this latent danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, when he looked at Wen Daoran once more, Wen Daoran had already vanished without a trace, and the damaged copy of the Heaven Refinement Furnace had left with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard the Heartcontrol Swordhouse is determined to obtain the treasures within the Dark Parasol’s Abyss this time, and they’ve dispatched numerous first-rate Seed Disciple’s. Wen Daoran is the leading figure amongst them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. Wen Daoran possesses a superb physique and exceedingly high accomplishments in Sword Insight. Supposedly, a thought in his heart was capable of transforming everything into swords, and he’s even capable of exerting six times his combat strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Six times his combat strength? My god! Such natural endowments can already be considered to be a top existence amongst those of the same generation, right? Even if it’s within the 10 great immortal sects, there are probably very few that possess such strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is only a guess. Even if he hasn’t cultivated to this level, he’s probably not far away. Now, he has even purchased a copy of the Heaven Refinement Furnace, so he doesn’t have to worry about being unable to comprehend the Spatial Grand Dao once he advances to the Earthly Immortal Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Wen Daoran had left, everyone was still unable to conceal the excitement in their hearts from being able to see this brilliant figure that was renowned in the world, and they discussed without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi smiled instead when he heard all this, and he showed neither approval or disapproval because he’d seen more than one outstanding genius that was on par with Wen Daoran at the highest level of the Ice Cloud Pavilion. For example, the Nether Spring Devil Sect’s Qiu Jun, the Truth Embrace Sect’s Daoist Crimson Sun, the Heavenflow Dao Sect’s Leng Chan’er, and so on and so forth. So he naturally wouldn’t be surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh, what’s this?” Chen Xi was right about to leave when his gaze inadvertently swept out, and he was instantly drawn by an object at the other side of the stall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This object was 1.3m in length, thick like a thumb, and completely black and dirty. It was covered in damaged and fragmented talisman markings, and it seemed to be rather ancient and like the tendon of a demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the cultivators that were crowded around this stall had left successively after the sale of the Heaven Refinement Furnace, and only a scarce few people still remained standing around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, besides that copy of the Heaven Refinement Furnace, the numerous things in this stall look to be old yet are extremely damaged and not of any great use.” Someone sighed lightly as he picked up a damaged piece of bronze and rubbed it with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense! Look at this Black Phoenix Tendon. It’s 1.3m in length, and it’s absolutely a rare material.” The skinny old man refuted right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a shrewd expression and intentionally glanced at Chen Xi as he spoke. Obviously, he’d noticed Chen Xi seemed to be interested with this treasure, and he’d changed the topic because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullshit! Isn’t this just an extremely ordinary tendon of an Earth Dragon? You just inscribed some talisman markings on it and dare to pass it off as the tendon of a Black Phoenix? Do you think everyone is an idiot and would be deceived and tricked by you?” Someone sneered with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man chuckled dryly and said, “Fellow Daoist, don’t make irresponsible remarks. All the treasures in this stall were obtained by me from a secret realm, and they possess shocking value. They’re absolutely existences at the level of treasures of the heavens and the earth. Even though these treasures are slightly damaged and tattered, there might be something precious hidden within them. According to my estimations, that secret realm was absolutely left behind by a great figure of the primeval times.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the old man started introducing the black and dirty tendon shaped object before him once again. “This Black Phoenix Tendon was similarly obtained from that secret realm. How could a lowly Earth Dragon’s tendon possibly compare with it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, stop blowing your own trumpet. All of us aren’t fledglings that are completely inexperienced, so how could we be deceived by these fakes of yours?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Truly laughable! If it’s really a divine object like the tendon of a Black Phoenix, would you sell it off? That’s a true precious treasure, so stop cheating people here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man laughed dryly without end, and he was slightly depressed in his heart. this thing was indeed obtained from within that secret realm yet after he carefully inspected it, he noticed it was only an ordinary material, a tendon of an Earth Dragon, and he was rather disgruntled in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he’d gone through many hardships in order to find that secret realm, and he originally thought it was an abode left behind by a great figure from the primeval times and the treasures stored within it ought to be some extremely rare and precious treasures. How could he have imagined that a piece of trash like the tendon of an Earth Dragon would appear there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi walked forward and picked up the black and dirty tendon shaped object before sizing it up instead. This object was extremely heavy and felt icy cold and soft to the touch. But, after he inspected it carefully, he didn’t notice anything special about it, and it was indeed just like the tendon of an Earth Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he wouldn’t be deceived by the outward appearance of this object. Earlier, he’d inspected it with the Eye of Divine Truth, and there were secrets hidden within this object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The skinny old man’s spirits were instantly refreshed when he saw Chen Xi seeming to be extremely interested, and he said, “Fellow Daoist, you have a good discerning eye, and you’ve finally noticed the extraordinariness of this item. This is a great material. I don’t require a Quasi Immortal Artifact for it, and it only costs a single top-grade heaven-rank magic treasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re really a cheat, and even worse than a shop that traps the ignorant. When has an Earth Dragon’s tendon become so expensive? Why didn’t I know about it?” Chen Xi grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nearby cultivators roared with laughter, and it caused the skinny old man to be extremely embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is an earth-rank magic treasure. It ought to be sufficient in exchange for your Earth Dragon’s tendon, right?” Chen Xi took out an earth-rank magic treasure as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…is barely enough.” The skinny old man had an expression of difficulty, yet his movements weren’t slow, and he grabbed over the earth-rank magic treasure with one hand before directly passing over the tendon with the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Brother, the stalls here make deals instantly. Once it leaves the hand, you absolutely can’t go back on the deal.” The skinny old man reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course,” said Chen Xi as he nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Nice! I knew Young Brother is extraordinary at first glance! Why don’t you see if you need anything else? I can give you a cheaper price.” The skinny old man laughed cunningly. An earth-rank magic treasure was sufficient to buy a few tens of tendons of an Earth Dragon, and this price had absolutely exceeded his estimations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he left this area, Chen Xi scanned the surroundings and heaved a sigh of relief when he noticed no one was following him. Truthfully speaking, he was rather worried that someone would notice something was fishy after he bought this item, and they would take some excessive actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he could relax and inspect this item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long after, Chen Xi arrived once again before the Ice Cloud Pavilion, but he didn’t ascend the pavilion and sat cross-legged at the side before the Icesoul Divine Tree instead.</span></p>

They had their eyes closed in meditation and were comprehending the profundities of the Grand Dao of Water emitted from the Icesoul Divine Tree.</span></p>

He silently executed the Eye of Divine Truth and carefully inspected this piece of black and dirty tendon.</span></p>

This piece of tendon didn’t seem special at all when inspected with the eye, but, even the slightest detail was visible under the vision of the Eye of Divine Truth.</span></p>

It was actually the aura of Shaman Energy! Moreover, it was the purest and cleanest Shaman Energy.</span></p>

Moreover, these body refinement cultivation techniques were ranked equally with qi refinement cultivation techniques, and they were called the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement.</span></p>

It was impossible to find traces of them in the three dimensions any longer.</span></p>

Its value was so great that it was even more shocking than a Quasi Immortal Artifact. After all, a treasure like this was too rare, and it was far unlike Quasi Immortal Artifacts that could be refined after the materials were gathered.</span></p>

Not only does this Fiendgod Tendon possesses pure Shaman Energy, it’s even branded with the Grand Dao profundities of Wind and Lightning. If it’s utilized to refine the bowstring of the Staruin Bow, its might would surely rise explosively!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After contemplating for a shot moment, Chen Xi suddenly recalled the Shaman Treasure he’d seized from Qi Yin all those years ago, the Staruin Bow. This bow was refined from the bone of a Fiendgod, yet it lacked an extraordinary bowstring, causing it to be impossible to bring forth its true might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he’d obtained the tendon of a Fiendgod by chance, and it just happened to be able to be made into a bowstring. If he refined it successfully, then the might of the Staruin Bow would be able to attain a shocking height!</span></p>
