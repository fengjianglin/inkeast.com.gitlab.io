During this grand meeting, the top great figures of the various powers had participated in it. At that time, there were a total of 37 great figures with exceedingly high cultivations gathered in the Saintly Land of Ascension.”</span></p>

Not only did it contain the supreme inheritance of that almighty figure, it also contained an exceedingly mysterious and precious treasure, the River Diagram.”</span></p>

By relying on it, the Fiendgods of the primeval times had comprehended their own path towards the Dao. They pried into the workings of the heavens, grasped Grand Dao profundities, and ascended the extremity of the Dao!”</span></p>

No matter if it was the Immortal Dimension, the Mortal Dimension, or the Netherworld, all the numerous great figures would fight for it, and that scene that seemed like the end of the world wouldn’t be any different to a true calamity of the three dimensions.”</span></p>

One was from beneath the Profound Disruption Mountain in the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, one was given to him by his mysterious ‘Senior Sister,’ and one more was from the sacrificial altar within the Martial Dao Domain in Silken City.</span></p>

Numerous great figures in the three dimensions had searched bitterly for it, and they returned empty handed in the end. Coupled with the calamity of the Fiendgods erupting during that time, the three dimensions were in an upheaval, so no one paid attention to the whereabouts of the River Diagram any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But, for some unknown reason, 300 years ago, the Sect Master of the Saintly Land of Ascension, Miao Yunji, obtained a piece of information by coincidence. There was a Star Manor that had appeared above the Northern Underworld Ocean, and the whereabouts of the River Diagram was hidden within it. So he held the grand meeting and widely invited fellow Daoists with the intention of searching for and obtaining this great fortune together.”</span></p>

Once news of it were to be revealed, it would surely cause a storm in the three dimensions. So, there were only 37 peerless great figures that participated in the grand meeting at that time.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi nodded, and he had an extremely complicated feeling in his heart. He was even able to guess that Miao Yunji and the others were surely unable to obtain the Star Manor and came back empty handed in the end…</span></p>

They were your father, Chen Lingjun, and Zuoqiu Xue.” The old man’s voice unconsciously carried a trace of an emotional and complicated tone when he mentioned these two names.</span></p>

It’s a mysterious clan that no one is able to obtain knowledge about. But Miao Yunji and the others didn’t know all of this, otherwise they would absolutely not dare rashly make a move.” The old man’s eyes looked towards the distant sky, and it was profound, vast, and carried a trace of recollection. “At that time, Miao Yunji and the others lost, were heavily injured, and on the verge of death. At the critical moment, it was your father, Chen Lingjun, that stood out and asked your mother to let them off.”</span></p>

But in the end…” When he spoke up to here, the old man couldn’t help but sigh.</span></p>

Moreover, not a trace of them could be found in the entire Dark Reverie.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi asked abruptly. “How many years ago did this occur?”</span></p>

I’m not sure about the exact time.”</span></p>

After that, he entered the Saintly Land of Ascension and vanished.” The old man said slowly, “The Sect Master of the Bloodnet Devil Sect, Wang Feiqiao, was the person that leaked the news all those years ago, and if it wasn’t for his death, no one in the world would know that your father, Chen Lingjun, had actually reappeared in the Dark Reverie.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He surely returned to his hometown, Pine Mist City, and then had me and Chen Hao. It was precisely during the time Chen Hao had just been born that mother was abducted by a great figure of the Zuoqiu Clan, whereas, father vanished once more…</span></p>

After that, the news of this was leaked by someone, causing them to be pursued by the Zuoqiu Clan, and they fled back to Pine Mist City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after Chen Hao was born, the forces of the Zuoqiu Clan appeared once more in Pine Mist City, and they took mother away. On the other hand, father was furious and pursued them to the Dark Reverie, yet he was unable to catch up to mother, so he turned around to the Bloodnet Devil Sect to kill its Sect Master Wang Feiqiao to vent his rage.</span></p>

All cultivators cultivated and sought the Dao for the sake of ascending into Immortal Dimension and entering the Immortal Dimension. But he’d never heard that there was actually no need to ascend through ordinary methods from the Mortal Dimension, and one could head to the Immortal Dimension through a door.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this is true, then what’s the point of cultivating?</span></p>

The existence of that door is a taboo, and it’s extremely dangerous. Even if it’s one of the great figures within the Saintly Land of Ascension, unless they have no other choice, they would absolutely not dare rashly step foot through that door.”</span></p>

As for the reason, you’ll understand once you’ve truly started to come in contact with the Laws of the Heaven Dao. Your father’s existence has already been taken to be a heretic and criminal by the Laws of the Heaven Dao, and not only is it impossible for him to step foot in the Immortal Dimension for his entire lifetime, so long as he’s noticed by the Laws of the Heaven Dao, then he would suffer a calamity.”</span></p>

Ji Yu was similarly a criminal of the Three Dimensions whose existence wasn’t tolerated by the Laws of the Heaven Dao, so he could only stay in a small world to avoid being noticed by the Laws of the Heaven Dao.</span></p>
