 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene happened too swiftly, and it was too unbelievable. Not to mention Chen Xi hadn’t expected it, even the tiny cauldron wasn’t in time to stop this scene from occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an existence whose strength was comparable to a Heavenly Immortal and was capable of deceiving the detection of the Heaven Dao of the three dimensions to sneak into the Dark Reverie, so she surely couldn’t be compared to by an ordinary cultivator, and it was even to the extent that it was extremely likely for her to be an extraordinary figure amongst the Xeno-race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, she’d actually sacrificed her life for the sake of destroying the bronze pagoda, and this resolute and ruthless style and disposition to take death calmly caused Chen Xi’s heart to go cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was unable to imagine that if all the Xeno-race experts were ruthless like Xuan Kui, then what sort of calamity would it be to the living beings of the three dimensions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Chen Xi could recover from his shock, the bronze pagoda transformed into a rain of a myriad of pieces that spread into the surroundings, and it drowned out this entire expanse of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient sacrificial altar was within this expanse of space, causing it to instantly suffer an extremely great impact. The numerous divine medicine that grew on it were incinerated into nothingness, and even the sacrificial altar suffered heavy damage and was on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a wisp of bloody light charged out from within this expanse of chaos, and it transformed into a stalwart and mighty figure. The clothes worn by the figure were old and worn-out while his hair that was white as snow hung down to his waist. His shoulders were like two lofty mountains that spanned across the land, and his backbone was like the pillar that held up the sky. Even though his clothes were tattered, it was impossible to conceal his supreme elegant bearing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face was white and could only be considered to be delicate and good looking, but his eyes were boundlessly deep. The sun and moon rose and fell while lightning and the glow of stars were formed within his eyes, and it seemed to be narrating the ancient secrets of the heavens from countless years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He caused others to be unable to help but arouse deep reverence when facing him, and it was like an ant facing a god, one would wish for nothing more than to kneel down in worship and not dare disrespect him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is…</span></p>

It was simply like he was facing a supreme ruler, and his mind and body were deeply suppressed by the indescribable dignified aura emitted by this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a Heavenly Immortal would probably tremble with fear and be extremely cautious when facing such a figure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most shocking to Chen Xi was the hands and legs of this mysterious white haired person were actually shackled by chains. Moreover, these shackles had talisman markings interweaved together with them and suffused with Chaotic Qi, and they were profound and unfathomable like a divine chain of order that was capable of confining everything in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How many years have passed, I’ve finally escaped confinement to see the light of day once again! Hahaha! Could it be that the three dimensions are about to undergo an upheaval once again, and the gods are busy with their own affairs?” The white haired mysterious figure roared with laughter that carried a trace of delight and a strand of resentment, and it was like a thunderclap that rumbled as it echoed throughout every inch of space in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sound was too great, and it shook Chen Xi to the point his vital blood roiled while his mind was dazed, and he saw stars before his eyes. It was uncomfortable to the point he was on the verge of spitting blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never expected that the Heavenly Suppression Pagoda was actually suppressing a Xeno-race Saint Emperor within it. Unfortunately, even if you’ve escaped today, it’s impossible for you to escape death!” The tiny cauldron spoke abruptly with an icy cold voice that was filled with killing intent and slight astonishment, but his voice mostly carried deep detest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as the tiny cauldron spoke, Chen Xi instantly felt his entire body feel relaxed while all the uncomfortableness in his body vanished without a trace. Only now did Chen Xi heave a sigh of relief before looking at the white haired mysterious figure with a lingering fear in his heart, and he said.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xeno-race Saint Emperor? What sort of terrifying great figure is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, he finally understood that Xuan Chen and Xuan Kui had absolutely not come to the Door of Profundity for the sake of searching for treasures, and they’d come for the sake of rescuing this white haired mysterious figure that had been suppressed by the Heavenly Suppression Pagoda for countless years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack! Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white haired figure didn’t move yet the shackles on his limbs collapsed inch by inch before transforming into a pile of fragments that rumbled as they fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Even the Heavenly Suppression Pagoda’s Devil Confinement Chains were incapable of killing me, so who dares be impudent before me?” He turned around with a gaze that was like a deep abyss as it shot directly towards the tiny cauldron, and it carried an oppressive aura like a king that had descended to the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha, so it’s only a jade cauldron. Could it be that the gods were worried that I would escape, so they left behind a Saint Artifact beforehand?” When he saw the appearance of the tiny cauldron clearly, the white haired &nbsp;mysterious figure laughed lightly and didn’t conceal his contempt in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The gods suppressed more than one Saint Emperor like you all those years ago, right?” The tiny cauldron suddenly asked a different question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. Besides the Dark Parasol’s Abyss, there are another nine mysterious places in the three dimensions that trap a few more friends of mine, and now that I think about it, they’ve probably escaped as well.” The white haired mysterious figure didn’t mind at all, and he held his hands behind his back while he said indifferently, “This is nothing shameful. The gods of your three dimensions are similarly suppressed within our divine world outside your three dimensions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There are gods of the three dimensions trapped outside the three dimensions as well?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was shocked in his heart and simply didn’t dare believe his ears, and he seemed as if he’d heard an absurd fairy tale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like since the three dimensions are about to undergo an upheaval, your Xeno-race is unwilling to lay low any longer…” The tiny cauldron sighed with a voice that revealed a trace of desolation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xeno-race? Hmph! To all of us, you natives of the three dimensions are the most despicable existences!” The white haired figure grunted coldly with a voice that revealed hatred that came from the bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he actually started to make a move and directly stretched out his hand to grab fiercely at the tiny cauldron. “I’ve already let you know what you should know. Now, you can die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dark lights that were like a sea gushed out along with this grab while his palm seemed to contain the universe, and even space and time was confined by him, causing others to feel a terrifying imposing aura as if they couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt his scalp go numb. He was very sure that if this strike was aimed at him, then merely the imposing aura from it was capable of shattering his soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tiny cauldron wasn’t fearful in the slightest, and it grunted coldly before erupting with a myriad of rays of divinity that interweaved together into a beam of the Laws that resisted the grab of the white haired figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deafening rumble resounded out as even time and space were crushed apart, and a blazing rain of light to completely drown this area, causing Chen Xi to be unable to see exactly what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi let out a muffled groan because being affected by the collision of these enormous forces shook him to the point a mouthful of blood sprayed out from his mouth, and then his entire body was blasted flying. Not to mention resist, he didn’t even have the slightest room to struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was unable to see everything in the surroundings clearly because the battle between the white haired figure and the tiny cauldron was too terrifying, and it had exceeded all his imaginations.
