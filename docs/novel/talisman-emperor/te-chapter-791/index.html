It was a unique energy that rarely possessed any cultivation techniques in the world, and it was even difficult for Heavenly Immortals to grasp it.</span></p>

Chen Xi was actually unable to avoid it because this set of evil treasures had frozen the surrounding space into one, causing it to transform into a small world that enveloped him.</span></p>

Moreover, its might was so formidable that caused others to turn pale just from the mention of it.</span></p>

This was simply like a miracle, the might of a single sword strike had actually blasted the Prime Blood God Flags back, and if it wasn’t for them seeing it with their own two eyes, who would dare believe this?</span></p>

Everyone within the estate that witnessed this scene was shocked speechless and were unable to recover from their shock because this was the ‘slaughtering of immortals’ while surmounting the gap of a realm!</span></p>

If news of this were to be spread out, it would surely shock the world and give rise to a mighty uproar!</span></p>

Every single step he took caused a golden lotus platform to bloom in space, and he was like a king that moved on lotuses. His fierce aura became even sharper as he charged towards Chi Ya and Huang Jiao at the other side.</span></p>

He raised his hand and pointed out, causing an expanse of blood colored light to rain down while blood qi coiled through the entire sky, and it carried a might akin to a mountain pressing down as it enveloped Chen Xi.</span></p>

Even though his face was gorgeous, Chen Xi had a dignified air that emanated the pressure of a sovereign that had descended into the world, and then he slashed out with a raise of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

The rocks, plants, trees, and everything else in the mountain was formed from vengeful and evil spirits that rumbled with a savage, vicious, and fiendish aura.</span></p>

The Talisman Armament soared through the sky while it emitted a thick and large sword qi that shot into the sky, and it was lustrous, dazzling, sharp, and oppressive to the extreme. This was one of the most formidable Dao Arts he’d grasped up until now, and it was the Creation Sword Insight comprehended from the bone left behind by the Exalted Ant Emperor from the primeval times.</span></p>

Otherwise, how could he have possibly been invited over by Huai Ming and the others? However, Chen Xi’s sword strike aroused a terrifying feeling of horror because this sword qi was too frightening. Not only did it deter the body, it even suppressed the soul.</span></p>

Under the astonished gazes of everyone present, Chen Xi’s sword qi actually easily slashed the enormous mountain into two like tofu, whereas Chi Ya didn’t have time to dodge and was slashed into two as well. A rain of blood flowed down while his soul was instantly obliterated by the sword qi!</span></p>
