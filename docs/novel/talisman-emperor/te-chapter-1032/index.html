 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Chen Xi asked about in the city for some time, he came to a single conclusion, and he couldn’t help but feel slightly depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially depressing to him was that his path was obstructed in an alley earlier, and if he didn’t notice something was off and fled beforehand, he would have almost been surrounded by an entire group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, he found out that Immortal Monarch Lin Hao had issued a warrant for him in the entire Eastern Peace Continent, and the reward for him was rather generous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, Chen Xi had become a public target now, and he was absolutely someone that would be chased after as soon as he was noticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his helplessness, Chen Xi could only change his appearance to avoid a great deal of trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, he took the image of a young man with an ordinary appearance and sedate bearing, and he was so ordinary that he wouldn’t cause a ripple when thrown into a crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, this sort of disguise can only deceive ordinary figures. Once I encounter some experts that possesses special Immortal Techniques or Divine Abilities, then they’ll probably be able to see through my disguise.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi walked on the bustling and streaming streets while he frowned without end and being unable to find a teleportation formation and being reduced to a wanted criminal caused the situation he was in to not be promising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his understanding, only two cities in Eastern Peace Continent possessed teleportation formations that were connected to other continents, and one of them was Phoenix Nest City, the place the Immortal Monarch’s Estate resided, so it was directly ignored by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other was situated in Spirit Radiance City, but it was an entire five million kilometers away from Cloudray City. If it was in the Mortal Dimension, then this little bit of distance was naturally unable to pose any difficulty to Chen Xi, and he would be able to teleport over in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this was the Immortal Dimension, and only Golden Immortals could move freely through space. Those beneath the Golden Immortal Realm could only utilize magic treasures or execute movement techniques to carry out their journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, Chen Xi suspected that a large number of troops were set up in Spirit Radiance City a long time ago, and they were just waiting for him to leap into their trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very simple. Immortal Monarch Lin Hao would have surely guessed that if he wanted to escape with his current strength, the only way would be to leave Eastern Peace Continent. There was no other way besides this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that so long as they stood on guard at Phoenix Rest City and Spirit Radiance City, Chen Xi would be like a fish in a net, a turtle in a jar. Along with the passage of time, Chen Xi’s situation would grow more and more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They really intend to do all they can to kill me… Immortal Monarch Lin Hao, no matter who sent you to go against me, Chen Xi, I’ll get even with you one day!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi resolved in his heart. No one would be able to accept being pursued as a wanted criminal as soon as they entered the Immortal Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, Chen Xi had arrived before an extremely grand pavilion that was completely constructed from jade. It towered into the skies and was suffused with a faint cloudy glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the buildings in the surroundings, this pavilion was like a crane amongst chickens, and it was especially striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three ancient and large words ‘Goldwave Immortal Pavilion’ were written on the plaque on the building. The strokes of these words were heavy, powerful, and winding. Just a glance from afar caused a heavy and lofty aura to assault one’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a formidable soul brand! Even though it’s merely a strand, it’s actually heavy like a mountain and seems to be impenetrable. The cultivation of the person that wrote on this plaque is probably at the Golden Immortal Realm or above!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned, and he praised endlessly in his heart. Merely this plaque allowed him to discern how extraordinary the resources and reserves of the Goldwave Immortal Pavilion was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any further hesitation, Chen Xi walked in immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the information he obtained earlier, the Goldwave Immortal Pavilion was a large trading company that was spread throughout the Immortal Dimension, and practically a quarter of the 4,900 continents in the Immortal Dimension had a store that belonged to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said to have bloomed all over, and it was extremely wealthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goldwave Immortal Pavilion didn’t just deal in various precious immortal treasures, it also dealt in medicinal pills, cultivation techniques, spirit medicine, and various other things that were required by cultivators. It could be said to contain and cover everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi had come here for the sake of dealing with some of the Azuresoul Sourcerocks in his possession as he wanted to exchange them for some immortal materials that he needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right at the moment before he stepped foot through the entrance of the Goldwave Immortal Pavilion, a group of male and female attendants suddenly charged through the door and unrolled a scarlet red carpet from within the pavilion until the area outside the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this entire process, those guests that intended to enter the Goldwave Immortal Pavilion like Chen Xi were naturally blocked out to the side. But they didn’t say anything because merely the Goldwave Immortal Pavilion’s reputation caused them to not dare cause any trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, all of these attendants split up into two rows and stood solemnly and respectfully at the sides of the red carpet, and they actually seemed as if they were greeting the arrival of a great figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry everyone. There’s a distinguished guest arriving at my Goldwave Immortal Pavilion today, so I hope everyone can forgive us and come back tomorrow.” A middle aged man that seemed like a manager cupped his fists towards the surroundings and spoke with a warm voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We understand, we understand. But Manager Lion, your Goldwave Immortal Pavilion will probably be losing a few tens of thousands of Immortal Stones by closing for a single day, right?” A guest joked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manager Liao smiled slightly yet didn’t speak any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Manager Liao, may I ask which distinguished guest is arriving to actually make you personally come to welcome his arrival?” Someone else asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manager Liao smiled again when facing this question, and he didn’t answer it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this way, it caused all those guests that were frequent patrons of Goldwave Immortal Pavilion to be even more curious. According to their knowledge, Manager Liao might not even personally welcome the arrival of the Cloudray Sect’s Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, he’d actually mobilized so many attendants and made preparation to welcome this distinguished guest, and this caused everyone to be curious.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that it’s a distinguished guest at the Golden Immortal Realm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi felt even more depressed when facing this situation, and he felt that his luck today seemed to be extremely horrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First, he was unable to find a teleportation formation, then he was pursued as a criminal. Now, he was just intending to make an exchange for some immortal materials yet had the door shut upon his face and was told that they were closing for the day. How could he not feel depressed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi shook his head, and then he turned around and left. As for the identity of the person that was about to arrive at Goldwave Immortal Pavilion, he couldn’t be bothered to find out, let alone have any interest towards it.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Everyone, please leave right now, and you can leave your bills to me.”</span></p>
