Fu Yun and the other elders of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect had extremely gloomy expressions, and their faces seemed to be changing indeterminately under the illumination of the glass lanterns in the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the disciples of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect by their sides were blazing with rage, whereas Chen Yu and Chen An were protected behind Elder Fu Yun.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had a pale appearance that was without any facial hair. He wore a green robe, and his brown hair was braided into numerous small braids. He had drooping eyes and a flat nose, and his appearance was strange. Moreover, there was a black feathered and golden beaked parrot standing on his left shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman wore a luxurious robe with a golden bottom and silver lining. Her hair was snow white and had a row of violet plantain lilies on it, and her entire body was covered in beautiful accessories, causing her to seem dignified and graceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter if it was the green robed old man or the white haired old woman, both of their bodies were coiled with strands of Immortal Energy, and it transformed into the energy of the Laws that rose thickly from their bodies. They possessed vast divine might and an extremely frightening imposing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were both men and women amongst the group of people behind them. There was a total of over 10 of them, all of them carried a restrained glow, and possessed great imposing auras. They stood there arrogantly with their arms crossed before their chests, and their expressions were filled with indifference, coldness, and pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their group obstructed the entrance to the hall like a wall that lay across it, and they completely sealed off Fu Yun and everyone else in the hall’s path of retreat.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the empty ground between their two sides was an hourglass that had been turned upside down, and strands of dreamlike and illusory seven colored sand flowed within it, adding a wisp of strange color to this deathly silent atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Elder Fu Yun’s eyes stared fixedly at the hourglass on the ground. Along with the passage of time, his heart grew heavier and heavier, and it was on the verge of falling to rock bottom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people had suddenly trespassed into the hall at dusk, and bluntly locked down this place. They seemed to be domineering and unreasonable, and they even wanted Elder Fu Yun and the others to submit themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the time they were given to consider it was only the time for an incense stick to burn!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What should we do?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Fu Yun’s mind was in chaos, and thoughts flew through his mind while he madly thought about methods to escape this situation, yet he came up empty handed in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple, they were too formidable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the moment they entered the hall, Fu Yun had discerned with a single glance that the cultivation of the green robed old man and white haired old woman was extremely terrifying. Their entire bodies were coiled by the energy of the Laws, and they were absolutely formidable figures at the Heavenly Immortal Realm or above!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, all the men and women by their sides were extremely formidable, and any one of them was capable of easily defeating Fu Yun in a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Fu Yun dare hold any hope when facing such a terrifying force?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what he wondered about was where exactly had these fellows come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, the Dark Reverie was in chaos. The ten great immortal sects and six lineages of the devil sects were busy with their own affairs, so it was impossible for them so send out such a force to the Nine Radiance Sword Sect to cause trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention it was probably impossible for them to send out such a group even if they wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the old man and old woman in the lead weren’t forsakers of the heavens, they were real existences at the Heavenly Immortal Realm or above!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that they descended from the Immortal Dimension?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, Fu Yun’s heart jerked while his scalp felt numb, and he recalled an event of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some time ago, the forces of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in the Immortal Dimension had descended to the Dark Reverie, and they were led by two Heavenly Immortals, Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia. They’d received the grand treatment from the Sect Master and all the higher-ups of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the nephew of Mei Luoxiao had offended a maidservant of Elder Chen Xi’s, and the outcome was that he was bashed up. Moreover, even Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia were unable to escape, and they were heavily on the spot and left in an extremely sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From that day onward, Mei Luoxiao and the others that came from the Immortal Dimension seemed to have evaporated into thin air, and there was no trace of them ever again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was later on that Fu Yun heard from an elder amongst the higher-ups that Mei Luoxiao and the others hadn’t descended to the Mortal Dimension for the sake of assisting the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in dealing with the current calamity. They had other interests instead, and they perished within the Bloodsoul Sword Cave in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the forces of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect in the Immortal Dimension, it had fallen apart and was annihilated by the enemies of the sect a long time ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since this matter was too severe, news of it had been locked down a long time ago, and only some higher-ups of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect were aware of it. If it wasn’t for Fu Yun being familiar with one of the elders amongst the higher-ups, it would be utterly impossible for him to be aware about all of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this that Fu Yun couldn’t help but be slightly suspicious. He felt that these mysterious and terrifyingly formidable fellows might have come from the same power in the Immortal Dimension as Mei Luoxiao and Yu Zhongxia had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it’s really like this, then I’m afraid…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Fu Yun’s heart was icy cold, and he didn’t dare think any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh! There’s still an eighth of an hour left. Have all of you pitiable worms made a decision yet? I’m already on the fucking verge of being unable to restrain my desire for blood.” Meanwhile, the black feathered and gold beaked parrot on the green robed old man’s shoulder suddenly let out a strange cry, and its voice was sharp and pierced &nbsp;the eardrums of all that heard it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damnable feathered beast! We’ll never submit!” When he saw a parrot dared to be so arrogant, a disciple of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect was unable to restrain his rage any longer, and he shouted with a grim voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually dared to fucking insult me!? You’re courting death!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The parrot’s voice had just sounded out when it had already transformed into a strand of black light that vanished on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before everyone could react to what had happened, they heard a swish sound out, and a bloody hole that had already been opened up on the chest of that disciple that shouted loudly earlier!</span></p>

It can’t compare to the heart of a Heavenly Immortal at all.” At the same time, the parrot was already standing on the old man’s shoulder once more, and his golden and sharp beak was holding a bloody heart before he swallowed it completely with a single gulp.</span></p>

You actually killed my younger brother, I’ll fight you to the death!” A disciple’s face warped from rage, and he roared loudly.</span></p>

Earlier, they were already prepared to rescue that disciple, yet never had they imagined that Chen An was actually able to accomplish it before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right after that, they couldn’t be bothered about all of this as they hurriedly protected Chen An so as to avoid that parrot launching another attack.</span></p>

He waved his hand to call the black feathered parrot back before his gaze descended onto Chen An, and then bright lights surged within his eyes as a wisp of surprise suffused them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re only at the perfection-stage of the Rebirth Realm, yet you were able to see through Inkplume’s killing intent and react. You’re really not bad, little fellow. Why don’t you follow by my side and be an attendant disciple of mine?” The green robed old man stroked his chin as he spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as these words were spoken, it instantly caused Fu Yun and the others to become nervous because Chen An was the son of Elder Chen Xi, and even if they gave up their lives, they would absolutely not hand him over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the old woman with snow white hair who was covered in beautiful accessories opened up, and they were suffused with a golden glow. She sized up Chen An from top to bottom before she spoke with surprise. “Zhu Yunsou, this little kid isn’t bad indeed. His natural endowment is superb, his body is pure, and there’s an aura of wisdom contained between his brows. Such natural talent is one in a million, so why don’t you give him to me to be my disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Granny Fei Jiu, don’t even dream about it.” Zu Yunsou grunted coldly before he looked at Chen An and said coldly, “Little Fellow, did you hear what I said? If you follow by my side, I guarantee that you’ll move up rapidly on the road to success and obtain everything you dreamt of!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An puckered his lips and kept silent. Even though his countenance was terribly pale, yet there was still a firm and determined expression present between his brows. At this moment, he was extremely like his father, Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a stubborn little fellow! But since I’ve taken a fancy to you, then it’s an extremely great fortune of yours. Since you actually dared to refuse, then it looks like I can only use force. I’ll let you taste my ability first, and I believe you’ll give in after that!” Zhu Yunsou’s face sank. With a flip of his palm, a strand of black colored flames appeared, and it emanated horrifying energy of the Laws. As soon as it appeared, it caused everyone in the hall to feel suffocated and feel their lives threatened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had expected that Zhu Yunsou would actually make a move on a whim!</span></p>

At the same time, an oppressive wave of air swept in like a storm.</span></p>
