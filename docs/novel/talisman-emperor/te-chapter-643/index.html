It was like a hurricane that instantly stretched out 5,000km in the surroundings, and it stretched throughout the entire ancient Icesky City.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fluctuation was too invasive. It was like the intent of a god had swept past their bodies, causing even their souls to feel a trace of horror and tremble, and no matter their cultivation, no one was an exception!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a terrifying fluctuation. It’s simply more terrifying than the Immortal Sense possessed by a Heavenly Immortal!” Someone spoke with surprise and bewilderment.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, this wouldn’t have been the sign that the Dark Parasol’s Abyss is about to emerge, right?</span></p>

Now, at the instant they noticed this fluctuation and aura that shook the heavens, they unconsciously felt that this fluctuation was most probably related to the Dark Parasol’s Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a small group of people with extremely acute Divine Senses faintly noticed that this fluctuation seemed to have stretched out from the Icesoul Divine Tree. But when they searched it carefully, they didn’t notice anything unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Strange. I clearly sensed that fluctuation from before was emitted by the Icesoul Divine Tree. Why has it vanished in an instant?” Within the pavilion at the highest floor of the Ice Cloud Pavilion, the top experts of the various powers had already filled this place a long time ago. Moreover, this place was only a step away from the Icesoul Divine Tree, so the fluctuation had been acutely noticed by most of them at the instant it was emitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Icesoul Divine Tree emitted the tune of the Grand Dao a few days ago, and it allowed all of us to find out about the news that the Dark Parasol’s Abyss was about to emerge. Now, it suddenly emanated a strange fluctuation, so could it be that it’s really a sign of the emergence of the Dark Parasol’s Abyss?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it’s like this, then we have to make preparations.”</span></p>

Make preparations? It’s useless if you don’t have sufficient strength!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

His entire mind was gathered within his body, and he didn’t have time to bother about anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, even a little child would be able to kill him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant the fluctuation vanished, a piece of charred wood that was palm sized, completely black, and faintly covered in traces of cracks has silently appeared within the Blackhole World in his body and rooted itself at the center of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely an instant, his Blackhole World suddenly emitted a wave of rumbling, and it seemed as if it had awakened from a deep slumber and aroused an extremely violent fluctuation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the influence of this fluctuation, his Blackhole World started circulating madly, and its size actually instantly expanded by more than double, causing it to become even more solid and vast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most shocking of it all was the piece of charred wood actually transformed into an ancient tree with twisted roots and coiled branches that seemed like blades. It seemed to be firm, unyielding, ancient, and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But its branches were completely bald with only a verdant and tender shoot standing proudly on one of the branches, and it glowed with hazy green brilliance and seemed to be extremely striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the green brilliance emitted from the shoot seemed to be inconspicuous like a misty drizzle, yet as soon as it drifted down, it instantly transformed into extremely abundant and vast Immortal Energy that spread throughout the entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly, it was Immortal Energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was able to clearly sense that along with this Immortal Energy surging into the world, the quality of his entire Blackhole World was undergoing a tremendous change at an extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stars, moon, sun, mountains, rivers, seas, lakes, plants… Everything within his Blackhole World seemed to have been bestowed with extremely surging vitality, and they were breathing, cheering, and growing strong and healthily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Blackhole World was said to be a fort made from enormous rocks in the past, then it was a city made from steel now. Not only was it even vaster and more solid than before, but the True Essence it contained was also more than double!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, so long at Chen Xi grasped a Grand Dao profundity at the Perfection Realm now, then he would utterly not need to continue cultivating before being able to bring forth two times his combat strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, all these changes merely occurred in the time for a few breaths, and even Chen Xi almost didn’t dare believe all of this, because it was like a miracle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The intelligence of this strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul has already been completely annihilated by me. In the future, unless you attain a combat strength of 10 times or more, you’ll have no need of relying on spirit pills to cultivate and battle.” The tiny cauldron’s voice suddenly resounded out within his heart. “Moreover, this strand of soul has fused with your Blackhole World, and it will make your cultivation become much easier. After you advance to the Earthly Immortal Realm, it will even bring enormous and unforeseen benefits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was already shocked to speechlessness since a long time ago, and he was dazed after he heard what the tiny cauldron said.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dark Parasol Divine Tree is worthy of being the bridge that connected the Mortal Dimension and Immortal Dimension in the primeval times. Merely a strand of its soul possesses such heaven defying and terrifying effects, and it’s simply unimaginable and astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through the introduction the tiny cauldron gave him, he understood that this sapling of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree was able to give him two types of benefits. The first was that it would ceaselessly replenish his True Essence, causing him to have no need to worry about his True Essence drying up. The second was that it would make his path of cultivation become much easier, smoother, and safer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was merely because his cultivation was too low, and he was unable to realize even more benefits it provided!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps only when he attained the Earthly Immortal Realm would he be able to obtain even more enormous and unimaginable benefits from the sapling of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree like the tiny cauldron had said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Chen Xi felt apprehensive in his heart because he realized a problem. The tiny cauldron seemed to have spoken calmly and without the slightest emotion as usual, but it obviously carried a slightly weak feeling.</span></p>

He understood that the tiny cauldron had surely exhausted an enormous amount of strength and effort to obtain this strand of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree’s soul, otherwise it would absolutely not become so weak.</span></p>

This is only a trade, and it’s fine so long as you find a Chaotic Divine Crystal for me.” The tiny cauldron was silent for a long time before replying.</span></p>

But in the end, he endured this impulse. Since the tiny cauldron had already paid such a price to help him obtain this precious treasure of the heavens and the earth, he would be too useless and ungrateful if he was even unable to obtain a Chaotic Divine Crystal!</span></p>

It was said to be the place of residence of the gods of the primeval times, and it was a true divine mountain.

It was formed from the Dark Parasol Divine Tree that connected the Immortal Dimension and the Mortal Dimension during the primeval times.</span></p>
