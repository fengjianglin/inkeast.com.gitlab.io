He’d seized their belongings, yet still dared to boldly be ruthless towards them, and they felt Chen Xi was simply lawless!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though they were furious, Lie Feng and the others didn’t dare dally in the slightest when facing this resolute attack of Chen Xi’s, and all of them executed their ultimate moves without the slightest hesitation b</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ecause all of them knew how formidable the might of the sacred weapon of their clan was. All of those years ago, it had once drunk the blood of a saint!</span></p>

At the instant it appeared, it charged into the nine heavens and dyed the world red.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dense and surging bloody killing intent almost desired to slaughter the gods and destroy the heavens!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In only an instant, the attacks of Lie Feng and the others were easily dispersed, and if it wasn’t for them dodging quickly, merely this attack would have almost taken their lives. It shocked them to the point their faces suddenly went pale, and they were extremely astounded.</span></p>

Especially when it was executed through the sacred weapon of their Yazi Clan. It was simply like a perfect pairing that was capable of erupting with an even stronger might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow is actually a formidable sword cultivator!” Lie Feng was horrified. He knew that it was impossible for just the forces of the Yazi Clan to be a match for Chen Xi without the assistance of the other powers.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So before Chen Xi could make a move once again, he’d already turned around and left, and he intended to mix into the group before making a move based on the situation.</span></p>

Especially when he was deeply aware of how vengeful these experts of the Yazi Clan were. Once they were allowed to escape, then it would absolutely lead to boundless future troubles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The might of this sacred weapon from the Yazi Clan was formidable indeed, and it far surpassed a Quasi Immortal Artifact. Besides its lack of an Artifact Spirit, it was sufficient for it to be comparable with a real Immortal Artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, when it was utilized by Chen Xi with the profundities of the Slaughter Grand Dao, he was instantly like a god of blood that had descended to the world. A bloody glow that covered the sky shot out horizontally, and not only did it slash Lie Feng and the others apart from the waist, but even the other nearby experts were also affected by it, causing no less than 10 plus people to perish. A rain of blood exploded out and trickled to the ground, and the scene was bloody and horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was instantly shocked as their hearts thumped madly. It was too terrifying!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the battle began until now, Chen Xi practically swept through every obstacle before him and had never encountered any obstruction. He seemed to possess the imposing aura of sweeping through all obstacles and killing everyone before him, he was formidable to the extreme!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts that were charging forward couldn’t help but stop as they gulped down a mouthful of saliva with difficulty, and they hesitated about whether they should turn around and run so that they could avoid being moths that fluttered into the fire and fall to the same horrifying end as those others.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, an empty space was actually created around Chen Xi, and no one dared to move forward anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow is simply too shocking!” Long Zhenbei couldn’t help but swing his fist fiercely and be extremely excited. He was similarly shocked by Chen Xi’s terrifying strength, but it was mostly excitement that he felt because he was like a person facing a hopeless situation that had suddenly seen hope, and he felt indescribably excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed. His strength has become stronger by at least a few times when compared to his strength while going against Wang Zhonghuan!” An Wei’s clear eyes spun as she looked at the figure in midair that was bathed in blood and was immovable in battle like a god of devils, and her eyes were suffused with ripples of extraordinary splendor. She could be said to be the only person present that had witnessed Chen Xi’s mighty rise, and it was precisely because of this that the shock in her heart was even more intense than the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, Chen Xi had revealed a bearing that was different from the others when he joined the Nine Radiance Sword Sect. Every single person didn’t look favorably upon him, yet he would always create shocking miracles.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if nothing in this world could obstruct his footsteps, and everything could only become his stepping stones that allowed him to go higher and further!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s make a move as well. Chen Xi is already fighting for us, so how can we not respond?” Long Zhenbei’s gaze was like bolts of lightning as boundless battle intent surged in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t a weakling, nor was he a pitiable person that would wait for death helplessly. Conversely, he’d grasped the ability to multiply his combat strength by five times, and he was only a step away from six times combat strength. Amongst everyone present here, those that were capable of worrying him could be counted on a single hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” An Wei nodded as a murderous expression appeared on her clear and beautiful face because she’d already been feeling impatient since a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wouldn’t it be better to just watch silently? Why interfere?” Right at the instant both of them wanted to make a move, Yan Shisan who sat cross-legged with his eyes closed on a rock at the side and seemed to be unconcerned with everything in the surroundings had suddenly opened his eyes, and blazing flames actually surged within his eyes like two roiling seas of flames, causing it to be an extremely shocking sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gestured with his hand as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Metallic bangs resounded out as eight large flags that surged with the glow of flames flew up and pierced fiercely into the surrounding ground, and then it instantly formed into a profound Entrapment Formation that trapped Long Zhenbei and An Wei within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Eight Illusion Immortal Cage that’s formed from eight Quasi Immortal Artifacts. Even Earthly Immortal Realm experts would find it difficult to escape this formation. Both of you can relax and wait within. Since we’re all disciples from the 10 great immortal sects, I won’t make it difficult for the two of you.” Yan Shisan spoke indifferently before closing his eyes once more after he finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the beginning until the end, he didn’t give An Wei and Long Zhenbei the opportunity to speak, and his calm voice carried a peerless overbearingness and arrogance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he was really formidable because he was actually capable of casually trapping Long Zhenbei and An Wei together, and he didn’t even give them the chance to react. Thus, his strength was obvious from this!</span></p>

Never had both of them imagined that this renowned madman of the Heavenflow Dao Sect, Yan Shisan, would actually be more formidable than the rumors said.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing that allowed them to be at ease was that Yan Shisan didn’t have any intention of making things difficult for them. Moreover, he only trapped them within a formation and didn’t arouse the intention to kill&nbsp;b</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ut both of them became worried for Chen Xi once again. With an extremely terrifying fellow like Yan Shisan glaring with hostility from the side, Chen Xi was probably in danger…</span></p>

Conversely, he started to take the initiative to attack.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He held the sacred weapon of the Yazi Clan, the bloody sword, in his hand while moving with the Chaotic Nine-Steps Annihilation, and coupled with the movement speed of the Wings of Disruption that was swift like a bolt of lightning, it caused him to seem like a Fiendgod that wandered about within space while slaughtering living beings and coloring the sky red.</span></p>

Since the battle started until now, this thief has already exhausted an enormous amount of physical strength, and we must not allow him to replenish his True Essence. Otherwise, all the hard work from before would be in vain!” Feng Jianbai shouted at the top of his voice.</span></p>

But when he saw the entire crowd of experts faintly showed sights of retreating and fleeing in defeat, he was instantly unable to sit still, and he started to roar continuously and boost the morale of everyone.</span></p>

A mere few sentences of his had quickly calmed the minds of those experts.</span></p>

So long as he’s pressured to the point of being unable to consume spirit pills to replenish his True Essence, then wouldn’t he be exhausted to death in the end?</span></p>

No matter how formidable Chen Xi was, he was only at the Nether Transformation Realm, and he’d surely exhausted an enormous amount of True Essence already. If they were to give up at this moment, it would be a great pity indeed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they thought up to here, those experts that originally intended to flee, didn’t flee any longer, and those that hadn’t made a move yet decided to seize this opportunity to make a move, causing the situation to return to what it was before this.</span></p>

All of them seethed with killing intent and had excited expression, and it seemed as if Chen Xi was about to perish and those Grand Dao Fragments would be within easy reach as well.</span></p>

These words were really a true saying that’s indisputable since ancient times, and it was accurate anywhere in the world.</span></p>

Moreover, all these experts that had died miserably were absolutely not ordinary figures. All of them were great cultivators at the Nether Transformation Realm, and their strength was sufficient to establish a sect in the outside world. How could such a shocking sacrifice have not caused any consumption to Chen Xi?</span></p>
