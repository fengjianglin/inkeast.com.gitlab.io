 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Violet Ribbon Starcrest, a crest unique to Dao Emperor Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was aware that no one was capable of making a copy of this crest, and only students of Dao Emperor Academy could wear one. This was a symbol of their identity, and it represented the dignity of Dao Emperor Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, the Violet Ribbon Starcrest had numerous miraculous effects, and one would only be clearly aware of them after becoming a true student of Dao Emperor Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the experts that possessed the qualifications to participate in Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment test actually participated in the test, they similarly had to wear this crest, and the crest of those who were eliminated would be taken away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just Dao Emperor Academy, all the six great academies of the Immortal Dimension had their own unique crest, and it was provided to be adorned by the students of their respective academies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’re Starpoints?” Chen Xi couldn’t help but ask curiously after noticing the words on his Violet Ribbon Starcrest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Something similar to contribution points in a sect. After you enter Dao Emperor Academy, everything from attending classes, training, obtaining cultivation techniques or medicinal pills, and even requesting the help of others will require Starpoints. You’ll naturally understand how important it is after you enter Dao Emperor Academy.” Tie Qiuyu replied in a brief manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi instantly came to an understanding, and he said in his heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looks like I can’t sit back and enjoy the resources of Dao Emperor Academy upon entering it, and I have to work hard to strive for everything. But this is good as well because only with competition is there improvement. A place that’s too easy and comfortable would easily wear down my will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they spoke, a wave of footsteps resounded from the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Man Tie, guess what I saw! Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu actually came out from Iris Continent’s Martial Soul Hall!” Accompanying this voice was a tall and thin white clothed young man that walked in with swift strides. He still intended to say something, yet he instantly changed what he was about to say upon noticing Chen Xi at the side, and he smiled with surprise. “Chen Xi, you’ve come.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi stood up and cupped his hands as he said, “Big Brother Gu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tall and thin white clothed young man before him was exactly Gu Yueming, Gu Yutang’s older brother. At the same time, he was the expert ranked at the second position on Southbridge Continent’s Continental Ascensio Rankings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming cupped his hands and smiled as he said, “There’s no need for all that. You’re friends with Yutang, so you’re naturally no outsider. Sit down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded and sat down once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nearby Tie Qiuyu’s expression was slightly gloomy instead, and he frowned as he looked at Gu Yueming and said, “Was what you just said true?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming didn’t hesitate to answer. “How could it be false? I saw it with my own two eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu’s brows knit together even more tightly, and then he muttered. “How did these two fellows get together with the Zuoqiu Clan? An ancient clan like that isn’t related to them at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming smiled as he sighed with emotion. “This is called fortune. Perhaps the Zuoqiu Clan took a liking to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, he was rather envious towards their ability to form a relationship with the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right after that, Gu Yueming noticed that Tie Qiuyu’s expression was slightly off, and he pondered briefly before he instantly had a wisp of faint understanding and shot his gaze towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu had formed a relationship with the Zuoqiu Clan, then they would surely go against Chen Xi during the second round of Dao Emperor Academy’s test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, even if he, Gu Yueming, and Liang Ren were to stand by Chen Xi’s side, Chen Xi would still be in an extremely bad situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason Tie Qiuyu had a gloomy expression was none other than because he guessed that this sort of change would easily arouse internal strife amongst these disciples of Southbridge Continent, and the effect of this was terrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi clearly understood their thoughts as well, and he smiled. “You’re right, but they didn’t get together by fortune, and it was the Zuoqiu Clan that took the initiative to seek them out instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu and Gu Yueming were surprised when they heard this, and they said in unison, “Why?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, why would an authoritative power in the Immortal Dimension like the Zuoqiu Clan take the initiative to get together with Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu? If it wasn’t Chen Xi who said this, they would definitely sneer at it and wouldn’t even be bothered to inquire about the reason because it was very obvious that this seemed to overly elevate the existence of Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s expression became calm as he said, “Because the Zuoqiu Clan is racking its brains to figure out how to deal with me, and they know that there’s enmity between me and Yin Miaomiao, so they would naturally use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu was shocked. “Is this true?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming looked at Chen Xi as if he was looking at a freak as well. He was truly unable to imagine how Chen Xi had offended a top colossus in the Immortal Dimension like the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere became slightly strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi laughed bitterly and shrugged as he said, “This isn’t anything good, so is there any reason for me to joke about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu and Gu Yueming glanced at each other, and the shock on their faces was impossible to eliminate in a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering deeply for a long time, Tie Qiuyu shook his head and sighed. “This is going to be even more troublesome. Since the Zuoqiu Clan is targeting you like this, then they’ll probably intentionally go against you and play some tricks during the second round of the test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming grunted coldly and said, “It’s not something that’ll probably happen, they’ll definitely go against Chen Xi. Originally, I thought Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu very fortunate to make friends with the Zuoqiu Clan, but it turns out that they’re acting as lackeys for the Zuoqiu Clan. They’re truly shameless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice hadn’t finished resounding through the air when a wave of footsteps resounded from outside the hall, and then Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu walked in together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going to rest.” Gu Yueming grunted once more when he saw them, and then he directly stood up and left. He seemed to be unwilling to be associated with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao was indifferent towards this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu frowned instead and said, “He only knows how to talk behind other’s back. I wonder who’s the really shameless one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice wasn’t loud, yet the distant Gu Yueming heard it clearly. He suddenly turned around and stared coldly at Jiang Zhuliu as he said, “I just couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to you. Could it be that you really think I don’t dare to insult you to your face? Being of poor birth isn’t your fault, but being filled with arrogance after grabbing onto the Yin Clan is. Do you really think you’re some sort of great figure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu’s face turned grim because his greatest taboo was people talking about his background. Earlier, he’d already suffered disregard from Zuoqiu Ke, and it caused him to be filled with pent-up rage. At this moment, when he saw Gu Yueming dared to ridicule him to his face as well, it caused him to lose his compose, and he immediately said with an icy cold voice, “There’s naturally a fair judgment about what sort of figure I am. However, you, Gu Yueming, are ranked lower than me yet dare to talk nonsense before me? Who the fuck do you think you are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere was confrontational and explosive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming’s face sank as well, and he was just about to speak when he was interrupted by Tie Qiuyu who said, “Enough! If I wasn’t your guide, I couldn’t be fucking bothered to care about the crap between all of you! Now, if you don’t wish for you qualifications to be stripped away, then all of you shut the fuck up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was like thunder that exploded in the hall, and he didn’t conceal his rage in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present was apprehensive in their hearts, and they didn’t dare speak any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Yueming grunted coldly, and then he glanced at Jiang Zhuliu before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu had a bellyful of grievance with nowhere to vent it. When he saw Chen Xi who sat at the side, he became steady instead, and he sat before the table and looked at Chen Xi as he said, “If I’m not wrong, you ascended from the Mortal Dimension, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi didn’t even spare him a glance as he directly stood up, and then he said to Tie Qiuyu, “Senior, if there’s nothing else, then I’ll be heading back to meditate first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Chen Xi turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu’s face sank when he saw Chen Xi actually dared to disregard him, and he said, “Earlier, Gu Yueming said that I’m of poor birth, and he was embarrassed to be associated with me. But I’m from the Immortal Dimension after all. Comparatively speaking, it’s the greatest joke that he’s friends with an ascender from the Mortal Dimension like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s footsteps were steady, and they weren’t stiff in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Zhuliu couldn’t be bothered to conceal it any longer when he saw this, and he ridiculed bluntly. “Remember, no matter how terrible my birth is, it’s much more superior to yours. Do you think you could have survived until now without the Liang Clan’s protection?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, I obtained the support of the Yin Clan, but Miss Miaomiao has already agreed to be united as Dao Companions with me. Now, even the Zuoqiu Clan treats us specially. What qualifications do you have to compete with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more he spoke, the more agitated he became. He seemed as if he wanted to completely vent the resentment and rage in his heart, but his target had become Chen Xi instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Besides that, after I pass Dao Emperor Academy’s test this time, I, Jiang Zhuliu, will be a student of Dao Emperor Academy! Merely based on this identity, I’m someone that none of you can disrespect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up until the point Chen Xi’s figure vanished, Chen Xi didn’t speak a single word nor reveal any emotion. This sort of silent disregard caused Jiang Zhuliu’s expression to become livid, and he gnashed his teeth and said, “You’ll regret this! All of you will regret this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed as if he shouted out the final sentence he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Yin Miaomiao that stood silently at the side couldn’t help but frown as she felt Jiang Zhuliu had lost his composure, yet she didn’t say anything in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven days later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At dawn, the azure sky above was lit up by clear light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entirety of Darkombat City had become extremely bustling before the sky had lit up completely. The streets were bustling with streams of people and wagons that surged like a tide, and all of them were rushing towards the inner city of Darkombat City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous variant beasts soared through the sky while crying and drifting through rosy clouds. The resplendent and blazing auspicious qi and glow emitted by their treasures made the entire sky seem gorgeous, dazzling, and extraordinarily grand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this was because Dao Emperor Academy would begin the recruitment test today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a grand event that could stir the three dimensions and draw countless experts over from all over. It wasn’t just the Immortal Dimension, there was also the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, Phoenix Clan, and various other mysterious domains. It could be said that a storm had gathered here, and it was a gathering of experts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This grand event was held every hundred years, and there were top experts of the younger generation that obtained a meteoric rise and became renowned in the world through this grand event every single time it was held!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, the Flaming Rain Ling Qingwu, the Iron Abyss Ye Tang, and the Jade Phoenix Wan Jiansheng who were part of the six blazing suns had advanced into the Golden Immortal Realm, attained the supreme position as one of the blazing suns, and become the center of the three dimension’s attention while in Dao Emperor Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one traced back the past, then the great figures that were born in Dao Emperor Academy were countless and magnificent like a river of stars. The most renowned of them all was the current Valiant Star Immortal King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this caused Dao Emperor Academy’s recruitment ceremony to be extremely grand every single time, and it was unprecedentedly spectacular. It was the most striking event in the three dimensions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At dawn on this day, Chen Xi followed behind Tie Qiuyu and stepped onto the path to participate in Dao Emperor Academy’s test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart was calm, yet it was impossible to conceal his excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because this test was related to whether he would be able to truly gain a foothold in the Immortal Dimension!&nbsp;</span></p>
