 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when everyone was astounded, the Grand Dao Fragment had already fallen into Chen Xi’s palm, and it instantly vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! You clearly know you’re going to die for sure, so why bother? Do you think you’re capable of instantly refining and absorbing a Grand Dao Fragment to multiply your strength once more?” Yan Shisan grunted coldly and seemed like a god of devils as flaming rays of light curled up as his eyes blinked, causing him to emanate an oppressive aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi wiped off the blood on the corners of his mouth and puckered his lips without saying anything. Within his body, he was circulating his Blackhole World madly while relying on the might of the Dark Parasol sapling to start refining and absorbing this Grand Dao Fragment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shisan was really terrifyingly formidable, possessed extraordinary natural talent, and possessed numerous Dao Arts and magic treasures that shook the heavens and the earth. Moreover, he possessed the ability to multiply his combat strength by seven times. Amongst those of the same generation, it was practically impossible for him to find a match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When faced with a freak that was like an inborn saint, Chen Xi knew extremely clearly that perhaps he was capable of throwing other Nether Transformation Realm cultivators into disorder and defeating them with his five times combat strength, but when compared to Yan Shisan, he was obviously a bit inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, no matter if it was Dao Arts, magic treasures, strength, and combat experience, Yan Shisan was already amongst the top ranks of those in the same generation, and it caused Chen Xi to be unable to gain any advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, he was able to rely on the might of the Dark Parasol sapling to let the fight drag on until Yan Shisan was exhausted and forcefully exhaust Yan Shisan to death. But, unfortunately, because of the tiny cauldron suddenly speaking a moment ago, it had caused a slight flaw to appear in his mind, and it was instantly grabbed by Yan Shisan without letting off, causing him to fall into a disadvantaged position right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, one wrong move and the whole game could be lost. Under these adverse circumstances, he required a great breakthrough in order to turn the situation around, whereas that Grand Dao Fragment that had emerged into the world had become Chen Xi’s one and only choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Give up! Even if the Grand Dao Fragment has fallen into your hands, it will still belong to me once I kill you in the end. You’re just wasting your energy!” Yan Shisan roared like a thunderclap that shook the surroundings, and it was filled with an arrogant and overbearing tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, he’d flashed out with his hand carried a myriad of flaming glows, and it was like a sea of flames descending from the sky. Such an attack was absolutely capable of obliterating a city and destroying countless armies, yet it was used to deal with a single person now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of everyone turned to shock as they’d sensed Yan Shisan’s resolution to kill Chen Xi from this strike, and it caused their bodies to tense up uncontrollably as they stared fixedly at the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His life is hanging by a thread, will Chen Xi be killed just like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts of An Wei and Long Zhen Bei had even risen to their throats as they revealed despaired and dejected expressions. If Chen Xi were to die, then even if they were able to survive, they would be unable to be at ease for their entire lifetimes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

It was like the sun and moon had collided, and it resounded out in the nine heavens while surging with an extremely blazing glow that drowned out the entire sky and caused every single person to be unable to see the scene in the sky clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Has Chen Xi died?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stared with their eyes wide open, yet were utterly incapable of seeing everything clearly, and their eyes were pierced by the blazing rays of light to the point of aching and being on the verge of flowing with tears instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s probably dead. Even if he obtained that Grand Dao Fragment, it’s impossible for Chen Xi to turn the situation around in this critical situation of life and death. After all, it’s absolutely impossible to completely refine and absorb a Grand Dao Fragment within an instant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, actually when you think about it, if it wasn’t for him repeatedly plundering our Grand Dao Fragments and incurred public indignation, it would be unlikely for such a genius figure to fall to such an end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our? Haha, truly laughable! The Grand Dao Fragments were things without owners, so what crime has Chen Xi committed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, this kid has been killed in the end…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone whispered in discussion with various different expressions. Some carried admiration, regret, pity, excitement, delight, and wished for nothing more than to dance with joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these discussions weren’t inferior to thunderclaps when they entered into the ears of Long Zhenbei and An Wei, and it caused their expressions to turn gloomy, their eyes to lose color, their hearts to feel dejected and ache as if it was being minced apart, and they felt it was difficult to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s dead?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, everyone seemed as if they were struck by lightning when they saw this figure, and they almost didn’t dare believe their eyes. That figure was actually Yan Shisan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strand of scarlet red blood flowed out from the corners of his mouth, and even though it vanished instantly, it was still clearly noticed by everyone present in the surroundings. In other words, he’d actually been injured?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time that Yan Shisan was injured since the battle began! Originally, everyone thought that Chen Xi would die for sure, yet never had they imagined that such a turn in the situation would occur?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stupefied like wooden puppets and didn’t understand exactly what had happened.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi didn’t die, and he’d injured Yan Shisan in this critical moment instead!</span></p>

After all, since they’d started cultivating until now, they’d never lost their composure as they had at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious from this that this scene had brought enormous pleasant surprise and joy to them.</span></p>

You were actually able to endure for so long before bringing forth your entire strength at this moment!” Yan Shisan’s eyes turned icy cold and flickered with surging flames, as he’d already become truly infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t think that Chen Xi was capable of completely refining and absorbing the Grand Dao Fragment in an instant, so he felt that Chen Xi had always been concealing his strength since the beginning of the battle!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi avoided it. At this moment, his entire body emanated boundless radiance and was suffused with a terrifying aura that was more than two times more formidable than before, and he went head on with Yan Shisan ferociously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he’d relied on the might of the Dark Parasol sapling to instantly refine and absorb the Grand Dao Fragment, and he’d already possessed the ability to multiply his combat strength by six times, causing his strength to be incomparable to before.</span></p>

Exactly how enormous would the strength needed to accomplish this be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this cauldron was a Quasi Immortal Artifact with peerless might, and it was called the Suncrow World Cauldron. It was a precious treasure that Yan Shisan had searched for bitterly, and it was far from something ordinary Quasi Immortal Artifacts could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, it was actually struck to the point of sinking in by a single strike from Chen Xi. This divine might couldn’t help but shock everyone present, and even Yan Shisan himself was visibly moved.</span></p>

Very good!” Yan Shisan roared repeatedly and seemed to be furious to the extreme. His eyes were crimson red and surging with the glow of flames, and he’d already gone completely mad, causing his peerless imposing manner to seem as if it belonged to a great god of demons while he charged towards Chen Xi while coiled by divine flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi remained silent and was composed. Every single action of his executed a thousand skills and a myriad of profound techniques, and he was like a sovereign that had descended to the world to guide it and possessed boundless might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, both of them collided once again, and they carried out a most terrifying battle of life and death.</span></p>

They fought from the heavens right down to the ground, then from the Region of Earth to the entire Dark Parasol Secret Realm before charging once more into the clouds, and then they fought all the way back to the Region of Earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused all the spectators of the battle to be dumbstruck by this scene, and they practically forgot everything because their eyes and hearts were filled with enormous shock and their minds were shaking endlessly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, both Long Zhenbei and An Wei knew that when Chen Xi returned to the sect and with his natural talent, Chen Xi would absolutely surpass all geniuses to be ranked at the peak of the Seed Disciples on Divine Radiance Peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, both of them fought more and more violently, and they fought to the point the heavens and the earth were cast into a shade, the sun and moon dimmed down, and the corners of their mouths flowed with blood. In the end, Yan Shisan’s killing move was obliterated, causing him to be slapped flying by Chen Xi, and it shook him to the point he coughed up blood without end as he flew out through the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not to mention you, even Bing Shitian is unable to obstruct my footsteps!” Chen Xi spoke with an icy cold voice.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi made a move directly. This time, his expression was even more icy-cold and murderous than before, and it was also much calmer. He slapped out with his palm, and it seemed like a myriad of enormous waves were surging out while emitting rumbling and whistling sounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amongst them was the vague scene of numerous mysterious and beautiful Paramita Flowers in full bloom, swaying and emitting a terrifying aura that caused one’s heart to palpitate.</span></p>

If one didn’t obey, then one would surely be suppressed beneath the six paths of reincarnation and the eighteen levels of hell!</span></p>

His entire body was burning like a scorching sun while he himself was trying to dodge it yet it was futile, and he was blasted flying by it.</span></p>

The front of his clothes shattered apart while his chest sunk down, and numerous bones had been blasted apart. If it wasn’t for his formidable strength and swift change to defense, all his internal organs would have been shattered by this attack.</span></p>

Yet he’d actually been defeated!</span></p>

After all, Yan Shisan’s reputation was too great, and he was like the sun in the midday sky within the 10 great immortal sects. So his defeat naturally seemed to be too unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never expected, haha! I truly never expected that I’d actually lose at your hands. But Chen Xi, you shouldn’t get complacent too early, because there are many more people that are much more formidable than I, Yan Shisan, amongst the experts of the same generation in the Dark Reverie. You’re not the only one!” Yan Shisan’s clothes were dyed red with blood while his expression was pale, yet his bearing remained the same as he roared endlessly with laughter while facing the sky.</span></p>
