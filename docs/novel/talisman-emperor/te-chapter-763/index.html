 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the difference in the Temporal Laws, the passage of time in the world of stars was slower by around 10 times. In other words, Chen Xi had already been comprehending silently for 30 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, Chen Xi who sat silently like a withered tree and unmoving like a rock suddenly rumbled with a great tune of the Dao, and it spread out throughout the entire world of stars with great strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the myriad of stars seemed to have received a summons, causing them to emanate countless expanses of chilly starlight that were like numerous silver colored waterfalls that poured down and enveloped Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single inch of his skin, every single pore on his body was bathed in dense and almost material silver radiance. Every single aperture and meridian in his body seemed to have cleared up abruptly, and then it echoed with the myriad of stars above him from afar and produced a type of miraculous and indescribable change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if in this instant, Chen Xi had transformed into the son of the starry sky, and he’d become the ruler of this universe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression was solemn while his aura was vast and profound. Every single breath he took was like the roar of a dragon, and it shook the starry sky and resonated with the heavens and the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When looked at carefully, one would notice that numerous halos were circling around his body, and every single halo was like a scorching sun that emitted numerous perfect auras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These auras were formed from quintessence Grand Dao’s like Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Yin, Yang, Wind, Lightning, and Star that were commanded by the Dao of Talismans! Ten types of Grand Dao had attained to the Perfection Realm, and they’d formed into halos that were round like a full moon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the meridians within his body were inscribed with dense and complicated talisman markings, causing his aura to become even more mysterious, profound, and vast. It seemed as if his body was densely covered with numerous blackholes that carried the aura of devouring everything in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within his Dantian, when compared to before, the Blackhole World constructed from the five Divine Talismans was alternating between day and night, and the star, moon, and sun in the sky formed a circulation and had started to move, whistle, and flicker between brightness and dimness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, during this time of three years in the outside world or 30 years in the world of stars, Chen Xi had attained the Perfection Realm in the Grand Dao profundities of Yin, Yang, and Star!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, besides Paramita, Oblivion, Obliteration, and Eternal, all the other quintessence Dao Insights he possessed had already attained the Perfect Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Sword Dao, Dao of Talismans, and Devour Dao, they were Grand Daos of technique and not quintessence Grand Daos, so their level of comprehension was completely different to quintessence Dao Insights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, the Sword Dao was divided into basic, advanced, unity, perfection, Enlightened Sword Heart, Sword Qi Threads, and so on and so forth. The Dao of Talismans and the Devour Dao were roughly the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In 30 years of time, three Grand Dao profundities had achieved perfection!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this were to be placed in the outside world, it was sufficient to shock the world and astound everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But to Chen Xi who possessed the quintessence energy of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree, this speed of comprehension still seemed to be too slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cause of this was the Star Grand Dao. The quintessence energy of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree possessed the five elements, Yin, Yang, Wind, Lightning, and various other Laws, but it didn’t possess anything related to the Laws of Star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So Chen Xi had relied completely on his comprehension to comprehend the Star Grand Dao and not the quintessence of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree, and it was precisely because of this that he’d exhausted over 20 years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Chen Xi to be shocked as well. When he was young, he’d comprehended the Star Grand Dao through his cultivation of the Universe Starslayer Bodyforging Technique and visualizing the Fuxi Divine Statue. Moreover, coupled with the tempering of the Starsky Wings, Grand Astral Palm, and Stellar Lightningform that were related to the Star Dao Insight, he’d comprehended the Star Grand Dao to Advanced Realm a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he never expected that it would actually be so difficult to attain the Perfection Realm in the Star Grand Dao from the Advanced Realm, and this greatly exceeded his imagination and expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he came to an understanding in next to no time. Even though the Star Grand Dao was rare, it was one of the most mysterious and vast Grand Daos. It was like the Myriad Convergence Sword Scripture, it was very ordinary, yet how many people in the world were capable of completely comprehending and grasping it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the primeval times, the ancient ancestors had utilized the observing of stars to deduce the workings of the heavens, fate, fortune, and calamity. If it was in terms of the most mysterious and vast Grand Dao amongst the 3,000 Grand Daos, then it would surely be the Star Grand Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So Chen Xi could feel proud in himself from being able to completely master it to the Perfection Realm within a little over 20 years of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten Grand Daos at the Perfection Realm also meant that from this moment onward, Chen Xi possessed 10 times combat strength, and he was already a true exalted expert amongst those of the same cultivation!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the ancient times until now, how many people amongst the myriad of living beings and countless geniuses had attained the Exalted Rank?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once one attained this level of cultivation, it was sufficient to sweep through all in the same generation and be invincible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Chen Xi was even more outstanding because the strength he possessed far exceeded cultivators of the same cultivation. Early on when he still possessed six times combat strength, he was already capable of blasting Chen Langya who possessed nine times combat strength back with a flick of his sleeve. Moreover, Chen Langya didn’t have the slightest room to resist, let alone now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could even be said that even if an exalted figure that possessed 11 or 12 times combat strength appeared now, it would be absolutely impossible for that person to be a match for Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the bottom of it all, &nbsp;the Blackhole World constructed from the five Divine Talismans and his ‘extreme’ cultivation contributed greatly to his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi opened his eyes. The sun and moon alternated within his eyes that surged with Talisman Markings, and as his gaze swept out, merely his gaze was capable of causing the surrounding space to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood up with his hands behind his back, and his tall, graceful, and lone figure seemed to be able to tear open the veil of the sky. His clothes fluttered with the wind as he stood proudly beneath the myriad of stars in the sky, and every single move he made carried a dignified aura of control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was like the Emperor of the universe as he stood there, while the myriad of stars were his subjects. This was the vast and mighty aura he possessed &nbsp;as a figure at the Exalted Rank, and it was terrifying and monstrous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He strolled within the starry sky and didn’t continue comprehending the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a small bit of the quintessence energy of the Dark Parasol Divine Tree remained, and he’d refined it into nine Grand Dao Fragments that respectively contained the five elements, Yin, Yang, Lightning, and Wind. He intended to leave it to his senior brothers and senior sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the four types of rare Grand Dao Insights — Paramita, Oblivion, Eternal, and Obliteration, they were too obscure and difficult. Even if he entered into closed door cultivation for over a hundred years, he would probably find it impossible to comprehend them to the Perfection Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three years have passed in the outside world.

The youths of the Violet Lightning and Azurefrost camps were in an intense battle, causing a dense aura of battle and slaughter to effuse out, and it caused others to have the misconception that they were in a battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s still too inferior! Remember, there must be variation! Don’t be restrained by fixed techniques. The situation of a true battlefield changes a myriad of times in an instant, so how will all of you face it then?”</span></p>

All of you are body refiners, so ferociousness is your only advantage!</span></p>

Show them what’s all-powerful might! Show them what’s crushing force! Bring out your imposing auras! All of you only have a single objective on the battlefield, and it’s to slaughter all your enemies! Don’t allow anything to obstruct your footsteps forward!” Qing Yu stood in the distance while shouting in a deep voice. His handsome face was covered in blazing madness, and it caused others to find it impossible to believe that this was a shy and kindhearted youth…</span></p>

Even A’xiu had Bai Kui in her arms while grinning at the side and looking at the distant battle.</span></p>

Pure Swan Lightning Wings, Wind Spirit Light Shoes, Four-Symbol Formation Belt, Hollowed-out Black Gold Bracers… All of them were top-grade earth-rank magic treasures.</span></p>

Moreover, when they fought as a whole, it was capable of forming a connection that was similar to a formation.</span></p>

It wasn’t like a drill, but instead seemed no different to a true battle, yet no one suffered a fatal injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This came from Qing Yu’s formidable power of control. He was controlling and commanding the battle between the two camps by himself. Every time someone was injured, he would swiftly issue the commands to instantly defend the injured. Moreover, the entire situation of the battle was in good order, and it didn’t suffer any effect from this. His extraordinary ability of command caused him to seem like a general that had experienced countless battles.</span></p>

Qing Yu was calm and collected as he issued orders, and only his eyes still carried a wisp of blazing madness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This appearance was something Chen Xi had never seen.</span></p>

Hey! Chen Xi! We’re here.” A’xiu waved her hand from afar and cried out in a clear voice.</span></p>

Only Qing Yu was still staring at the battlefield with a concentrated expression, and he’d become oblivious to everything else in his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi walked over with a smile and said, “After not seeing it for three years, our West Radiance Peak has truly become bustling.”</span></p>

Even though they were busy to the point of utter exhaustion every single day, their hearts were unprecedentedly full.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Wei and Mo Ya weren’t unoccupied either. Both of them had become part of the West Radiance Peak a long time ago. Every day, besides patrolling the entire mountain according to schedule, they would cultivate, and observe the growth and transformation of the youths from their clan, and it caused them to be extremely delighted.</span></p>
