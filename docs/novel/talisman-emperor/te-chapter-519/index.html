 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Ya seemed to have recalled something, causing enormous shock to suddenly arise in his heart, and his gaunt face couldn’t help but twitch fiercely. He opened his mouth to speak, yet he became dejected and speechless in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Successively broke through nine waves of Heavenly Tribulations in a single night to ascend…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi glanced at the nearby Qing Xiuyi with a surprised expression, and he thought in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that it’s just as Yun Lansheng said, and she was a disciple of the Heavenflow Dao Sect in the past?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve only recovered 60% of the memories in my previous life, and all of it only consists of some comprehensions in cultivation. I’m unable to remember anything related to the Heavenflow Dao Sect.” Qing Xiuyi seemed to have seen through the perplexed feeling in Chen Xi’s heart, and she said via voice transmission, “But I do indeed have a familiar feeling when the Heavenflow Dao Sect is mentioned. Nevermind, we’ll wait and see what happens. This Yun Lansheng probably has no ill intent towards us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the distant spectators were all shocked and bewildered in their hearts. After they heard what Yun Lansheng had said, how could they have not guessed that the person he spoke of was Qing Xiuyi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they thought of how this young woman had actually been a disciple of the ancient paradise, the Heavenflow Dao Sect, in her previous life, and she’d even created the miracle of successively breaking through nine waves of Heavenly Tribulations in a single night to ascend, tempestuous storms couldn’t help but arise in the hearts of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly how terrifying would such a figure have been in the past?</span></p>

Take me to go see the disciples of your Darchu Dynasty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This suggestion seemed to be slightly abrupt, yet when he thought about how Yun Lansheng was once from the same sect as Qing Xiuyi and had helped them earlier, Chen Xi couldn’t refuse and nodded right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Chen Xi had agreed, Qing Xiuyi and Zhen Liuqing naturally had no objections.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slap!</span></p>

Ling Ya’s expression was gloomy, and he couldn’t endure the fury in his heart any longer, causing him to fiercely slap Shang Que on the face to the point of being blasted flying directly. Shang Que fell heavily onto the ground and smashed out a large hole in the ground while blood sprayed from his mouth, and even a few of his teeth had fallen out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trash! Each generation is getting worse than the previous! What use are all of you if you can’t even do anything to the disciples of an ordinary Dynasty? All of you deserve death!” When Ancestor Ling Ya recalled the scenes from before, he was angered to the point of being on the verge of exploding, and his expression was livid as his gaze revealed a ferocious light that seemed ready to swallow his enemies up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que was terrified to the point that his entire body trembled, and he held the right side of his face that was swollen and bleeding while feeling aggrieved and resentful in his heart. But he didn’t dare say another word, as he was deeply afraid of infuriating Ancestor Ling Ya to the point of directly annihilating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trash! All of you are trash!” When he saw Shang Que reveal this cowardly appearance, Ancestor Ling Ya was angered to the point of wishing for nothing more than to crush this piece of trash to death, yet he forcefully endured this impulse in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, the Shang Clan had been practically annihilated and only Shang Que remained. If he killed Shang Que as well, then the final test in the Primeval Battlefield this time would have nothing to do with his Shang Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought up to here, the flames of rage in Ancestor Ling Ya’s heart calmed down greatly, and he glanced coldly at Shang Que and asked. “They’re dead, but have you lost the territory?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, no.” When he spoke up to here, he recalled something and gritted his teeth as he said, “Ancestor, if you didn’t arrive in time, the Feng Clan would probably have taken the opportunity of the disturbance to seize our territory. They’re truly detestable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! What’s the point of saying all this now? You can only blame all of yourselves for being failures!” Ancestor Ling Ya grunted in a low voice yet his tone had eased up greatly. It was fine so long as they still had their territory, and it was meaningless to fuss about anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Come with me to drip your blood and take ownership of the Battlevow Tablet. So long as you obtain the acknowledgment of the Battlevow Tablet, then not only will you be able to completely control the northwest area of Primeval City, the most important thing is you’ll be able to obtain a true weapon of the gods after the final test ends!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a true weapon of the gods was mentioned, even with Ancestor Ling Ya’s state of mind, a wisp of a burning expression couldn’t help but gush out from his eyes. However, when he saw the badly battered and frightened Shang Que, he felt furious and conflicted to the extreme, and he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This worthless trash really got lucky this time.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

It was extremely lofty and stood towering while being surrounded by other buildings, and it was like a crane standing amongst chickens, extremely striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huangfu Qingying, Young Master Zhou, Fan Yunlan, Zhao Qinghe, and Ling Yu were standing respectfully within the hall, and they were looking ahead with complicated expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area ahead of them had nine levels of stone stairs distributed there, and they rose up layer by layer, while a central throne sat right above the stairs, allowing one to be able to look down on every corner of the hall while sitting atop the throne.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, during the time the gods of the ancient times were on the expedition, this was absolutely a throne that only a god that possessed an extremely respected status had the qualification to sit on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, there was a dirty geezer lying lazily on the throne. &nbsp;His dirty right hand held a yellow wine gourd while his left hand held a roasted chicken, and he was chowing down on his food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This geezer was thin like a stick, had a goatee, and he emitted the stench of alcohol while his eyes were muddy from his intoxication. He wore a robe that was tattered and dirty to the point it was impossible to discern its original color, and he simply seemed like a beggar from the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He just lay there totally unconcerned, drinking as he ate, and he seemed to be extremely comfortable and satisfied.</span></p>

He doesn’t seem like an expert at all!” Young Master Zhou frowned as he gritted his teeth and sent a voice transmission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s too slovenly indeed, and he’s even more slovenly than my Master.” Zhao Qinghe compared this dirty geezer and his master in his mind, and he actually noticed that his Master could even be described as neatly dressed before this dirty geezer.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Young Master Zhou was pressed down on the ground with a single slap of the dirty geezer, causing him to be unable to stand up no matter what, and this scene instantly shocked the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Young Master Zhou was a Rebirth Realm expert now at any rate, and he was an existence that was ranked in the top 20 of the Warsoul Tablet. However, he was actually slapped down with a single strike to the point of being unable to stand up, so how could they not be shocked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Huangfu Qingying who saw that things weren’t going well and pleaded for mercy from the dirty geezer, and it was only because of this that he let Young Master Zhou off. Thus, this was why Young Master Zhou had a belly full of discontent and indignation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the dirty geezer didn’t have any ill intentions, he just kept repeating that he knew Chen Xi and intended to meet Chen Xi, and he wouldn’t leave until Chen Xi arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused everyone to be surprised. Moreover, Huangfu Qingying noticed that this dirty geezer was extremely weird, he was utterly unlike a cultivator at the Rebirth Realm and was absolutely not like a disciple of the Dynasties that had entered the Primeval Battlefield. However, if he was said to be an emissary, he just happened to have arrived a step earlier than those emissaries, causing him to be completely enshrouded in strangeness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he’d named Chen Xi as the person he wanted to see, and this caused Huangfu Qingying to feel even more bewildered. According to her knowledge, Chen Xi absolutely didn’t have a friend or senior like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, Huangfu Qingying and the others completely trusted the geezer and were extremely respectful towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple. After the emissaries of the Dark Reverie had arrived, there were quite a few of them who’d set their sights on this northeast area of Primeval City, and they approached it menacingly. However, all of them were stunned when they saw the dirty geezer, and then they left hastily without saying a word. They seemed simply as if they were avoiding the god of plagues and were deeply afraid of being unable to avoid him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, because of the existence of this dirty geezer, he’d indirectly helped them deal with numerous dangerous situations, so how could they dare be the slightest bit disrespectful towards the dirty geezer?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I wonder where Chen Xi is. Why hasn’t he returned yet? Could it be that a mishap has occurred?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying pondered swiftly as her beautiful brows knit together lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This kid has finally arrived. He actually made me wait for such a long time, he truly deserves a beating.” Right at this moment, the dirty geezer suddenly tossed away the sparkling clean chicken bone in his hand and sat up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, he’d suddenly vanished from the throne as if he’d evaporated into thin air, and he didn’t even cause the slightest spatial fluctuation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Qingying and the others couldn’t help but gasp when they saw this scene, and even if they’d taken the dirty geezer to be an otherworldly expert, they still felt a wave of shock when they saw this bizarre scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s too terrifying! </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He teleported and vanished with a single thought! Such cultivation had obviously already attained a high degree of comprehension in the Spatial Grand Dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? Wait, could the person this old bastard spoke of be Chen Xi?” Young Master Zhou was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go over and have a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Chen Xi’s group of three had already found out that Yun Lansheng was really a member of the ancient paradise, the Heavenflow Dao Sect, and he was an extremely terrifying 8<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level Earthly Immortal Realm expert.</span></p>

The figure had a goatee, emitted the stench of alcohol while his eyes were muddy from his intoxication, and his clothes were tattered and dirty. He was precisely the dirty geezer Huangfu Qingying and the others were speaking about earlier.</span></p>
