 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f7d70663-539c-9a53-90cd-49a0fc7ab12b"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Performance Hall was the place where the Nine Radiance Sword Sect distributed the assignments of the sect and tested the contribution of disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The assignments of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect were divided into two types.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first were test assignments, and disciples were required to finish them within a set period of time as a way to test the strength and cultivation of disciples before using their results to distribute benefits and resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second were reward assignments. Anyone could take these assignments, and so long as one completed it, one would be able to obtain the corresponding reward. Moreover, according to the difference in difficulty, these reward assignments were divided into various levels and possessed various different rewards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Xin Ruhai had come over precisely for the sake of the test assignments that all the Elite Disciples of the West Radiance Peak had to complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the situation was extremely absurd when mentioned as well. Since Huo Molei and the others had entered the sect until now, they’d practically never completed a single test assignment throughout all these years, and if it wasn’t for Madman Liu standing out and dealing with it, they’d probably have been driven out of the sect a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was extremely simple, Huo Molei and the others were infatuated on their own path of the Dao, never left their residences, and remained aloof from worldly accomplishments. Moreover, they were utterly unskilled in battle and slaughter. On the other hand, the assignments distributed by the sect were mostly related to going out of the sect to gain experiences, and most of them had no lack of battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under these circumstances, asking Huo Molei and the others to go out and carry out these missions was no different than giving their lives away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alas, why has everything changed as soon as Master left?” Huo Molei sighed with a distressed expression. He knew that if Madman Liu was still here, then Xin Ruhai would absolutely not dare to be so forceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But speaking of all this wasn’t of much use now. After all, the test assignments were something that every single disciple of the sect had to completely. They’d already enjoyed special treatment for many years under Madman Liu’s protection, so they couldn’t complain about it being unfair when facing Xin Ruhai’s forceful attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t I go carry them out?” Meanwhile, Mu Kui noticed Huo Molei and the others had distressed expressions, and he was rather unable to bear seeing this, so he couldn’t help but speak out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You?” Xin Ruhai was slightly displeased, and he shook his head and said, “You aren’t an Elite Disciple of my Nine Radiance Sword Sect, so you don’t have the qualification to carry out assignments.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Kui frowned and was just about to say something when he was stopped by Huo Molei and the others. “Mu Kui, what Senior Brother Xin said is true. This assignment is for the sake of testing our cultivations and strength, and we can’t be assisted by others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good that all of you understand.” Xin Ruhai nodded and said, “Fellow Junior Brothers, I’m not intentionally making it difficult for all of you. This is an order from the elders, and I’m only carrying out an order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We understand,” said Huo Molei and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then all of you should make preparations and make time to receive the assignments from the Performance Hall. Remember, you have to complete all the delayed assignments in a month, otherwise if the elders want to punish all of you, then I’ll probably be unable to help all of you.” Xin Ruhai instructed and was about to leave when he suddenly thought of something, and then he hesitated for a moment before he said, “Actually, if all these assignments were given to Junior Brother Chen Xi, then with his strength, he ought to be able to finish them easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Junior Brother is in closed door cultivation. How can we disturb him?” Huo Molei shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is like that.” A wisp of curiosity suffused Xin Ruhai’s eyes as he muttered, and then he didn’t say anything further before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is like that? What does that mean? Could it be that he knew since long ago that my Master is cultivating behind closed doors?” Mu Kui couldn’t help but frown as he looked at Xin Ruhai’s figure that vanished in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who knows?” Huo Molei and the others were slightly dispirited and dejected because they didn’t have the slightest interest towards completing the test assignments of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they had no choice. They’d already perceived from Xin Ruhai’s attitude that if they didn’t complete the delayed assignments within a month this time, they would probably suffer punishment and be reduced to Inner Court disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You idiots! This matter can’t be any simpler. What’s there to be distressed about?” Right at this moment, a clear and resounding voice resounded out as Ling Bai flashed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was 10cm tall, his back was ramrod straight, and he floated in midair in white clothes and with a handsome appearance, causing him to possess an oppressive aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After staying on West Radiance Peak for half a month, Ling Bai had become familiar with Huo Molei and the others, so he didn’t have the slightest worries when he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, Ling Bai, do you have a method to resolve this?” The spirits of Huo Molei and the others were instantly refreshed as they asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s extremely simple. Choose one person from amongst all of you to receive the assignments. After that, I’ll accompany that person to complete the assignments, and wouldn’t everything be resolved?” said Ling Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But… Outsiders aren’t allowed to interfere in test assignments.” Huo Molei and the others scratched their heads as they spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stupid!” Ling Bai said bluntly, “So long as the assignments were completed quietly, who would know that it was I that assisted all of you to complete it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, this method really isn’t bad. I’ll make a trip with Ling Bai.” Qing Yu spoke heroically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He already understood clearly that his little junior brother Chen Xi was in closed door cultivation and was unable to help, whereas it was utterly impossible to complete all the delayed assignments with their ability. So he could only rely on Ling Bai’s strength to have a chance at resolving this difficult problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice, I heard you’re a disciple from the Azure Phoenix Clan. Looks like you can bear responsibility.” Ling Bai praised casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yu was praised to the point he instantly felt embarrassed. He always felt that he was a ‘variant’ of the Azure Phoenix Clan, and he didn’t have the slightest guts and valiance of the Azure Phoenix Clan. So he’d always been hiding on the West Radiance Peak and studying the things he liked, and he was happy and content with this because he didn’t have to worry if he would bring shame to the ancestors of the Azure Phoenix Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yu packed up his things right away before heading to the Performance Hall to receive the assignments, and then he left West Radiance Peak with Ling Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Yue Chi sat upright on the seat of the host within the gorgeous and grand pavilion. He wore a black robe with casually combed jet black hair, and his gaze was like bolts of cold lightning that were suffused with divine brilliance and filled with dignity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old man sat opposite him as well. The old man wore feathered clothes, had a rosy countenance, and every single move he made effused strands of Immortal Energy. Moreover, his aura wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to Yue Chi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shockingly, he was the elder that managed the Performance Hall, Elder Mo Yu, a great figure at the 9<sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level of the Earthly Immortal Realm.</span></p>

Brother Mo, don’t worry, I’ll remember this favor, and I’ll surely repay it heavily in the future.” Yue Chi smiled as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Yue, you’re treating me like an outsider. This is the duty of the Performance Hall.” Mo Yu smiled as he waved his hand, and then he frowned and spoke hesitantly. “But that kid is a hot figure of my Nine Radiance Sword Sect now, and even the Sect and the other elders favor him extremely and take him to be like a treasure. Brother Yue, your actions seem to be slightly…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t finish speaking, but the meaning within his words was something that anyone who wasn’t an idiot would be able to discern.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chi paused for a moment before he continued. “Not to mention I did this because I was just slightly unable to tolerate this. After all, our sect’s test assignments are something that every single disciple must complete, so on what basis does the West Radiance Peak enjoy special treatment? If this continues, then it’ll probably draw the displeasure of the disciples from the other peaks and cause voices of discontent to arise everywhere. That isn’t beneficial to the development and unity of our Nine Radiance Sword Sect.”</span></p>

What the fuck! You actually tried to teach me a lesson?!” Not long after Mo Yu left, Yue Chi’s expression instantly sank as he sneered repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Yue Chi, why get angry with him?” Right at this moment, a graceful figure suddenly appeared from the shadows of the hall. She had beautiful jet black hair, a fine and sharp nose, jade white teeth, sexy red lips, and a snow white swan-like neck, and coupled with her curvy figure that caused one’s blood to surge, she revealed allure that was capable of overturning the world.</span></p>

She was like a disaster that could charm and overturn a city, and her watery eyes seemed as if capable of taking away one’s soul with a single glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A trace of heat couldn’t help but arise from the depths of Yue Chi’s heart while his mouth went dry upon seeing this woman, but when he thought of this woman’s ruthless mind and cruel methods of killing, he instantly awoke from these feelings and didn’t dare have any other thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Xueyan, please go back and tell Senior Bing that I’ll surely drive this kid Chen Xi out of the Nine Radiance Sword Sect and hand him over to you to deal with.” Yue Chi smiled as he spoke. His voice actually carried a trace of faint respect when facing this beautiful woman that possessed boundless charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then how long more must I wait? Elder Yue Chi, you know as well that I’m only a messenger, so please don’t make it difficult for me.” Lights flowed within Xueyan’s eyes as she spoke with a grin. Her charming eyes, brilliant red lips, and jade white teeth were breathtaking when combined together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seductress!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chi cursed in his heart as he hastily took a deep breath and suppressed the heat in his heart that started to get restless, and he said, “Miss Xueyan, you’ve seen it as well. I don’t have the ability to make a move against Chen Xi right away while within the sect, so this matter has to be planned slowly and can’t be done hastily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Then you better not disappoint me, otherwise, I would be very sad.” Xueyan blinked her eyes, and she bit her sexy red lips as she spoke pitifully.</span></p>

Her techniques of charm are accomplished naturally, and she’s simply capable of charming a person to death.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice hadn’t finished resounding in the air when she’d already carried a strand of fragrance and vanished trippingly.</span></p>
