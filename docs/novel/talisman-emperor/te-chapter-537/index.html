Still thinking of escaping with the Ghostrain Division Arts?” After annihilating Lu Gang, Chen Xi suddenly turned his head to look coldly towards the distant sky with a gaze that seemed like bolts of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi stretched his hand out and grabbed towards the space before him, causing that expanse of space he was looking at to instantly explode and forced a figure out from within it. The figure staggered, and it was covered in dim violet flames, causing the figure to seemed like a myriad of violet colored fireflies that were fluttered about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Ghost Emperor Li Huang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was truly afraid. Up until this point in the battle, his formidable outside help that had traversed through the Dark Reverie to arrive at the Primeval Battlefield had perished one after the other, whereas the various abilities Chen Xi executed were so terrifying and caused him to feel despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only flee and temporarily endure patiently for another opportunity to arise.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who exactly are you? How could you possibly know of the Ghostrain Division Arts of my Ghost World!?” Li Huang gritted his teeth as he shouted out explosively, and his voice trembled slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You executed the Ghostrain Division Arts during the primeval times, you were able to conceal it from the gods, but you weren’t able to conceal it from me…” Chen Xi spoke slowly with a voice that didn’t contain any feelings of price, and his voice contained a feeling of regret and a sense of loss instead. “If I annihilated you at that time, then the calamity of today probably wouldn’t have happened…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Huang was instantly flabbergasted as he stared fixedly at Chen Xi, and his appearance seemed as if he’d seen a ghost as he howled. “How could that be possible? The gods of the primeval times were so formidable, yet they didn’t notice my tracks! How could you possibly know!? Could it be that you’re even more formidable than the gods of the primeval times? What a joke! If you were really so formidable, then why were the gods of the primeval times annihilated by our armies?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Li Huang seemed to have been provoked greatly, and he seemed as if he’d gone mad while his voice resounded in the heavens and the earth and shook the clouds in all directions to the point of collapsing inch by inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the city was astounded while they looked at this scene in shock, and their hearts were unable to calm down for a long time. The conversation between the Ghost Emperor Li Huang and Chen Xi involved the gods of the primeval times, and it had already exceeded the scope of their imaginations!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be… Could it be that you’re…?” Li Huang seemed to have thought of something, causing his expression to suddenly go pale as he trembled while pointing at Chen Xi with, and then his mouth opened wide before he said with a voice that carried indescribable terror. “You’re Yu…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

A myriad of profound techniques moved along with his fist, and it blasted Li Huang’s neck apart before he could finish speaking. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, milky white divine flames gushed out from Chen Xi’s right hand and descended onto Li Huang, and it instantly incinerated him into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I never imagined that a momentary mistake of mine all those years ago almost caused a calamity today…” Chen Xi muttered as he looked at Li Huang’s corpse that was incinerated bit by bit into nothingness, and his tone carried boundless loneliness and melancholy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the city was silent as they watched this scene as they were already unable to find words to describe their feelings at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Emperor Li Huang, this formidable existence that had once battled the gods during the primeval times had survived through countless years, yet now, he’d died at Chen Xi’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a scene was simply more unbelievable and shocking than the legend of the expedition of the gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave. The Primeval Battlefield is about to close…” Up above in the sky, Chen Xi swept everyone with his gaze before finally looking at the lofty city that rise and fell continuously into the distance, and he went silent for a moment before sighing lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

A wisp of an illusory shadow flew out from Chen Xi’s body, and it carried a jade cauldron as it instantly vanished in the extremely distant horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is…</span></p>

When they looked once more at Chen Xi, they really noticed that his cultivation had declined greatly, and he didn’t have a trace of the all powerful and dominating imposing aura that he had earlier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Like I said, how could a Rebirth Realm cultivator possibly possess such a terrifying strength? So it turns out that he was possessed by a great figure and had his mind controlled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it’s surely like this. That shadow from before was probably that great figure, right? He annihilated four Xeno-race experts successively, such ability is simply horrifying!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, that great figure is gone. If we’re able to be guided slightly by him, then it would benefit us for life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone roughly guessed something from that scene from before, and they discussed animatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the happiness of obtaining new life from a hopeless situation quickly caused them to forget everything. Moreover, they noticed to their pleasant surprise that the specter army outside the city was retreating like tidewater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one obstructed or hindered this because the Ghost Emperor Li Huang was already dead, and it was impossible for this specter army to accomplish anything any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention all of them had fought for a long time and had experienced a great and horrifying incident earlier, causing their bodies and minds to be exhausted to the extreme long ago, so no one had the mood to annihilate the specter army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before everyone could fight to rescue him, a figure had already instantly appeared before Chen Xi and carried him on his shoulder. This person had a goatee, smelt of wine, and his entire figure was slovenly to the extreme. It was precisely Madman Liu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only fainted from exhaustion.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They accompanied Madman Liu to send Chen Xi back to his residence in the northeast area to rest.</span></p>

At this moment, they only had to return to their residences and listen to the arrangement of the emissaries.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the others, perhaps what they experienced today was simply no different than obtaining new life after a calamity, and even though their minds and bodies were exhausted, their joy was impossible to conceal.</span></p>
