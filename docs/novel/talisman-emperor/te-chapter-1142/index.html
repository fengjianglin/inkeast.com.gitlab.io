 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immortal swords that had transformed into arrows were sharp, precise, and swift like bolts of lightning. They tore space apart and pierced the ground, and they seemed to be merciless, overbearing, and ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three more disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan were killed immediately. One was pierced through the chest, one through the forehead, and the last was the most tragic, it pierced through his right eye and the came out from the back of his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In merely a short moment, only three remained from the nine clansmen that Zuoqiu Zheng had led over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood sprayed and made the Bloodied Forest seem even more bright red and gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six violet rays of light shot into the sky, and it represented the six disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan that had been eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the beginning until the end, Zuoqiu Zheng and the others hadn’t noticed Chen Xi’s figure at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, they’d noticed it, but they’d only seen him from the back when they saw him for the first time, and it wasn’t Chen Xi at all. It was the Illusory Demonflower that had taken Chen Xi’s form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The objective of this was naturally to mislead the members of the Zuoqiu Clan and draw their attention so that Chen Xi could hunt and kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, these events that had just occurred proved that Chen Xi had already succeeded by more than half.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the reason why Chen Xi had spared Wei Na’s life. She was an Illusory Demonflower that was skilled in the art of transformation and illusions. She was capable of skillfully transforming into any form to the point it was indistinguishable from the original, so it could be utilized to mislead his enemies and take them by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal swords that played the role of arrows tore through the sky once more, and it seemed to intend to eliminate all the last four members of the Zuoqiu Clan that remained here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zuoqiu Zheng and the other three had gathered together while each facing one of the four directions, allowing them to possess a watertight defense. Even though the immortal swords were formidable, yet it was very difficult for the immortal swords to cause any further lethal injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In next to no time, the arrows that tore through the sky had stopped abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because at this moment, a group of figures had already charged into the sky from Hawksorrow Mountain that was 1,000km away from Bloodied Forest, and they were flying over here swiftly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Zuoqiu Yin had noticed the signal and was leading the clansmen of the Zuoqiu Clan to assist Zuoqiu Zheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mere 1,000km could be traversed in the time of a few breaths by an expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Zuoqiu Zheng and the other three didn’t dare be careless in the slightest. All of them had gloomy and livid expressions, and their eyes had turned crimson red and blazed with the flames of hatred and rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scenes that had occurred moments ago were simply like hovering over the edge of death to them. Especially when they saw their companions fall successively right before their eyes, the rage and hatred in their hearts was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi! You won’t be able to escape!” Zuoqiu Zheng let out a roar that was low like a wild beast from the depths of his throat, and it was extremely resentful as it reverberated through the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought that Chen Xi had noticed the arrival of Zuoqiu Yin and the others, so Chen Xi had already fled, causing his expression to seem extremely disgruntled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who told you that I’m fleeing?” A light and indifferent voice resounded, and then Chen Xi’s tall figure appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He glanced at Zuoqiu Yin and the others in the distance who were about to arrive then glanced at Zuoqiu Zheng’s group of four before him, and he said, “All three hundred eliminations are on the verge of being used up. I would be letting all of you go too easily if I left at this moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s voice had just resounded when a wisp of sword qi slashed out from his palm. It was powerful like a raging ocean, and it transformed into a myriad of strands of sword qi waves that rumbled as they surged forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sword of Water — Boundless Ocean! A strike that forms a boundless ocean that covers the sky and blots out the sun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi’s voice was still drifting through the air when Zuoqiu Zheng and the others let out a wave of terrified and furious roars, and then they were drowned by the surging ocean formed from the myriad of strands of sword qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were like tiny pebbles thrown into a lake, and they only caused a ripple before vanishing without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chen Xi’s voice finished resounding through the air, the withered trees and rocks within an area of 500km in the Bloodied Forest had transformed into powder while numerous horrifying rifts had appeared on the ground, whereas the figures of Zuoqiu Zheng and the other three were nowhere to be found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zuoqiu Yin and the others had just arrived as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They naturally saw this astonishing scene. They saw the magnificent and boundless sword strike and didn’t even have the time to let out an exclamation of shock before they weren’t able to find the figures of Zuoqiu Zheng and the other three any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They merely saw four violet colored rays of light charging out from the ocean of sword qi before vanishing without a trace. In other words, Zuoqiu Zheng and the nine clansmen he led over had all been eliminated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi had vanished along with them. Of course, Chen Xi wasn’t eliminated, and it was instead because he felt it would be difficult to kill another disciple of the Zuoqiu Clan, so he left decisively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pursue him! Kill that despicable and ruthless bastard!” Many disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan roared with fury while intending to charge over and pursue Chen Xi to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop!” Zuoqiu Yin’s expression was extremely livid as he shouted coldly at them. “Could it be that all of you want to be eliminated as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But, could it be that we’re just going to let him off like that?” All of them were unwilling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The important matter at hand is self-preservation! Self-preservation! Understand?” Zuoqiu Yin took a few successive deep breaths. How could he not be furious in his heart? It was even to the extent that he was about to become overwhelmed with anger from the scenes that had occurred before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was similarly clearly aware that if they were to pursue now and Chen Xi were to seize this opportunity to kill a few more disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan, then he would be unable to bear the consequences!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Zuoqiu Zheng and the other nine disciples that had been eliminated earlier were existences ranked in the top hundred during the first round of the test. The elimination of every single one of them was an extraordinarily huge blow to the Zuoqiu Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin was very clearly aware that if he were to return to the clan now, then he would surely be held responsible and might even suffer an extremely severe punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, Zuoqiu Yin couldn’t afford to take the risk, and he completely gave up the thought of hunting and killing Chen Xi. He placed all his thoughts on self-preservation instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up until this point in the test, fifteen of the seventy six Zuoqiu Clan disciples participating in the second round of the test had been lost. Four amongst them had vanished without reason, whereas the remaining eleven had all been killed by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, only sixty one disciples were still alive, whereas, even if Zuoqiu Yin was included, then the disciples amongst them that were ranked in the top hundred during the first round only numbered to a total of six!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, even though there were sixty one of them, besides these six people, the other disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan had positions below the top hundred during the first round of the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What did this mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It meant that even if all of them were to pass smoothly through the third round of the test, their overall ranking would surely be very much inferior, and it would even be to the extent that they might be unable to compare with the disciples of the other great ancient clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet it was only a single person that caused all of this!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought up to here, a wisp of an indescribably complicated feeling that was a mix of hatred, rage, resentment, frustration, and so on and so forth surged into Zuoqiu Yin’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Om!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a wave of strange fluctuation suddenly spread throughout the Bloodlands, and then an obscure strand of intent transformed into an emotionless voice that resounded throughout every inch of space in the Bloodlands. “The elimination requirement of the second round of the test has ended. Now, the amount of Starpoints will determine your final position in this round of the test!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as these words were spoken, all the disciples that were lucky enough to be still surviving in the Bloodlands heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts. They knew that even if they were killed now, they would still be able to participate in the third round of the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the expressions of Zuoqiu Yin and the others changed violently without end. All of this meant that they would be unable to stop Chen Xi from entering Dao Emperor Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected that I would be unable to complete the Young Miss’s plan in the end…” Zuoqiu Yin laughed bitterly while his voice revealed a wisp of indescribably heaviness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others had dim expressions as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, many of them actually heaved sighs of relief in their hearts because in this way, they naturally didn’t have to worry about being killed by Chen Xi’s surprise attacks and losing their qualifications to participate in the third round of the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter isn’t over.” Right amidst this silence, a calm and indifferent voice suddenly resounded, and it was heard clearly by Zuoqiu Yin and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, all their expressions sank once more while they gnashed their teeth without end. This was a warning, and it was provocation towards all of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damnable bastard! Get the fuck out here if you dare!” A disciple was unable to restrain the rage in his heart any longer, and he howled with a grim voice. But the surroundings were deathly silent, and Chen Xi’s voice didn’t appear again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack! Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Yin’s fists were clenched tightly together to the point his veins bulged while his joints cracked. He gritted his teeth yet didn’t speak in the end, and he led all the disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan to turn around and leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after Zuoqiu Yin and the others left, Chen Xi’s figure appeared within Bloodied Forest, and he muttered while looking towards the direction they left. “Unfortunately, the elimination quota is full…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath and withdrew a large bow before placing it on his palm and stroking it lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This large bow was completely pitch black and suffused with an icy cold and murderous aura. It was a mid-rank Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact, and Chen Xi had obtained it from a one of the Cosmos Beast lords under Whitetail King’s command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, it lacked a formidable immortal arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Immortal Bow couldn’t do without a bowstring, a body, and an arrow. Moreover, they were critical towards bringing out the might of the bow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Overall, this bow was a good Darkspirit Grade Immortal Artifact, but because it was lacking a matching arrow, it was very difficult to completely bring forth its might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi could only utilize ordinary immortal swords as arrows in order to hunt and kill those disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, he’d annihilated a large amount of Whitetail King’s subordinates, and he’d gathered over a hundred immortal swords when he cleaned up the battlefield, so it was sufficient for him to use for a long period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Chen Xi had some attainments in the Dao of Archery and coupled with the assistance of the Eye of Divine Truth, it allowed him to always be in an ever successful state while hunting and killing the disciples of the Zuoqiu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he couldn’t do without Wei Na’s assistance when annihilating Zuoqiu Zheng and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought up to here, Chen Xi flickered his sleeve and let out Wei Na who was in the form of a rabbit. After that, he withdrew a few Immortal Artifacts that were in good condition in passed them to her as he said, “You did well earlier. This is your reward. You can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na was stunned and slightly taken by surprise. Or perhaps, Chen Xi’s actions were too sudden to her, and she felt slight disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She stuttered after a long time. “You…really intend to let me go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded. “Didn’t I promise you before that so long as you help me accomplish something, then I would let you go? I naturally do as I say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na was stunned, and she couldn’t help but ask weakly. “I’m a Cosmos Beast. You’re…just going to let me off like this?”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi frowned. “In my eyes, there are only enemies and friends. If you don’t leave now, then you won’t have a chance to leave in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na wasn’t terrified but delighted instead when she heard this, and her long rabbit ears perked up as she nodded forcefully. “Then I’ll leave when you leave the Bloodlands!”&nbsp;</span></p>
