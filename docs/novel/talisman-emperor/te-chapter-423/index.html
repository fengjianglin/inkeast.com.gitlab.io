He struggled for a moment, yet besides feeling waves of heart rending intense pain, he wasn’t even able to lift a finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow! Such a handsome little fellow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s handsome indeed. His brows and nose are like Chen Xi, and his eyes and mouth are like his mother. Moreover, his skin is so glistening and exquisite. He’s simply even more beautiful than a girl.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me see, let me see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short moment, waves of exclamations of admiration sounded out from outside the room, and it caused Chen Xi to burn with impatience. It felt as if a hundred claws were scratching at his heart, and he was anxious to the point of wishing for nothing more than to have another pair of legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when Chen Xi was feeling extremely anxious, everyone crowded around a young boy as they entered the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young boy was around the age of four or five, and he wore embroidered white silk clothes. He had a pair of dashing brows and starry eyes, a pair of vermillion lips and white teeth, and space between his brows was filled with heroic spirit and extraordinary intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was young, he didn’t possess a mischievous disposition, and he was calm and composed. At this moment, when everyone crowded around him like a host of stars crowding around the bright moon, he wasn’t embarrassed in the slightest nor did he reveal an expression of arrogance and complacency. His disposition was calm and tranquil, neither arrogant nor impetuous, and every single move of his faintly possessed the indifferent style that Qing Xiuyi possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little fellow was naturally Chen An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi was stunned as soon as he laid eyes of Chen An. It was as if he’d noticed the most precious and most outstanding divine object in the world, causing his gaze to carry an overjoyed, gratified, shocked, and dazed expression, and he was unable to return to his senses for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi was staring at Chen An, the little fellow was staring at Chen Xi as well. His gaze was deep and lively, and it carried a trace of curiosity, yet it didn’t contain the excitement that Chen Xi had imagined him to have when seeing his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps, this was his most authentic reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the day he was born, he’d never experienced what fatherly love was, nor did he know that there was another most intimate person in the world, and the person was called ‘father.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was pulled over here by his mother to acknowledge his father and had met Chen Xi now, he was only curious, yet wasn’t really excited or happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Chen Xi noticed the wisp of unfamiliarity and curiosity in the eyes of Chen An, a wisp of grief and pain gushed out abruptly from his heart for no reason or rhyme.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps An’er had utterly no knowledge of my existence in the past?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I know if uncle is my father?” Chen An spoke out with a clear voice and a serious expression, and he was extremely courteous, causing him to seem as if he wasn’t acknowledging a loved one but was speaking solemnly to a senior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Chen Xi replied without the slightest hesitation. He knew that since they hadn’t met for many years, there was an enormous unfamiliarity and barrier between him and An’er. But, he believed firmly that so long as the little fellow stayed by his side, this layer of barrier would be completely eliminated, and Chen An would feel his care and affection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother told me that you’ll take good care of me in the future, right?” Chen An opened his clear and pitch black eyes wide as he looked directly at Chen Xi and continued speaking seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Chen Xi replied extremely firmly, and his words revealed an undoubtable feeling. After that, he seemed to have realized something, and he hesitated for a long time before he asked. “Could it be that you don’t feel unwilling to be separated from your mother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An went silent as his eyes went red and seemed as if tears were about to drop out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi wished for nothing more than to slap himself when he saw this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s obvious that An’er had just separated with Qing Xiuyi and has a bad mood, yet I still mentioned this matter. I’m truly an idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, where’s your mother? I heard earlier that she brought you over.” Chen Xi took a deep breath and tried to console the little fellow so that the little fellow wouldn’t be too sad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My mother has left…” But, the effect was exactly the opposite. Mentioning Qing Xiuyi caused a layer of tears to gush onto Chen An’s eyes that were already red, and they were about to fall at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little fellow’s miserable appearance when being on the verge of tears caused Chen Xi to be completely flurried. At this moment, he suddenly felt that he was simply too stupid and had completely lost his former composure and intelligence, causing him to simply be no different than a pig.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then…” Chen Xi opened his mouth yet hesitated to speak as he was extremely afraid of upsetting the little fellow again, and his feelings were complicated to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every one was both amused and felt pity towards this pair of father and son when they saw this. They’d finally met each other after not meeting each other for many years, yet there wasn’t any excitement or happiness that everyone expected, and the two of them seemed like unfamiliar people, causing it to be an extremely saddening sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when everyone attempted to speak out and adjust the atmosphere, Chen An took a deep breath abruptly, and his clear eyes looked seriously at Chen Xi as he said, “My mother said, that I should learn how to be independent and not rely on anyone even if I follow by father’s side. So you don’t have to worry about me making trouble for you, and I won’t cry and make others laugh at you as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An paused briefly and continued. “If I do unsatisfactorily, feel free to punish me. I’ll absolutely not get angry with you.”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An’s clear, melodious, and young voice reverberated in the room, causing everyone to feel into soundless silence.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly what sort of environment would cause a four or five year old child to know how to show understanding and console another?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, tears couldn’t help but flow abruptly from Chen Xi’s eyes, and he said with a trembling voice, “An’er, can you come over and hug me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for his entire body lacking the slightest bit of energy, he wished so much to spread his arms, pull the little fellow into his embrace, and protect Chen An by his side forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course. I’ll listen to everything you say in the future.” Chen An nodded before walking forward and opening his arms to lightly hug Chen Xi’s neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he rested his chin on An’er’s rather thin and tiny shoulder, Chen Xi was unable to control his feelings as he repeated An’er’s name over and over again. He’d recalled his grandfather, recalled his parents that had gone missing without a trace, he’d recalled… At this moment, he wished so much that all of them were present to share this extremely great pleasant surprise with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tears flowed uncontrollably from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone saw this, they left the room silently as they were deeply afraid they would disturb the intimate exchange between this pair of father and son.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

The meridians in his entire body were broad, tough, tensile, crystalline, and translucent, his bones were snow white, pure, and suffused with a light gold crystalline sheen, his vast vital energy and blood flowed throughout his entire body like a boiling torrent, and his internal organs resonated and resounded out with the sound of the Grand Dao.</span></p>

A light sweep of his soul caused any slight movement in an area of 5,000km to be unable to escape his detection.</span></p>

If he were to go against a Rebirth Realm cultivator now, then he was confident in being able to kill the Rebirth Realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the benefits of the Dragon Origin Essence weren’t just this. It was even to the extent that he’d only completely refined 10% of the Dragon Origin Essence he absorbed from the Dragon Transformation Pool, and all the remaining 90% was sealed within his body, waiting to be utilized to condense his Rebirth Wheel when he advanced to the Rebirth Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such shocking improvement in strength didn’t cause Chen Xi to feel happy in the slightest, as his current thoughts were completely placed on his son, Chen An.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being in contact for this half a month of time, he and Chen An had already gradually become familiar with each other. At least, the little fellow had already started to slowly open up his heart and talk with his father, Chen Xi, about things that happened in the earlier parts of his life. Even though it was a mere few words, it already caused Chen Xi to grin from ear to ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what troubled Chen Xi was that up until now, An’er had never addressed him as father and had always addressed him as ‘you.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, there was still a shapeless barrier in An’er’s young heart towards Chen Xi, his biological father. Perhaps, on the day this barrier vanished would be the day that this pair of father and son would be considered to be truly on extremely intimate terms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi understood that he couldn’t rush this, and he required time to slowly melt the barrier. &nbsp;</span></p>

Just yesterday, Zhen Liuqing had already sent news that three days from now, Emperor Chu would summon the top 10 in the Allstar Meeting this time to discuss the matter of entering the Primeval Battlefield.</span></p>
