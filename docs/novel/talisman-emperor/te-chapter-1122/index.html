 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, Darkombat City was surging like an ocean with people, and it was an unprecedentedly grand scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the entrance to the inner city was open, and the scene within it was shocking to many because instead of calling it an inner city, it should instead be called a mountain range that rose and fell without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountains rose and fell, and they were covered in ancient trees and mist. The deeper they moved in, the more beautiful the mountains were. It was covered in rosy clouds and numerous immortal beasts moved about within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many clear lakes on the way, and they emanated strands of dense mist and were filled with exuberant vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beautiful and extraordinary, a paradise drifting with auspicious qi. It truly is a great place. This is still only the outer area of Darkombat City’s inner city, yet it’s already such a scene. It’s already on par with some top rate paradises.” Someone praised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course! This is the number one academy in the Immortal Dimension. Normally, can anyone besides students of the academy enter this area?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd surged towards the depths of the inner city, and only after walking over 50km ahead did they notice a stone stele that shot into the sky standing ahead. There were three words written on the stone stele — Dao Emperor Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strokes of the writing were extremely heavy and boundlessly powerful. It faintly emanated a boundlessly grand aura. When looked at from afar, it caused an ancient imposing aura to assault one’s face, and it caused one’s heart to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“According to legend, this stone stele was inscribed by the Dao Emperor himself when the academy was first built, and it carries a trace of a supreme aura of the Dao. The Flaming Rain, Ling Qingwu, one of the six blazing suns perceived a trace of its profundity by chance and attained the Golden Immortal Realm to ascend into the ranks of the blazing suns!” Someone sighed with emotion, and it drew the blazing gazes of many young disciples while their hearts surged without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quickly go on ahead. Once all of you pass the test and enter Dao Emperor Academy, all of you can come here to comprehend it at all times. There’s no hurry.” Someone experienced reminded all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, the crowd continued heading towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they passed this stone stele, their field of vision opened up. A vast and flat square lay ahead. The ground of the square was covered in white and smooth jade while strands of mist drifted about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When looked at from afar, it was like a layer of ice that had frozen on the surface of the boundless sea. It was jade white, translucent, and emanated a vast and divine aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even further into the distance from the square was row upon row of grand buildings. Every single building emanated an ancient aura and seemed to have experienced the passage of countless years, causing everyone to be unable to help but arose reverence in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s Dao Emperor Academy, a place that gave birth to countless legends!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they gazed at the building that stood silently in the extreme distance, many people let out exclaims of admiration, and their gazes revealed yearning and reverence that wasn’t concealed in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were no less than ten thousand people that were already on the vast square, and a dense mass of figures were everywhere the eye could see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not everyone had the qualifications to enter after Dao Emperor Academy opened the entrance to the inner city during the recruitment test this time. Besides the young disciples that would definitely participate in the tests, only the great figures from the top powers in the Immortal Dimension were allowed entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it wasn’t for this restriction, then the entire inner city of Darkombat City would probably be filled in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi, Gu Yueming, Liang Ren, Jiang Zhuliu, and Yin Miaomiao followed behind Tie Qiuyu and smoothly arrived on the vast square before Dao Emperor Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were even more experts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Chen Xi’s most direct feeling. Within the dense mass of people that seemed to form an ocean, everyone possessed an extremely formidable aura. It was an astonishing sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, the top experts of the younger generation in the 4,900 continents of the Immortal Dimension were converged on the square before him, so it was impossible to find a single weakling amongst them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coupled with most of these experts were escorted by the seniors of their clans or sect, and it was naturally impossible for these seniors to be weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simply speaking, the top experts of the Immortal Dimension’s younger generation were gathered on the square before Dao Emperor Academy at this moment, and one could take pride in one’s ability to be standing here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do all of you see those grand halls at the side of the square? Those are prepared by Dao Emperor Academy for the distinguished guests of the three dimensions. The disciples from the seven great ancient clans and the top powers of the four great continents are in there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Besides that, the powers of the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, and Phoenix Dimension have been arranged to reside within it. Once the test begins, the young disciples amongst them would come to participate in the test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone pointed towards the side of the halls. There were numerous gorgeous mountains there, and those mountains were covered in numerous residences. At this moment, there were many figures standing before those residences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt envious. But they were also clearly aware that they were unable to compare with those existences. After all, the difference in their statuses was too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On what basis are they able to reside in those halls while we have to wait on this square?” Someone couldn’t refrain himself from speaking in a sour tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as these words were spoken, it instantly caused numerous people to reveal ridicule and roll their eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On what basis? This question is really childish. Could it be that you don’t know that many great figures of the seven great ancient clans and the various top powers are teaching in Dao Emperor Academy? Since the disciples of the powers they belong to are coming to participate in the test, they’re naturally able to enjoy greater convenience.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn’t just that, the Buddha Dimension, Dragon Dimension, Phoenix Clan, and the various other mysterious domains mostly have a deep relationship with Dao Emperor Academy. According to my knowledge, an Azure Dragon that possesses the highest bloodline in the Dragon Dimension is teaching in Dao Emperor Academy, and he has always been protecting the Dao Scripture Pavilion of the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alas, don’t mention all of this. When you’re able to become a blazing sun of the Immortal Dimension, then you’ll naturally have the qualifications to enjoy such treatment. Otherwise, if it’s in terms of background, you’ll never be able to compare with those clans and sects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd discussed animatedly, and as the discussion went on, all of them sighed endlessly with emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi wasn’t interested in all of this, and he asked Tie Qiuyu in a low voice. “Senior, when will the test begin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu raised his head to look at the sky to discern the time of the day, and then he said, “Soon, in less than fifteen minutes. At that time, Dao Emperor Academy will naturally send over some higher-ups to &nbsp;preside over the test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi nodded. It was only fifteen minutes, and it would pass very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chen Xi, there’s no need to be worried. So long as you pass the first round of the test, then I’ll accompany you during the second round of the test. I refuse to believe they’ll be able to do anything to us.” At this moment, Liang Ren suddenly spoke in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Count me in as well.” Gu Yueming spoke as well. As he spoke, he glanced coldly at the nearby Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he instantly understood that they probably thought he was worried that he would suffer the vengeance of the Zuoqiu Clan, Yin Miaomiao, and Jiang Zhuliu during the second round of the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt warm in his heart, yet he shook his head and said, “There’s no need.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Ren frowned. “This isn’t the time to act strong. Not to mention that it’s impossible for us to sit idly by and remain indifferent towards something that concerns you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, how will you go against them all alone by yourself?” Gu Yueming frowned as he spoke as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi laughed bitterly and took a deep breath before he said seriously, “I have the ability to deal with this matter. There’s no need for the two of you to get involved, so as to avoid the Zuoqiu Clan bearing a grudge against the two of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was indeed suggesting it sincerely, but these words caused Liang Ren and Gu Yueming to feel slightly displeased instead. They felt that Chen Xi was treating them like outsiders, and that he was underestimating their character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi instantly knew that the situation wasn’t good when he saw their expressions. However, he thought for a moment yet was unable to figure out how he should explain it to them, so he instantly started laughing bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Or perhaps, you think we’re a burden?” Gu Yueming’s brows knit together even more tightly when he saw Chen Xi acting in this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi thought for a moment, and he said in the end, “Please believe me. I’ll surely be able to deal with this matter by myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they watched these three people acting in this way, even though the nearby Yin Miaomiao and Jiang Zhuliu hadn’t said anything, their gazes were suffused with a wisp of faint ridicule, and it was even to the extent that their gazes towards Chen Xi even carried a wisp of pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi naturally noticed all of this, yet he didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, the first round of the test is about to begin. Unless you’re able to firmly surpass Jiang Zhuliu in the Ascension Immortal Rankings, otherwise, we won’t agree to allow you to take action by yourself during the second round of the test.” Liang Ren spoke abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi was stunned, and then he shrugged while feeling speechless. He didn’t speak any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason he was speechless was that he firmly believed that he was capable of easily capturing and killing Jiang Zhuliu. After all, compared to the Void Guard, Lu Chen, Jiang Zhuliu was greatly inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, Chen Xi wouldn’t even take Jiang Zhuliu to be an opponent when the tests begin later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” Jiang Zhuliu grunted coldly. Liang Ren hadn’t concealed what he said, and Jiang Zhuliu had heard it clearly. He felt a wave of displeasure when he heard Liang Ren comparing him to Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Miaomiao puckered her lips at the side and revealed indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Xi, Liang Ren, and Gu Yueming similarly chose to react to this with indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The relationship between them was already like fire and water, so continuing to cover it up would only cause them to seem extremely hypocritical, and it wasn’t worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tie Qiuyu noticed all of this, and he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enmity between these little fellows is truly a headache. Nevermind, let them fight each other. I can’t be bothered about it. In any case, it isn’t me who’s losing face…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dang! Dang! Dang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a wave of the ring of a bell resounded through the heavens and the earth. The sound rose and fell melodiously, and it was like the tune of the Grand Dao that struck directly at one’s heart. It caused the hearts of everyone present to shake while their entire bodies felt refreshed, and the distracting thoughts within their minds were instantly cleared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dao Bell has been rung! The test is finally about the begin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, the clamorous discussion in the vast square had vanished, and it became solemn and silent. The gazes of everyone had shot towards Dao Emperor Academy in unison, and their gazes revealed a wisp of excitement that was impossible to conceal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous figures that emanated vast and mighty divine might soared into the sky like vast suns rising into the sky. They emanated boundless imposing auras that enveloped the heavens and the earth. There were seven of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aura of every single figure was vast and divine. It was like an abyss and possessed the might to control the world and look down upon all living beings. Their cultivations had practically attained the Saint Immortal Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially the middle aged man in the lead that wore a loose scholar’s robe and had a serious expression. He possessed a boundless aura that was obscure like the ocean, and it shook the energy in the heavens and the earth for an area of 50,000km in the surroundings, causing it to become extremely silent. He was like an overlord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A Half-step Immortal King!” Someone exclaimed with shock in a low voice, and then abruptly went silent. The person didn’t dare make any further noise as he was deeply afraid of infuriating this expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even then, this voice was still heard by most people, and the atmosphere instantly became silent, perfectly silent. The atmosphere was solemn and carried an oppressive aura. The gazes everyone shot at those seven figures couldn’t help but reveal a wisp of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six great figures at the Saint Immortal Realm and a Half-step Immortal King were actually sent out for a recruitment test! This…this is absolutely an extravagant display!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
