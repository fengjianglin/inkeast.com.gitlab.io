As she gazed at the tall figure that sat cross-legged at the center of the Dao platform, her gaze overflowed with light and was suffused with ripples of extraordinary splendor.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Dao was in a period of great prosperity and all clans were contending with each other. It was absolutely the most brilliant and resplendent period in the cultivation world.</span></p>

But so long as he continued forward firmly while possessing this broad-mindedness and bearing, then his path in the Dao would be so wide that it was bound to be immeasurable.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

If one’s heart is clear, then it will glow, and the Dao would be everywhere.”</span></p>

It caused all of them to obtain great comprehension and lose their minds in this moment of sudden enlightenment.</span></p>

It was like two experts were sparring in experience, and they obtained great benefit from it and solved many questions and problems that troubled them.</span></p>

At this moment, he’d fallen into a strange state. His mind was pure and clear while numerous comprehensions rose up successively into his heart.</span></p>

Some were able to read a book to the point of obtaining deep understanding, and some were able to read a book to the point of being capable of summarizing it, whereas there were some that were capable of obtaining deep understanding and then summarizing it.</span></p>

One experienced the passage of time, summarized one’s gains and losses, and then became immersed in one’s comprehensions. Only in this way could travel through the path of life to a farther and higher point in an easier manner.</span></p>
