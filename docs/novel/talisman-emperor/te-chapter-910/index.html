The empty feeling of hitting nothing caused Chen Xi’s vital blood to roil, and he was almost unable to restrain his energy.</span></p>

Your Heart Energy cultivation has actually attained the Heart Soul realm.” Accompanying this voice was Bai Jingchen’s robust figure appearing in the hall.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Chen Xi to be shocked in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exactly what sort of cultivation has Bai Jingchen attained?</span></p>

So long as you’re able to receive three punches of mine, then you’re almost capable of fighting of Bing Shitian.” Bai Jingchen arrived swiftly and left swiftly as well. His voice hadn’t finished resounding in the air when his figure had already vanished, and from the beginning until the end, he actually caused everyone to be unable to notice exactly how he left.</span></p>

All those years ago when he roamed the world, he’d even slaughtered his way into the lair of the Xeno-race, causing him to be renowned in the world, and he’d only started staying in the clan recently and gradually withdrew from the eyes of the world.</span></p>

At the very least, in the memories of these clansmen of the Bai Clan, the Patriarch hadn’t revealed his cultivation for a few hundreds of years.</span></p>

So who would miss the collision between these two?</span></p>

Open your eyes widely and fucking watch properly. The Patriarch will only be executing three punches, and if all of you are capable of learning even the slightest bit from it, it’ll be sufficient for all of you to benefit from for your entire lifetimes!” Bai Tuo who was 3m tall and like a small hill roared, and he was teaching the young youths before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Gunan noticed Bai Tuo and was instantly amused, and he said with a smile, “This fellow’s resistance is really formidable. He was slapped to such an extent by A’Man yesterday, yet he’s actually so spirited today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A’Man chuckled and scratched his head.</span></p>

I hope he doesn’t get beaten down by a single punch or this won’t be worth watching.” A young man spoke in a clear voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah, didn’t a fellow that called himself an elder of the Nether Spring Devil Sect come to look for trouble all those years ago? In the end, he was directly flicked away with a single finger of the Patriarch. So no matter how formidable Chen Xi is, he’s only an Earthly Immortal Realm expert in the end. I’m worried he won’t be able to resist even a single punch as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That might not be the case. With the Patriarch’s identity and strength, he’ll surely not utilize his entire strength. After all, Chen Xi is a guest of our Bai Clan, and the Patriarch has to leave his dignity intact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, the cultivations of the Patriarch and Chen Xi isn’t equal, nor are their strengths equal. Once the battle begins, the Patriarch will surely hold back a certain amount of his strength. But I wonder if that Chen Xi will actually be able to endure three punches.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The martial practice grounds was filled with clamorous discussion. They were guessing various possibilities, and some even couldn’t restrain from desiring to bet on how many punches Chen Xi would be able to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Chen Xi, good luck! Defeat that dirty old man!” Right at this moment, a clear and melodious voice sounded out in the martial practice hall, and it instantly caused the jaws of everyone to drop from shock. Everyone raised their eyes to look, and they revealed a wisp of understanding when they saw Xixi who stood by Bai Wanqing’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Bai Clan, Xixi was simply a little she-devil that gave everyone a headache. She was unruly, mischievous, and loved to cause trouble everywhere, and she even dared to make fun of the Patriarch. But it just so happened that no matter if it was the Patriarch or the Grand Elder, they were extremely fond of her, and they treasured her to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If anyone dared to bully Xixi, then the consequences were unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the very least, Bai Gunan had deep experience. All those years ago when Xixi was still young, he’d merely slapped her on the head once, yet he was hung on a tree and whipped by his father. Moreover, his father wouldn’t stop no matter who persuaded his father. So it caused him to hide far away upon seeing this little girl as he was deeply afraid of suffering calamity once more…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the center of the martial practice grounds, Bai Jingchen heard Xixi as well. Especially when he heard the words ‘dirty old man,’ the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but twitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi who stood before Bai Jingchen acutely noticed this scene, and he couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a kid! You even dare to laugh! Receive my fist!” Bai Jingchen suddenly roared before smashing his fist at Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

Everywhere it passed, time was destroyed while chaos raged, and it seemed to be extremely simple, yet Chen Xi felt a suffocating aura assaulting his face as he stood there and even breathing became difficult. The space all around him was being shattered, and it even affected his soul.</span></p>

He held the Talisman Armament in his hand while his Immortal Energy rumbled, and it developed into a boundless divine ray of talisman markings that caused him to seem like an emperor of the sword that controlled and deduced the profundities of creation.</span></p>

Instantly, boundless space was destroyed, and it actually crushed open an enormous black hole. From within the blackhole, everyone could see numerous stars, unknown planes, and a variety of spaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a spatial blackhole created from space being torn apart to the limit.</span></p>

Once one was swept into these blackholes, then it was possible that the person would never be able to find the way back and might even be directly minced apart by the space-time tempests within the blackhole.</span></p>

He felt the force of that punch charge into his body like a group of wild horses that ran wild after escaping their restraints, and it shook his internal organs to the point of almost being turned upside down. Every single inch of his flesh felt as if it was suddenly pierced by needles, and he instantly felt pain that felt as if the world was spinning and almost knocked him out.</span></p>

A mouthful of blood suddenly sprayed out from his mouth, causing his countenance to instantly turn pale and almost translucent.</span></p>

He’s obviously bullying Chen Xi!” Xixi frowned and spoke with both worry and anger.</span></p>

If your Big Brother Chen Xi can’t pass this test, then it’ll probably be difficult for him to go against Bing Shitian.” Bai Wanqing’s expression was calm as she held Xixi’s hand and said in a low voice, “Stay here obediently, understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xixi couldn’t help but shiver and nod sulkily when she saw her mother reveal such a rare expression of seriousness.</span></p>

The might of this sword strike is almost equivalent to an expert at the 7</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;level of the Earthly Immortal Realm. But it’s far too inferior if you want to go against Bing Shitian!” At this moment, Bai Jingchen’s expression was solemn, and his eyes on his rugged and dignified face opened and closes swiftly like lightning while he was filled with an overbearing aura of supremacy that shook the hearts of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi took a deep breath and tried his best to recover his injuries. The Dark Parasol Sapling in his Blackhole World emanated an expanse of extremely blazing misty green radiance, and strands of vast and pure Immortal Energy surged madly out of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?” Bai Jingchen’s brows raised as he noticed that Chen Xi’s injuries were actually recovering at an unbelievable speed, and he instantly understood that this little fellow probably possessed some sort of healing treasure.</span></p>

However, his eyes were filled with battle intent that was dense and burning like lava, and his entire body was like a treasured sword that was stored in its box yet had left its sheath and shot into the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In practically an instant, he completely eliminated the force of Bai Jingchen’s punch that remained in his body.</span></p>

I underestimated your ability. But this second punch isn’t so simple. It might leave behind a heavy injury that’s difficult to repair, so are you sure you want to receive it?” Bai Jingchen roared with laughter while his entire body emanated an overbearing aura that heavy like a mountain and lofty like the sky. He seemed like an ancient god that had awoken, and merely his imposing aura shocked everyone to the point they found it difficult to breathe.</span></p>
