His voice was light, yet resounded out like thunder, and it struck directly into the hearts of everyone present within the hall to the point it seemed able to be heard by the deaf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you are the most outstanding talents in the younger generation of my Darchu Dynasty. You’ve experienced three tests and have become eminent from over 50,000 people, and your future accomplishments are limitless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From today onward, I’ll arrange all 96 of you to undergo one on one battles.”</span></p>

So Emperor Chu’s words possessed great meaning within them!</span></p>

You four have relied on external sources of strength to pass through the layers of tests, and your own strengths are unable to compare with the others. All four of you don’t have to participate in the final test.”</span></p>

This indirectly showed the overbearing methods of Emperor Chu as the ruler of a dynasty. Since he said one was inferior then one was inferior, and he would utterly not give anyone the chance to chatter about with explanations!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter if it was those Earthly Immortal Realm experts or Chen Xi and the remaining 95 participants, everyone present was shocked in their hearts and became even more cautious and reserved.</span></p>

These 48 will each be able to obtain five million Nascent Condensation Pills.” Emperor Chu’s voice resounded out in the entire hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span></p>

To Core Disciples of ancient sects, they were still capable of obtaining five million Nascent Condensation Pills by accumulating it for a year or two, but a heaven-rank magic treasure personally refined by Emperor Chu wasn’t something that anyone could obtain!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It was common knowledge that besides possessing an unfathomable cultivation, Emperor Chu was a grandmaster in equipment refinement that had attained perfection in his skills. Exactly how shocking would a heaven-rank magic treasure refined by him be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the might of a heaven-rank magic treasure could only be brought out completely by a cultivator at the Rebirth Realm, but this wasn’t able to affect the fervor in the hearts of everyone present here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because practically all of them had attained the perfection-stage of the Golden Core Realm since long ago, and if it wasn’t for the sake of participating in the Allstar Meeting, a large portion of them would have easily advanced to the Rebirth Realm long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, all of them were extremely moved when Emperor Chu said he would bestow these heaven-rank magic treasures upon them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it’s bestowed by his Majesty, then it’s surely a top-grade heaven-rank magic treasure. 24 people equals to 20 top-grade heaven-rank magic treasures. Such extravagance is something only his Majesty is capable of.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looks like his Majesty is attaching extreme importance to the disciples of the Allstar Meeting this time. Even I can’t help but be envious towards such rewards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the Earthly Immortal Realm experts were shocked by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor Chu seemed as if he’d utterly not noticed the shock of everyone present, and he continued. “These 24 will battle once more, and the remaining 12 will be able to obtain a Dao Insight Origin Pill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dao Insight Origin Pill!?</span></p>

Such rewards were truly too generous, and it was simply something had only happened for the first time in a few thousand years, it was a new mark in the annals of history!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to remind all of you that the two people amongst these 12 that show the worst display will be directly eliminated, and the remaining 10 people will be able to continue in the next round of the battles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi and the other 96 participants seemed as if they were splashed with a pail of cold water, and they sobered up from their fervor. These round after round of battles sounded simple, yet its brutality was surely extremely horrifying. It was still too early to be excited and feel anticipation now, as it wasn’t certain who’d be able to walk on this path until the end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor Chu swept everyone with his gaze and continued. “The disciples that enter into the final 10 will be able to enter the Dragon Transformation Pool to cultivate for three months. The further in front your ranking is, the more benefits you will obtain in the Dragon Transformation Pool. The disciples ranked in the top three will also be able to choose any Dao Grade martial technique or Divine Ability from the treasure vault of my Darchu Dynasty’s Imperial Family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even those Earthly Immortal Realm experts couldn’t sit still, and they opened their eyes wide open with expressions of disbelief on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon energy within the Dragon Transformation Pool was already a first class precious treasure in the heavens and the earth, and cultivators that cultivated within it would be able to obtain heaven defying benefits that were similar to being reborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this wasn’t the end of it, the disciples that ranked in the top three of the Allstar Meeting were even able to choose any Dao Grade martial technique of Divine Ability? That was the treasure vault of the Darchu Dynasty, and it contained the top martial techniques that had been accumulated for countless years. Any single one of them was sufficient to be taken as an ultimate treasure in a large clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This… How can they be allowed to choose anything? That’s the foundation of my Huangfu Clan’s rule of the world! How can it be allowed to be distributed to the outside world?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, even the Wise King, the Warlord, the Just King, and the Governing King were shocked, and they didn’t dare believe this was real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though they were extremely shocked in their hearts, no one dared voice out ant questions. Because the person that said all this was the supreme emperor of the Darchu Dynasty, the existence that ruled the world, one that never changes his words, one that didn’t allow defiance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, all of you temporarily enter the Silken Mountainriver Diagram to meditate and work hard to make preparations for the battles.” As soon as he finished speaking, a painting had suddenly appeared in Emperor Chu’s hand before it rolled open, and the scene of Mountains and rivers that rose and fell and a myriad of phenomena that surged with vast and unparalleled Immortal Energy could be vaguely scene on the painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silken Mountainriver Diagram!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of all the Earthly Immortal Realm experts present lit up and revealed a wisp of fervor. This was another Immortal Artifact that possessed extraordinary effects, and it wasn’t the slightest bit inferior to the Silken Palace that they resided in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, it had a universe of its own within it, and it was like a minor world. When one cultivated for a year within it, only a single day would have passed in the outside world, causing it to be an absolutely formidable Immortal Artifact. Not to mention Earthly Immortal Realm experts, even true Heavenly Immortals would probably be extremely envious of such a treasure.</span></p>

He actually took out the Silken Mountainriver Diagram to allow them to cultivate within it. Such good fortune is simply enviable!”</span></p>

But it occurred in the Dark Reverie and is unrelated to us, so there’s no need for everyone to be worried. When the time comes, all of you will naturally understand everything.”</span></p>

Even though Emperor Chu didn’t say what it was, since it was capable of being called a ‘major event,’ then it surely couldn’t be underestimated.</span></p>

If a major event were to happen there, then perhaps it would be a great upheaval that involved all the three dimensions.</span></p>

Since we’ve gathered here today, why don’t we seize this opportunity to drink wine while discussing the Dao?” Emperor Chu spoke out and interrupted the thoughts of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re naturally extremely honored to be able to listen to your Majesty’s truth of the Dao!” All of the Earthly Immortal Realm experts were greatly delighted. Emperor Chu’s cultivation was unfathomable, and his strength was exceedingly high and could look down upon the world. So, being able to exchange their knowledge in cultivation with him was extremely beneficial to their future endeavors to overcome the heavenly tribulations. Thus, how could they not be happy that they had the chance to discuss the Dao with Emperor Chu?</span></p>

So cultivating here was absolutely much more effective than consuming the Sky Jadeliquid Pills.</span></p>

Comparatively speaking, this Silken Mountainriver Diagram seemed to be more formidable than the Mansion in my jade pendant. Moreover, this place is filled with spirit energy and a trace of Immortal Energy, and it’s something the world of the stars is incapable of comparing to as well. But the might of the Mansion seems to not be as simple as what I’ve seen. If I have the chance, I have to ask Senior Ji Yu about exactly what quality treasure the Mansion is…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sized up his surroundings for a short moment before sitting down cross-legged, and then he held his breath in deep concentration to maintain an empty state of the mind before he started cultivating.</span></p>

The sounds of his Shaman Energy colliding with his bones rumbled like the sound of the Grand Dao, and the skin and flesh on his entire body swiftly underwent a transformation.</span></p>

He had to make the nine Shaman Markings on his back produce a unique link with the heavens and the earth as only in this way would he have the chance of charging into the next realm.</span></p>
