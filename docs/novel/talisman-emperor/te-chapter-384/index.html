 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the third test of the Allstar Meeting, a test of 3,600 people competing to obtain 100 places. Not only would those that succeed be able to enter the next round of the tests, they would even be able to obtain a Dao Grade martial technique from the divine throne, and it could be said to be killing two birds with one stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, those that failed only had a single outcome, to be eliminated!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because they knew that if they didn’t possess sufficient strength, then not only would they be unable to occupy a divine throne from being the first to make a move, they would instead draw death onto themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this silence didn’t continue for long.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this scene, the eyes of many people became indeterminate, but in the end, no one dared to rashly say something. Because they knew that no matter if it was in terms of strength or the powers standing behind them, it was sufficient to support these people to sit where they sat without the slightest obstruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason was that these young experts were the publicly acknowledged top geniuses of the Darchu Dynasty’s cultivation world, leading figures in the younger generation that were exceedingly dazzling. Under these circumstances, who would dare go against these people?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In only an instant, seven of the 100 divine thrones were already occupied.</span></p>

One was a violet haired young man with a cold expression and a thin figure, and strands of lightning arcs appeared as his eyes opened and closed, whereas the other was a grinning young fatty with a bloated figure, and they kept an extremely low profile. But since they were able to be in the first batch that seized a divine throne and didn’t encounter the covetous gazes of others, their strengths were surely extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two people were actually able to rival Huangfu Changtian and the others… There are really numerous experts in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi sighed with emotion in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, you arrived slightly late and perhaps you don’t know those two people. They’re called Yu Xuanchen and Ling Yu. Both of them possess extremely extraordinary strengths and are disciples that were personally taught by old freaks that live in seclusion from the world.” The nearby Wang Daoxu explained. “Early on the first and second tests, the two of them had revealed abilities that surpassed the others, causing their strengths to have already obtained the acknowledgement of most people. Thus, they were able to safely seize a divine throne.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi came to a sudden understanding. He’d once heard many people say before the Allstar Meeting began that because of the Dragon Transformation Pool, numerous old freaks that lived in seclusion from the world had sent out their disciples to participate in the Allstar Meeting this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, this Yu Xuanchen and Ling Yu were outstanding disciples taught by two old freaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Let’s make a move together and seize this moment that everyone is still filled with worry. Otherwise, we’ll probably fall into a great chaotic battle.” Young Master Zhou spoke out abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi raised his eyes and swept his gaze towards his surroundings. He saw that amongst the people by his side, besides Zhen Liuqing and Huangfu Qingying who’d made a move first, An Qianyu, Wang Daoxu, Hua Mobei, Wang Zhenfeng, and Young Master Zhou were already prepared to make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi turned around to look at Fan Yunlan by his side, and when she nodded to indicate she was prepared, he agreed right away. “Alright, let’s make a move together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation at this moment was precisely as Young Master Zhou had said, most of the people were filled with worries and no one dared make a move first for a long time as they were deeply afraid of becoming a target of all that was surrounded and annihilated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, if he relied on his strength and the strength of the others at this moment to move out jointly, there would probably be no one that dared obstruct them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with Zhen Liuqing and Huangfu Qingying who had already openly indicated their support for him, Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, and the others would surely not dare obstruct them at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish! Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without anymore hesitation, Chen Xi and the others moved out, transforming into wisps of flowing lights that flashed towards the divine thrones around the sacrificial altar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this, most people present had acted just as Chen Xi had expected, and they didn’t obstruct Chen Xi’s group due to their apprehension towards Chen Xi’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before Chen Xi could heave a sigh of relief, Fan Yunlan’s enraged cry sounded out abruptly from behind him, causing his heart to jerk as he swiftly raised his head to look over. He saw Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, and Xiao Linger had torn through the sky and intended to stop and kill Fan Yunlan with all their might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re courting death!” Chen Xi suddenly stopped moving in mid air before turning around to charge back towards Fan Yunlan’s side, and his expression was already icy cold and indifferent to the extreme. At the critical moment, these fellows still didn’t know what was good for them and suddenly interfered, and it had already completely enraged him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit, these ignorant bastards!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chen, I’ll come assist you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Young Master Zhou and the others noticed this scene and shouted out furiously in succession before they turned around with the intention of charging over, but they were stopped by Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, go seize a divine throne first. Leave everything else to me! Believe in me!” Chen Xi’s voice was resolute, and it emanated an indisputable feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. You be careful. You must persist until the end of the competition!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw Chen Xi’s attitude was so resolute, Young Master Zhou and the others revealed solemn expressions as they knew that they couldn’t say anything further at this time, and they immediately turned around to charge towards a divine throne that was near the sacrificial altar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, and Xiao Linger successfully stopped Fan Yunlan, they didn’t continue making a move against her, and they stood in midair as they sneered with their arms crossed before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw this scene, Chen Xi instantly understood that these people were making a feint. They were going against Fan Yunlan on the surface, but it was actually for the sake of obstructing Chen Xi from seizing a divine throne!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was extremely easy to understand why they did this. If they directly made a move against him, then they would completely offend Zhen Liuqing and Huangfu Qingying. But it was different if they made a move against Fan Yunlan because everyone was able to discern that Fan Yunlan wasn’t acquainted with anyone here besides Chen Xi, and it was even to the extent that very few people even knew her identity. So they utterly didn’t have to worry about offending anyone or facing any pressure from going against Fan Yunlan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, through this action, they were also able to implicate Chen Xi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry…” Fan Yunlan spoke in a low voice, and she had a slightly sorry expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to say anything further. This enmity had to be dealt with sooner or later. Now that I speak of it, it was because of me that you were involved.” Chen Xi patted Fan Yunlan on her shoulder as he consoled, and when he turned around to look at Huangfu Chongming and the others, his face was already covered in killing intent.</span></p>

For the sake of a beauty, you’re even willing to give up the Martial Dao Divine Throne.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Moxuan and Xiao Linger laughed endlessly with ridicule as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi clenched his hand and the pitch black and lusterless Talisman Armament flashed out into appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Om!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He understood that he’d offended many people indeed. Besides Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, and Xiao Linger, there was also Liu Fengchi, Man Hong, and the others, and all these people would surely not allow him to easily seize a Martial Dao Divine Throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coupled with their actions of attacking Fan Yunlan, it had caused him to arouse killing intent in his heart, and he wasn’t willing to continue keeping a low profile. Since a battle couldn’t be avoided, then he would kill to his heart’s content. What was there to be afraid of?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This fellow…” As she looked at the figure that held the Talisman Armament in his hand and stood proudly in midair, Fan Yunlan’s beautiful eyes went red and were covered in a layer of watery mist as her nose ached. Chen Xi being able to fight for her caused her to feel that her life wasn’t lived in vain even if she died in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignorant fool!” Huangfu Chongming, Lin Moxuan, and Xiao Linger laughed coldly without end. As far as they were concerned, Chen Xi’s actions were like the final roar emitted by a beast that had fallen into a hopeless situation, and it didn’t have the slightest deterrent force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This person, Chen Xi, is really a loyal person, and such courage it truly difficult to come by.”</span></p>

It’s the easiest for geniuses like this to die early. At this moment, without the protection of Zhen Liuqing and Huangfu Qingying, let me see how he winds up the matter today.”</span></p>

Every single one of the people that were capable of arriving here are renowned experts, yet this fellow actually proclaimed war to all of his enemies. He’s really overestimating his ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when Chen Xi’s voice just resounded out, the surroundings of the square instantly exploded into an uproar as numerous gazes looked towards Chen Xi who was in midair. Some gazes contained admiration, some hostility, and some contained disdain, yet most people sighed and didn’t look favorably upon him.</span></p>
