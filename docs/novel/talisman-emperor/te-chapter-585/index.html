It seemed like boundless Grand Daos were branded on it, causing it to emit a golden brilliance of divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the instant Chen Xi’s mind immersed itself into the flower petal, he felt his mind drone before his entire body seemed to have entered a chaotic world that had no heavens or earth, no stellar bodies, and no landscape, and it was an expanse of grey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span></p>

It was a green colored sapling that was extremely verdant, delicate, and young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a terrifying aura suddenly suffused out as soon as it appeared, and it was formidable to the point this world that was an expanse of grey trembled and was boundlessly terrified.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene seemed like nine gorgeous and resplendent suns hung on a branch, and they formed an extremely miraculous lotus flower. It seemed as if it possessed life, and it looked down upon the gods, crushed the ages, and was dignified to the extreme.</span></p>

At this instant, boundless clear air rose and transformed into the sky while boundless muddy air sank to transform into the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shape of a world had been born just like this!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some were only fist sized, yet transformed into a flowing ray of light and vanished as soon as they leaped out.</span></p>

All of them seemed to possess intelligence and vast divine might, and they either soared into the sky, plunged into the group, or directly transformed into mountains, rivers, and seas… All of them vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These wouldn’t be the living beings that were born from within the chaos, right!?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Xi gasped. It was the first time he’s seen such a vast scene, and he was shocked to the point his heart was unable to calm down for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, his field of vision flashed, and the scene before his eyes instantly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous enormous mountains that were extremely ancient lay dormant on the ground, and they were luxuriant and towering. The landscape was gorgeous with a myriad of beings growing upon it. Enormous birds sometimes flashed through and covered the sky, casting a large shadow onto the earth; there were also terrifying ferocious beasts standing on the peaks of the mountains while roaring at the room, and there were even various enormous poisonous insects roaming about, causing it to seem extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire world seemed extremely alike to the primeval times of legend. Primeval ferocious beasts roamed freely while peerless flying beasts flashed about. Everything in the world was in a state of chaos that was without order or rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a beast roar that shook the heavens and the earth sounded out, and it shook Chen Xi to the point he felt a piercing pain in his eardrums while his soul almost collapsed. When he opened his eyes to look over, he saw numerous primeval ferocious beasts that only existed in legend were flashing over explosively either in the sky or on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everywhere they passed, mountain after mountain was trampled on to the point of collapse, river after river was incinerated to the point of drying up, and their might simple caused even the heavens and the earth to tremble endlessly and seem as if doomsday had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-d12e"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiongqi, Taowu, Feiyi, Jiuxiao, Zhuhuai, Ya’yu…” Chen Xi was astounded as he recognized the identity of these ferocious beasts of the primeval times. They were actually the monstrous ferocious beasts that were renowned during the primeval times.</span></span><a href="#footnote-d12e">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These ferocious beasts were reputed as the nine ferocities of the primeval times. Every single one of them possessed terrifying strength that could tear gods apart, and they commanded the wind and clouds while looking down upon the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, these nine ferocious beasts were flashing towards him in unison, and they terrified Chen Xi to the point he intended to turn around and flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the next moment, he noticed that he was only a strand of consciousness, and he was located on a leaf of that divine lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, the target of these nine ferocious beasts was this divine lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine rays of light illuminated the sky as the divine lotus stretched out a verdant branch that was like an iron chain of order, and it soared through the sky to directly penetrate the ferocious beast Qiongqi that had blood red wings and seemed partially like an ox and tiger. Blood sprayed through the entire sky as the vital blood in the entire body of the Qiongqi was absorbed by the verdant branch, and then it instantly transformed into ash that vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ferocity of the other ferocious beasts increased instead when they saw this, and the fur on their entire bodies surged with divine light as they executed their respective innate Dao Arts, causing the wind and the clouds in the entire sky to enter into a state of chaos as they clawed towards the divine lotus in unison once more. Even gods would probably only be able to flee in panic when facing such attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The divine lotus didn’t dodge or move to avoid these attacks. Its nine layers of petals bloomed layer by layer like nine scorching suns launching into the sky, and they flew out to collide with the attacks of these ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An enormous bang that shook the heavens resounded out while Chen Xi felt a piercing pain in his eyes. When he opened his eyes once more, the earth in an area of 50,000km was covered in desolation and without the slightest sign of life, whereas those numerous ferocious beasts had already vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the divine lotus was still rooted in the ground and stood towering on the earth. Its branches had become even more verdant and crystalline, whereas its petals even developed countless dense and profound striations that were like numerous kingdoms, and they were suffused with eternal divine brilliance and immortal radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, a wave of emotional sighs of comprehension silently slid past Chen Xi’s mind. “At the beginning of the primeval times, the world was covered in chaos. There were nine ferocities that emerged, they devoured the essence of the heavens, fed on the marrow of the earth, and their roars shook the world while their claws tore the universe apart. I slaughtered all of them and obtained their innate Dao Arts, and then I fused them into the Dao Art of nine transformations…”</span></p>

Spindrifts surged and transformed into numerous savage ghosts that howled as they charged forward successively, and they were extremely terrifying.</span></p>

The myriad of waves are like a tide that is impossible to resist by both ghost and god…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Dao Art inheritance of the Myriad Netherwave Palm.</span></p>

He knew very well that the Allheaven Truth wasn’t a Dao Art, yet it was something that was at the essence of Dao Arts. It was the most primitive, most basic, and simplest, and it was the source of all the Dao Arts in the Nine Radiance Sword Sect!</span></p>

Besides that, strands of chaotic qi suddenly effused out from the divine lotus, and it rose from the ground to ascend towards the depths of the universe while stepping on the Laws of the Grand Daos and emitting boundless light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous rivers of stars fell down as infinite stars circled around the divine lotus, and as they circulated around the divine lotus, they emitted rumbling that was sufficient to shake the universe.</span></p>

It was like an exalted figure was standing majestically within the universe while the heavens and the earth, the universe, the 3,000 worlds, and the myriad of minor worlds were all circulating around it and were born because of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right at this moment, a pair of eyes suddenly opened up in the darkness at the depths of the universe, and it swept over before instantly locking onto the divine lotus.</span></p>

On the other hand, the divine lotus seemed as if it had suffered a heavy injury, and its branches and leaves shattered apart while its stem turned dim and lusterless. The nine flower petals on it were even shattered and dispersed one by one by a mysterious force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the end, merely a single petal transformed into a ray of flowing light that penetrated through boundless space in the blink of an eye, and it fled from the universe to descend into the Mortal Dimension and vanish without a trace.</span></p>
