Not to mention everyone present here at the scene, even Earthly Immortal Realm experts would probably not dare believe their eyes when facing such a terrifying scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was a genuine strand of will of a Heavenly Immortal!</span></p>

The unparalleled visual impact from this caused everyone present to be shocked to the point their scalps went numb and they were rendered speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also some people with extremely discerning gazes that noticed the subtlety within all this. They understood that it wasn’t Chen Xi who destroyed the Heavenly Immortal’s Will but the wisp of white light that was shot out explosively by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they hadn’t pried into what the white light actually was, they were extremely sure in their hearts that it was absolutely an extraordinarily formidable treasure that was more formidable than a Quasi Immortal Artifact!</span></p>

That was the will of a Heavenly Immortal! How could it possibly be annihilated by a Rebirth Realm cultivator!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re doomed! Even the Heavenly Immortal Jade Talisman has failed. Is there anyone in Primeval City that can subdue him?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

He drew the bow fully before the bowstring shook repeatedly, and numerous shapeless arrows show out explosively like divine rays of light that penetrated through the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dao of Archery possessed unparalleled speed and terrifying penetration force. At this moment, when Chen Xi drew his bow and released the arrows formed from his own Shaman Energy, the terrifying penetration force that exploded out from them directly blasted the bodies of six Shang Clan disciples apart, and even their Soul Core’s were unable to narrowly escape and were obliterated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A slaughter suddenly started, causing the Shang Clan disciples to be jolted back to their senses, and then their expressions went pale. Never had they imagined that in the short period they were shocked, there were actually six people from their side that had died successively. Moreover, the scene of their deaths was extremely horrifying, as all of them were blasted into pieces and mush that covered the ground, and there wasn’t the slightest chance for them to seize the body of another to achieve rebirth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood sprayed into the sky, and it impacted the hearts of the distant spectators to the point they were horrified to the extreme.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that this fellow, Chen Xi, is really going to uproot the Shang Clan by himself today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll ask one last time, where’s Shang Kun?” Chen Xi’s calm voice suddenly reverberated in the heavens and the earth, and it entered clearly into the ears of everyone present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, many people recovered from their shock about why Chen Xi would become furious and bloodthirsty.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So it’s for his women!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of these people had seen the scene of Chen Xi annihilating Lu Tianze with their own two eyes, so they naturally found out from Lu Tianze that Shang Kun had captured two young women from the Darchu Dynasty with the intention of cultivating a devil technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When faced with such an incident, Chen Xi had only replied with a single sentence.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they die, I’ll bury the entire Shang Clan with them.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, the people that heard these words utterly didn’t dare believe it, and they thought Chen Xi had gone mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, they’d completely believed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the will of a Heavenly Immortal was incapable of obstructing Chen Xi’s footsteps, so how would the Shang Clan go against Chen Xi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot, do you think I’d tell you?” Shang Que calmed down instead when facing Chen Xi’s threats, and he gritted his teeth and said, “Even if all of us die, it’s impossible for you to find out where the Young Master is. Conversely, once the Young Master cultivates the Chaotic Devilbody successfully, he’ll surely annihilate you and the disciples of the Darchu Dynasty to take revenge for us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Since it’s like that, I’ll annihilate all of you and destroy this palace. I don’t believe I’ll be unable to force Shang Kun out!” Chen Xi wouldn’t be threatened by a few words from Shang Que, and he grunted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he’d already put away the Staruin Bow in his hand before stretching his hand out with a grabbing motion, causing the Grand Astral Palm to soar through the sky once again, and it blotted out the sky as it fiercely slapped down at Shang Que.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill! Attack together. We must persist until the Young Master completes his closed door cultivation, otherwise all of us are doomed!” Shang Que revealed a ruthless expression as he looked at the terrifying palm that descended from the sky, and he let out a sharp roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the critical moment of life and death, these Shang Clan disciples didn’t dare have anymore wishful thoughts, and they gritted their teeth before exerting their strongest attacks towards Chen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle erupted once again!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Waves of explosions, rumbling, and roars were intertwined together as they resounded and shook the entire world, and it caused the area to seem as if it had returned to the time of the beginning of the world when the gods were on the bloody battlefield of their expedition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who could ever imagine that one of the parties in such a great and horrifying battle was merely a single person?</span></p>

Even then, they still felt terrified and extremely shocked as they witnessed this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, more and more cultivators sensed the occurrence of this battle that shook the heavens and the earth, causing them to flash over from all directions, and they exclaimed endlessly with shock when they found out about everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the extent that some people who couldn’t bear the sight of Chen Xi had no choice but to admit how ferocious and formidable Chen Xi was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, an expanse of nimbus clouds that were shaped like a sword flew over from the horizon. It was an entire 3km in length and emitted a terrifying sword aura as it directly slashed into the ball of light that exploded out from the battle between both sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

It was like a god was drumming the skies, and it shook everyone to the point their ears droned and they felt dazed.</span></p>

He seemed to have suffered a heavy injury, yet his expression was indifferent and calm while the imposing aura emitted from his body hadn’t weakened in the slightest, and his battle intent blazed like flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, most of the Shang Clan disciples had actually perished, and only a little over 10 remained. Moreover, all of them were bathed in blood and in sorry states.</span></p>

Only 10 plus of the 50 disciples of my Shang Clan remain!” As he looked at the few remaining companions by his side, Shang Que’s eyes almost split open and bled tears of blood, and he roared repeatedly as he was already furious to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was unable to bear such heavy losses, and even the Young Master Shang Kun who was in closed door cultivation was unable to bear such a loss. If news of this matter was sent back to the clan, it would surely cause a mighty uproar.</span></p>

Chen Xi, how about you give me face and let them off?” Right at this moment, a figure appeared from within the expanse of nimbus clouds, and he walked over step by step from midair as if he was walking on even ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His footsteps had a profound rhythm that resonated with the heavens and the earth, and it seemed as if he’d fused into one with it!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a formidable man that seemed as if he’d fused into nature itself. His entire body emitted an indescribable aura that seemed fierce and swift like a sword yet vast like the rain, and it imposed an extremely great pressure onto others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shang Que frowned instead when he saw this man, and he wasn’t grateful in the slightest. After all, Feng Jianbai was the leader of the Feng Clan, and their relationship with the Shang Clan was one of competition, strife, and mutual caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Feng Jianbai suddenly appearing here at this moment looked as if he’d come to assist the Shang Clan, yet Shang Que didn’t think so in his heart because no help in this world came for free.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Feng Jianbai surely possesses other motives!</span></p>

He was a matchlessly handsome man with a slender figure, his footsteps were steady while his bearing was pure and light. If one didn’t pay attention, one would entirely be unable to sense his existence because he seemed to have fused into one with the heavens and the earth.</span></p>

Before today, his name firmly occupied the ranking of the first on the Warsoul Tablet, and no one was capable of shaking it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, even though his position was occupied by Chen Xi, yet it utterly didn’t prevent everyone from feeling fearful and reverent towards him.</span></p>

He wouldn’t fight under normal circumstances, yet once he did, he would surely be coldblooded and ruthless, causing it to be almost impossible for his opponent to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people caused others to have a deep impression of them at the first glance, and others would feel they were extremely extraordinary and would sooner or later accomplish great things. Obviously, Feng Jianbai was such a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, there was always a rumor in Primeval City. The rumor said that Feng Jianbai’s strength had broken through to the 6</span><sup>th</sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"> tempering of the Rebirth Realm long ago, and he’d attained the perfection-stage of the Rebirth Realm. It was precisely this rumor that caused all the cultivators who entered Primeval City to feel extremely fearful of him.</span></p>

Who’re you? Do I know you?” But Chen Xi’s expression didn’t change in the slightest when he saw Feng Jianbai appear abruptly, and when he heard what Feng Jianbai said, he even felt slightly amused, causing his voice to carry a trace of disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stirred as no one imagined that Chen Xi would actually be so ferocious at a time like this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even take Feng Jianbai seriously. Could it be that he isn’t afraid that Feng Jianbai would join forces with the Shang Clan against him?</span></p>

But do you think you are one?” Chen Xi’s eyes went cold as he replied with a question, and he continued before Feng Jianbai could reply. “Speak frankly. Did you come here this time to stand up for the Shang Clan?” Chen Xi’s voice was like a thunderclap that shook the heavens and the earth, and it carried an oppressive aura.</span></p>
