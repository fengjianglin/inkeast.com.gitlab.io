 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 871 - A Question</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“You are truly quite insane. After becoming a Martial Lord, those who can make one rank of breakthrough within several years are already not simple at all. Yet you’ve gotten two ranks of cultivation within such a short period of time! How can others even compete with that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not to mention your two friends who want to catch up to you, even I’m depressed,” Chun Wu said as she curled her lips after hearing Su Mei’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Chun Wu, don’t joke with me! Your junior has so many enemies. If I don’t raise my cultivation quickly, I won’t be able to protect myself!” Chu Feng smiled embarrassedly, then quickly changed topic and asked, “Senior Chun Wu, any news on Senior Qiushui?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui has already returned, and she has already gotten the Holy Medicine of Dragon and Phoenix. Right now, my master is concocting the medicine in seclusion, so you don’t need to worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But Senior Qiushui knew you went to the Winter Plains. Afraid something would happen to you, after she returned with the Holy Medicine of Dragon and Phoenix, she went back to the Winter Plains to search for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You said Senior Qiushui went back to the Winter Plains?” Chu Feng’s expression changed when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Burning Heaven Church had now been discovered by the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Not only could the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago enter the Burning Heaven Church, there was even a terrifying woman inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no longer a serene paradise, and instead, an extremely dangerous place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, you’ve made it quite troublesome for me!” But just at that moment, Qiushui Fuyan’s voice rang out. At the same time, the Holy Daughter of the Burning Heaven Church appeared before Chu Feng and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, you’ve returned?” Chu Feng’s heart which had just tensed up returned to being at ease immediately after he saw Qiushui Fuyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve not only returned, I’ve also heard what you did~” Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What he did? Senior Qiushui, what did Junior Chu Feng do at the Winter Plains?” Chun Wu was immediately intrigued. As for Zi Ling, Su Ru, and Su Mei, they too cast their curious gazes at Qiushui Fuyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This boy has done quite a huge thing!” Qiushui Fuyan didn’t conceal anything as she narrated what occurred between Chu Feng and the Stone Sword Sect in the Winter Plains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that, Chu Feng also learnt that Qiushui Fuyan had truly returned to the Winter Plains, and she had also returned to the Burning Heaven Church. However, when she was there, Chu Feng had already left, and the woman had already left as well. There was not a single person at the Burning Heaven Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why Qiushui Fuyan only knew what happened between Chu Feng and the Stone Sword Sect, but not what happened between Chu Feng and the Third Immortal—and the mysterious woman—in the Burning Heaven Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Qiushui Fuyan discovered there was someone who intruded into the Burning Heaven Church and had done some damages, she then used a technique outsiders knew nothing about and changed the Arctic Killing Formation, thus completely sealing the entrance to the Burning Heaven Church. Unless it were her or other higher echelons of the Burning Heaven Church, that seal could not be deactivated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Waa, Junior Chu Feng, even rank eight Martial Lords stand no chance against you! Then doesn’t that mean the next time you see that Murong Xun, you can give him a good beating and take revenge for what he did back then?” After hearing Qiushui Fuyan’s narrations, Chun Wu’s face was full of admiration, and one could also tell that she truly felt happy for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Chun Wu felt that, naturally, Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei felt even happier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were really too many enemies Chu Feng had right now, and like he said, only by quickly developing could he protect himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chun Wu, Zi Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, all of you return first. I have something I need to speak with Chu Feng alone,” said Qiushui Fuyan suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, Senior Qiushui, we’ll take our leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zi Ling and the others looked at each other when they heard that, then said their farewells with Qiushui Fuyan. However, before leaving, Zi Ling went close to Chu Feng’s ear and said with a low voice, “I, Sister Rou, and Sister Mei are waiting for you~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking, Zi Ling smiled charmingly, and with Su Rou, Su Mei, and Chun Wu, she entered the beautiful Misty Peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me.” After they left, Qiushui Fuyan moved and flew towards the vast sea region outside the Misty Peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Chu Feng, he closely followed. Qiushui Fuyan only stopped after they were a good distance from the Misty Peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, what do you want to discuss with me?” Chu Feng asked only after she stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, I have a question for you first. Is your rise in cultivation related to that Sacred Entity in the Burning Heaven Church?” Qiushui Fuyan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truthfully replying, Senior, that Sacred Entity has been taken by me, and my cultivation was also obtained from refining it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng concealed nothing and replied honestly because from the very beginning, he had never planned to hide that from her. Even if Qiushui Fuyan didn’t ask him, he would have told her on his own accord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You truly refined it? How much?” Qiushui Fuyan seemed a bit excited upon hearing Chu Feng’s response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I refined all of it. But, Senior, my body is a bit special, and for every rank of cultivation, I require an increasing amount of cultivation resources. So, even though the energy in the Sacred Entity was very powerful, it only allowed me to make a single rank of breakthrough,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, you’ve truly shocked me! Although I already knew your body was special, I didn’t expect you could even refine that Sacred Entity! That was something no one from the Burning Heaven Church could anything to!” After hearing Chu Feng’s words, Qiushui Fuyan didn’t blame Chu Feng at all. Instead, she was both surprised and cheerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, that was still something that belonged to your Burning Heaven Church, yet I refined it just like that. Don’t you blame me?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That thing is only useful for growing some medicinal plants, and it could only be used in the Burning Heaven Church. It couldn’t be moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Immortal Execution Archipelago had always wanted to take over the Burning Heaven Church. Even though they can’t deactivate the Arctic Killing Formation now, who can guarantee they won’t be able to in the future? As long as they can, that would mean the entire peak of medicinal plants would belong to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rather than giving such an advantage to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, it’s better to just let you refine it. Besides, you are no stranger,” Qiushui Fuyan said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing Qiushui Fuyan’s words, Chu Feng felt very happy as well because she truly cared about him. Yet, she clearly didn’t owe him anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. Chu Feng, the reason I called you out here was for something else. I just also asked about the Sacred Entity,” said Qiushui Fuyan suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, if there’s anything you want to ask, just go ahead. As long as I know about it, I won’t hide it from you,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has Huangfu Haoyue already gone insane?” Qiushui Fuyan asked.</span></p>
