 <p><strong> Chapter 2261 - The Disappeared Tomb</strong></p>
 <p>“I know, I know. That man held a silver spear and wore silver armor. He proclaimed himself to be from the Ancient Era’s War Clan. His name was Zhan Haichuan.” [1. Zhan → War/Battle Haichuan → Sea River.]</p>
 <p>“I’ve heard that Zhan Haichuan was the most famous existence to have appeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm in the last fifty thousand years. He is simply akin to a legend.”</p>
 <p>“However, not long after he became famous, he disappeared. From that point on, no one ever heard any news about him,” Xu Yiyi interrupted.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, he disappeared for a very long time. After he disappeared, everyone thought that he left the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, that is not the truth.”</p>
 <p>“Not long after our Sunset Cloud Valley’s second generation Valley Master succeeded the position of Valley Master, that expert who had once stood at the apex of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Lord Zhao Haichuan, once again appeared.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, due to a chance encounter, Lord Zhan Haichuan befriended our Sunset Cloud Valley’s second generation Valley Master.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Zhan Haichuan bestowed a lot of treasures to our Sunset Cloud Valley. He even taught our second generation Lord Valley Master the method to nurture our disciples, as well as how to choose elites.”</p>
 <p>“To tell you the truth, even our Sunset Cloud Valley’s mysterious protection technique, our Sunset Cloud Mysterious Technique, was not something created by our founder. Rather, it was given to us by Lord Zhan Haichuan.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Zhan Haichuan felt fond of the name of our Sunset Cloud Valley. As he just happened to possess a special mysterious technique that would give off an abnormal sign as if one had sunset clouds lingering around oneself should one master it, he felt that that mysterious technique suited our Sunset Cloud Valley.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, it is all thanks to Lord Zhan Haichuan that our Sunset Cloud Valley was able to obtain our prosperity today,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, is that for real? Why have I never heard of this before?” Xu Yiyi opened her mouth wide in shock. Astonishment filled her beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>After all, Zhan Haichuan was an individual with astonishing fame. As such, this was no small matter at all.</p>
 <p>In fact, even Elder Ning Shuang had an astonished expression on his face. It would seem that this was not something that everyone in the Sunset Cloud Valley knew about.</p>
 <p>“Lord Zhan Haichuan mentioned that it was best to keep this matter confidential. Other than the successive Valley Masters and during moments of necessity, it would be best to not mention this matter to anyone else.”</p>
 <p>“However, today, as I have a request for little friend Chu Feng, I would naturally have to be sincere. That is the reason why I have mentioned this matter,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“Wow! Chu Feng, your reputation is truly huge. This is something that even we didn’t know about before. Likely, even my master does not know about this. We were only able to know about this today thanks to you,” Xu Yiyi said happily.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, there are not many people that know about this matter right now. The few of us here are the only ones that know about it. Thus, we must keep this matter confidential,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master reminded everyone.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang said in unison.</p>
 <p>“I hope that little friend Chu Feng will help our Sunset Cloud Valley keep this matter confidential too,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said to Chu Feng. His tone was very polite.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, please rest assured. I will definitely not mention this matter to anyone,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“I trust little friend Chu Feng. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have told you about it,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Actually, Chu Feng being an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was only a part of the reason why the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master thought so highly of Chu Feng. Most importantly, it was because Chu Feng had cured his mother’s illness and saved her life.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, then, what happened after that?” Chu Feng asked. He knew that this matter was not resolved.</p>
 <p>“Actually, when our Sunset Cloud Valley’s second generation Valley Master became acquainted with Lord Zhan Haichuan, Lord Zhan Haichuan was already in his old age, and nearing the end of his life.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Zhan Haichuan said that he had been proud and aloof all his life, and had been unwilling to believe anyone. As such, he had never had a friend his entire life.”</p>
 <p>“He said that countless people would think about his inheritance, should he die. As such, he believed that he would not be able to escape his tomb being dug up.”</p>
 <p>“However, he did not mind any of that. After all, after death, everything would be gone. Even if what he had accumulated in his entire life was snatched away, what could he possibly do?”</p>
 <p>“Lord Zhan Haichuan only hoped that there would be people who would go and offer respects at his grave every year after he died,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“Although an exceptional expert like that would be looked up to by others his entire life, it is also destined that he would be lonely his entire life. Perhaps this might not have bothered him in the past, however, when one is about to die, it would naturally change one’s frame of mind.”</p>
 <p>“If I am not mistaken, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s second generation Valley Master must have been the person chosen by Zhan Haichuan to offer respects at his grave every year after his death, right?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng’s judgment is truly good,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master had confirmed Chu Feng’s guess, the gaze with which Xu Yiyi looked to Chu Feng was immediately filled with little stars. It was a gaze of adoration.</p>
 <p>It was not only her; even Elder Ning Shuang looked to Chu Feng with an admiring gaze. The reason for that was because he had been focused on listening the entire time, and hadn’t even bothered to think about where the story was going.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was thinking about all of that at the same time as he was listening. This sort of line of thought was truly not something that ordinary people possessed.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the tomb of that Lord Zhan Haichuan is located in the Sunset Cloud Valley?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Indeed,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master nodded. Then, he said, “After that, our Sunset Cloud Valley’s successive generations of Valley Masters would always go and offer their respects to Lord Zhan Haichuan’s grave every year.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, as per the instructions of our second generation’s Valley Master, we would always offer our respects toward the grave at least three times a year.”</p>
 <p>“However, at the time when our sixth generation Valley Master succeeded the position of Valley Master, a strange thing occurred. Lord Zhan Haichuan’s tomb disappeared,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“Disappeared?” Hearing those words, both Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang were astonished. Although Chu Feng had a relatively calm expression, there was also surprise in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Where was that tomb built? Could it have been discovered by someone and plundered?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That tomb was built in our Sunset Cloud Valley’s forbidden area. Other than our Sunset Cloud Valley’s successive generations of Valley Masters, no one else knew about this matter. Furthermore, no one else had the authority to enter that forbidden area.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, Lord Zhan Haichuan set up many spirit formations in the area. If one were to only offer respects to his tomb, it would be fine. However, if anyone tried to do anything to his tomb, they would trigger those spirit formations guarding the tomb.”</p>
 <p>“The spirit formations that Lord Zhan Haichuan left behind to guard his tomb are no small matter. If one were to trigger them, our Sunset Cloud Valley’s forbidden area would not even be able to withstand the spirit formations. However, our Sunset Cloud Valley’s forbidden area is still here. This means that no one has triggered those spirit formations,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“But, how could a tomb disappear by itself?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“According to our sixth generation Lord Valley Master, he had discovered things that were amiss before he tried to offer his respects to Lord Zhan Haichuan’s tomb.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, our sixth generation Lord Valley Master was determined that the tomb was still inside the forbidden area. Merely, due to the fact that Lord Zhan Haichuan’s tomb was too powerful, it might have disappeared because of some unforeseen event.”</p>
 <p>“However, since the tomb has disappeared, we are thus unable to offer our respects to it. Thus, I wish to request little friend Chu Feng’s assistance to see whether or not you might be able to find that tomb again,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“A tomb that could disappear? That is truly extraordinary. That tomb must have been personally built by that Lord Zhan Haichuan, right?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it was personally built by Lord Zhan Haichuan,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master nodded.</p>
 <p>“Something is definitely fishy regarding this,” Chu Feng started to ponder. The reason for that was because a tomb would not disappear without good cause. Chu Feng felt that it might be dangerous if he were to attempt to find the tomb.</p>
