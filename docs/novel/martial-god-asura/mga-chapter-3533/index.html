 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because Kong Tianhui resembled Wang Qiang that Chu Feng had a favorable impression of him. Perhaps this was also the reason why Chu Feng agreed to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were close friends that had been through life and death dangers together. To Chu Feng, Wang Qiang was an extremely important brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, what are the two of you chatting about?” Suddenly, the closed door suddenly opened. Li Ruochu had rushed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who allowed you in here?” Seeing the intruder, Kong Tianhui was immediately furious. He even released his killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, that’s my big sister,” Chu Feng said hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, so it’s actually big sister,” after Chu Feng spoke, Kong Tianhui immediately retrieved his furious expression. With a smile on his face, he said, “Big sister, you are truly beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young master Kong, is it possible to allow little brother Chu Feng and I some time alone to chat?” Li Ruochu asked with a beaming smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, of course. The two of you can chat, the two of you can chat. I will go out and get some fresh air,” with an eagerly attentive expression, Kong Tianhui rushed out, and even took the initiative to close the door behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, only Chu Feng and Li Ruochu remained in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This guy, is he a face-changing monster? How could he change his face this quickly?” Li Ruochu asked with a smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That guy is quite interesting,” Chu Feng looked to Li Ruochu. “How was your conversation with our clan chief?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng had returned together with Li Ruochu, the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Li Taiyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely, he coincidentally ran into Kong Tianhui’s provocation upon his return. Thus, Chu Feng had asked Li Ruochu and the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to not do anything, and went out to face Kong Tianhui himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the matter with Kong Tianhui was settled, the Li Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Li Ruochu and Li Taiyi went to find the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to discuss reconciliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Chu Feng was supposed to accompany them. Unfortunately, Kong Tianhui had continued to flit around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of that, Chu Feng had already realized that Kong Tianhui might have a request for him. Thus, he decided to move to an isolated place with Kong Tianhui to chat, whilst Li Ruochu and the others went to chat with the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should know your clan chief’s personality very well yourself. Disregarding whether or not Li Taiyi came, even if it were only our clan chief that spoke for reconciliation, he would definitely agree to it. Besides, Li Taiyi directly apologized to him,” Li Ruochu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, he had wanted to kill my clan chief. It's already letting him off very lightly with only an apology,” said Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Chu Feng was still resentful toward Li Taiyi’s actions, he was rather happy to learn that their Chu Heavenly Clan had reconciled with the Li Heavenly Clan. After all, both Li Yue’er and Li Ruochu belonged to the Li Heavenly Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed, he was let off very lightly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That said, I must tell you this: that old fellow is sincere in his apology this time around. He even went as far as to kneel to your clan chief. Think about it; he’s such a conceited person, yet he was able to do that. That is most definitely not easy at all,” said Li Ruochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” Even Chu Feng felt surprised. After all, he was also able to tell that Li Taiyi was someone who cared about face a lot. Furthermore, he was rather stubborn too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really. I personally witnessed it. That said, the reason why he did that is all because of you. My little brother Chu Feng, you have truly frightened many people from our clan,” said Li Ruochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big sister Ruochu, do you know what Kong Tianhui’s little sister’s name is?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do. Kong Tianhui has a fully biological younger sister by the name of Kong Ci.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reportedly, that girl is very beautiful. However, that’s not the important aspect. What’s important is that she is exceptionally talented. Her talent seems to even surpass that of Kong Tianhui.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“By the way, why are you asking this?” Li Ruochu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kong Tianhui mentioned it to me just then. However, his explanation was completely unclear. That’s why I became curious,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s the case. It’s normal for you to be curious. After all, the Three Cities are no ordinary powers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reportedly, although they do not associate themselves with the matters of the world, they are filled with talents.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s talk about only the current younger generations. Divine Body Royal City has Kong Ci, the Monstrous Holy City has Xian Yun, and Ancestral Martial Dragon City has Long Ning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those three girls not only all possess exceptional talent, but their beauty is also said to be comparable to that of celestial fairies. Furthermore, as the Three Cities are withdrawn from worldly matters, the people of the world address the three of them as the Three Celestial Fairies, untainted by the mundane world,” said Li Ruochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of it, I’m also quite interested in seeing exactly how beautiful those three girls might be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Ruochu’s eyes were actually shining with golden light as she said those words, revealing a smitten look. It would appear that she was not joking around, and really did want to see what those three girls looked like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Feng had an ominous feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had truly witnessed too many beautiful women of the younger generation in his journey. Especially those with similar talents, although they would appear to be harmonious on the surface, they would actually secretly fight against one another, and not be harmonious at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, none of those women, were people that were easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was not only Chu Xuanyuan’s son. Now, he had also obtained the first ranked place. Should he meet the three girls after arriving at Divine Body Royal City, who knew what might end up happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short period of interaction, Chu Feng and Li Ruochu walked out. Kong Tianhui was waiting for them outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Kong Tianhui was very talkative to begin with, when the cheerful Li Ruochu was added to the group, the three of them began to chat merrily with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng discovered that Kong Tianhui was very fond of boasting. He was not boasting about his cultivation. Instead, he was boasting about his aesthetics and knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being truly unable to endure Kong Tianhui’s boasting anymore, Chu Feng suddenly looked to Li Ruochu and asked, “Big sister Ruochu, earlier, you said that Long Ning, Kong Ci and Xian Yun are deemed to be Three Celestial Faeries untainted by the mundane world, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. What about it?” Li Ruochu blinked her large eyes as she looked to Chu Feng. She was confused by why Chu Feng suddenly brought up this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s strange. How come I’ve heard of another name for them?” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? What is it?” Li Ruochu looked to Chu Feng with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Flowers of the Three Cities,” said Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pfff,” Li Ruochu laughed in the same manner Chu Feng had previously. Then, she looked to Chu Feng. “You’ve most likely been scammed by a fool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed out loud. Then, he looked to Kong Tianhui.</span></p>
