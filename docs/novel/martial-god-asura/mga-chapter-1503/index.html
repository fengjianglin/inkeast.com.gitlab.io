 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1503 - The Potential To Become An Overlord</strong></p>
 <p>“No, this is too dangerous!!!”</p>
 <p>“Since that Yan Clan’s Ancestor wants to nurture that member of the younger generation by the name of Yan Xie into an overlord, he will undoubtedly plan to sweep everything that might stand before that Yan Xie’s path away.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng possesses the potential to become an overlord. Thus, he is evidently an obstruction to that Yan Xie. If we were to bring Chu Feng there, wouldn’t this be equivalent to bringing a lamb into the tiger’s den?” Hong Qiang instantly refused. He did not think that this was a good idea.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. That village is their territory. Furthermore, that Yan Clan’s Ancestor is a Martial Emperor. If we were to go there, we will be at an absolute disadvantage. If they did not have any selfish motives, it would be fine. However, if they do, we will likely not be able to return after going there,” Miao Renlong also felt that this was not a good idea.</p>
 <p>“Going to the Yan Clan’s territory is simply even more dangerous than going to the Cursed Soil Sect. For the Cursed Soil Sect, we can move about in the dark and infiltrate it quietly. However, for the Yan Clan, we must go there openly. If they wish to harm us, we will not even have the opportunity to run away,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master said.</p>
 <p>“Actually, the Yan Clan’s Ancestor is our Cyanwood Sacred Assembly’s Assembly Master’s best friend. Furthermore, I’ve also met him before in my youth. Although he is a grand individual and remote from worldly matters, he is not a bad person. In fact, I felt from the bottom of my heart that he was a good man. That’s because, over all these many years, he has never once done any malicious deeds. All that he has ever done were good deeds.”</p>
 <p>“Although his desire is to nurture an overlord, his motive is not so that the Yan Clan can reach the apex. Instead, he purely wants to help the humans nurture another overlord.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because he does not possess any hatred for Emperor Qing. On the contrary, he feels a lot of adoration for Emperor Qing. He has personally said that if it wasn’t for Emperor Qing, the Holy Land of Martialism would likely have been completely destroyed.”</p>
 <p>“Emperor Qing was a hero. Not only was he a hero of his era, he was an eternal hero to the entire Holy Land of Martialism.”</p>
 <p>“He felt that the Holy Land of Martialism would never be at peace. It was very possible for a catastrophe like the one from ten thousand years ago to befall the Holy Land of Martialism again in the near future. If such a catastrophe were to befall the Holy Land of Martialism when there is no overlord like Emperor Qing protecting it, it is very possible that the Holy Land of Martialism would be truly destroyed.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, the reason the Yan Clan’s Ancestor wants to nurture an overlord is not for the sake of the Yan Clan. Instead, it is for the sake of the entire human race.”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps you all will think that my words are too unrealistic and irrelevant. After all, the people of this era are all blinded by greed. Thus, how could there be someone as grand as that?”</p>
 <p>“However, that is the truth. I might as well tell you all this secret. Yan Xie is not someone from the Yan Clan. Instead, he is someone that the Yan Clan had brought from elsewhere.”</p>
 <p>“Since the very beginning, the Yan Clan’s Ancestor did not have his gaze fixed on the Yan Clan. Instead, he has been looking at the entire Holy Land of Martialism, the entire human race.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, even if Chu Feng is to be defeated in this spar, it will do no harm. Yet, if Chu Feng were to be able to successfully obtain victory, the Yan Clan’s Ancestor might instead begin to think highly of Chu Feng. Chu Feng will then be able to obtain his good graces.”</p>
 <p>“With the Yan Clan’s Ancestor’s personality, he will definitely not watch as Chu Feng goes to the Cursed Soil Sect to throw his life away. Thus, he will definitely provide a helping hand.”</p>
 <p>“However, there is a prerequisite for this to happen. That is, Chu Feng must be able to obtain his good graces and make him realize that he is a rare talent, someone who possesses the potential to become an overlord.”</p>
 <p>“As for obtaining all of these, the most direct method would be for Chu Feng to defeat Yan Xie,” Dugu Xingfeng explained.</p>
 <p>“That still won’t do. Although you might have known him for a long time, that is no guarantee that you know his true nature. Even if that Yan Xie is not someone from the Yan Clan, he is still someone that the Yan Clan’s Ancestor has nurtured for many years. Thus, he is bound to have sentiments for Yan Xie.”</p>
 <p>“In any era, there can only be a single overlord. If he had to choose whether to nurture Yan Xie or Chu Feng, he will definitely choose to nurture Yan Xie.”</p>
 <p>“If Chu Feng were to defeat Yan Xie, he would definitely be angered. For Yan Xie, he would definitely root out Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“If Chu Feng is the one that has to take on this risk, I would rather that we not try to request the help of this Martial Emperor, and instead go to the Cursed Soil Sect ourselves.” Hong Qiang still refused. He did not trust this Yan Clan’s Ancestor.</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, “I am willing to give it a try.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this is no small matter. You must think over it carefully,” Hong Qiang urged.</p>
 <p>“Senior Hong Qiang, I know that you are thinking for my sake. I also know that seniors are very strong. With you all here, the probability of success in going to the Cursed Soil Sect to rescue my friend have increased greatly.”</p>
 <p>“However, if it is truly as Lord Headmaster says, and the Cursed Soil Sect is guarded by a Martial Emperor, the Cursed Soil Sect would be too dangerous, much more dangerous than what we had anticipated. I do not wish for you all to bear this sort of risk for me.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I wish to go and request the help of that Yan Clan’s Ancestor.”</p>
 <p>“I think that if what Lord Headmaster has said is the truth, and that senior did not even bother with the management of his own clan or try to increase their might using his strength because he wishes to help the human race nurture an overlord, and has been putting all of his attention on an outsider, then he is truly a very grand individual worthy of the greatest admiration.”</p>
 <p>“As such, even if he refuses to help us, I still wish to pay this senior a visit,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“This…” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Hong Qiang, Miao Renlong and the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master looked to one another. Then, they suddenly smiled.</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case, let’s go there then,” The three men said in unison. They had managed to come to an agreement.</p>
 <p>“Look, that is what is meant by having the potential to become an overlord. I spoke for so long, yet you all refused to trust me. However, Chu Feng merely said a couple sentences, yet you all agreed immediately.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, there are things that cannot be said or understood clearly. However, one has no choice but to accept them,” Dugu Xingfeng said while smiling.</p>
 <p>“Haha, that’s true,” Hong Qiang and the others also started to smile and laugh.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng appeared to be very embarrassed. However, he did not say anything and merely smiled.</p>
 <p>An era’s overlord? Chu Feng’s footsteps would definitely not only stop at that. That was because Chu Feng’s goal was not here. Chu Feng’s goal was the Outer World.</p>
 <p>That was a region that Dugu Xingfeng and the others did not know about, a region that they had never heard about. If Chu Feng wished to go there and challenge his own powerful clan, he had to become extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>The overlord of the Holy Land of Martialism, that would be a pretty decent springboard. If he could not even gain control over this region, how would he be able to contend against his clan in the Outer World?</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng possessed the confidence to become this era’s overlord. After all, the power of his bloodline was the Nine Divine Lightnings.</p>
 <p>After the decision was made, under Dugu Xingfeng’s guidance, Chu Feng and the others arrived at the place the Yan Clan was currently residing in.</p>
 <p>It was a relatively desolate and uninhabited place in the Cyanwood Domain. In other words, this place was a very good place to live in seclusion as there were no signs of human habitation here.</p>
 <p>The place where the Yan Clan was residing was known as the Cliff Village. Originally, it had been a very desolate village that originally only had several families who lived as hunters.</p>
 <p>After the Yan Clan had arrived in this place, this Cliff Village began to strengthen and expand day by day. From the original several families, it had now become several hundred families. Furthermore, while each and every family appeared to be ordinary common folk, they were actually all expert cultivators.</p>
 <p>There was a tavern in this village. The boss of that tavern was the strongest individual in this village. He was actually a Half Martial Emperor. Although he was only a rank one Half Martial Emperor, that cultivation was already pretty good.</p>
 <p>One must know, the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster was also only a rank one Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>As for this tavern, it was the one that Dugu Xingfeng had told Chu Feng to meet up with him at. However, now that Dugu Xingfeng had traveled here with them, there was no need for Chu Feng and the others to wait for him in this tavern. Instead, they directly crossed through the Cliff Village and arrived at the area behind it.</p>
