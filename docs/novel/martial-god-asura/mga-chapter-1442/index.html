 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1442 - Allow Junior A Try</strong></p>
 <p>“Have they gone to find Lil Mei?”</p>
 <p>“Something didn’t happen, right?” Chu Feng’s observation was very sharp, and he had discovered what had happened on the viewing platform.</p>
 <p>He had noticed that Su Mei had not been present from the beginning, therefore there could only be two possibilities as to why this was happening.</p>
 <p>The first possibility was that Su Mei was not in the World Spiritist Alliance at all. Therefore, she did not appear, or else, she would definitely stand forth to fight for the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>As for the other possibility, it would be that a special situation had happened to Su Mei that caused her to be unable to fight. If this was the case, then it would likely be her backlash acting up again.</p>
 <p>Thinking about this, Chu Feng secretly left the plaza and proceeded to fly toward Su Mei’s residence.</p>
 <p>After all, Su Mei was his beloved woman. Thus, Chu Feng was more worried about Su Mei’s safety than anyone else's.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated, Su Mei’s backlash had acted up again.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Su Mei was sitting cross-legged inside a palace hall. Standing not far away from her was the Left Reverend. Between Su Mei and the Left Reverend was a healing formation.</p>
 <p>This healing formation was being controlled by the Left Reverend, and he was steadily healing Su Mei.</p>
 <p>The Left Reverend was worried that Su Mei’s side effects might act up again. Thus, he had arrived at her place early in the morning to accompany her in case something were to happen so that he could quickly help Su Mei relieve the pain of her side effects and step forward to compete afterward.</p>
 <p>However, never would he have imagined that not only did Su Mei’s side effects act up, they were even more fierce than they had been previously. Even the Left Reverend was unable to quickly help Su Mei get rid of the pain of her side effects. The only thing he could do was slow them down.</p>
 <p>Right now, it had been some time since the match against the Dongfang Imperial Clan had started. Thus, the Left Reverend was also worried. After all, the outcome of this match had great significance for their World Spiritist Alliance’s prestige. As for Su Mei, she was the key to victory in this fierce competition.</p>
 <p>“You all cannot enter.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Miao Renlong had arrived at Su Mei’s residence with Sima Ying. However, they were surprised to find out that the Left Reverend had ordered people to guard this place who were preventing anyone from entering.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, these two people who were guarding this place were no ordinary people either. They were two powerful elders from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly. Even Miao Renlong did not possess any authority before the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Milords, is Miss Lil Mei in there?” Miao Renlong asked.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Could it be that the World Spiritist Alliance’s brats are unable to win against that boy from the Dongfang Imperial Clan?” Among the two elders, the black-faced elder asked coldly.</p>
 <p>[1. In chinese, black face is not racially motivated. Instead, it’s actually a term that came from the Beijing Opera. Alongside black face are red face and white face. In beijing opera, they literally paint the character’s face a different color to denote their character. A red-faced character is an upright person. Lord Guan, Guan Yu, is always portrayed with a red face. White-faced characters are usually cunning villains. For example, Cao Cao. As for black face, they are characters with a very stern disposition that are outspoken and straightforward. One such example would be Lord Bao, Judge Bao Zheng. Other examples include the Three Dynasties’ Zhang Fei and the Water Margin’s Li Kui.]</p>
 <p>“Mn, the situation right now is pretty bad. We need Miss Lil Mei to save the show,” Miao Renlong said.</p>
 <p>“A bunch of trash. Aren’t they competing in world spirit techniques? How could you all be unable to win against that boy from the Dongfang Imperial Clan? Truly, our World Spiritist Alliance’s dignity has all been lost by you bunch of trash,” After hearing what Miao Renlong said, that elder grew extremely angry.</p>
 <p>“This…” Miao Renlong was left in an awkward situation. He did not know how to respond. After all, this was indeed a very humiliating matter. However, he was powerless to change what had happened.</p>
 <p>“Forget about it, it’s the disciples who are disappointing. Why are you making things difficult for Renlong?” The other elder spoke. Compared to that black-faced elder, his attitude was much better.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he explained to Miao Renlong, “Lil Mei is feeling unwell right now. Lord Reverend is currently treating her. After her treatment is done, she will be going over right away.”</p>
 <p>“Exactly what has happened to Miss Lil Mei? Is there a need for my help?” Miao Renlong asked with goodwill.</p>
 <p>“When even Lord Reverend is unable to help, what makes you think that you can?” The black-faced elder spoke with contempt.</p>
 <p>“I…” Miao Renlong was left speechless. If even the Left Reverend was unable to accomplish something, it would naturally be impossible for him too. However, he had merely made his suggestion with good intentions. Yet, this elder actually berated him in such a manner. It truly left him in a very awkward situation.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Sima Ying who was standing behind Miao Renlong was gnashing her teeth in extreme anger. If it weren’t for the fact that that black-faced elder possessed a very exceptional status, she would have already cursed him out.</p>
 <p>After all, Miao Renlong was the person who she respected the most and was simply on par with her own grandfather. As for this black-faced elder, his words were truly too offensive, so offensive that Sima Ying was unable to continue listening.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps I might be able to help,” Right at this moment, a man’s voice suddenly sounded from the sky. Following that, a figure landed from the sky and appeared before all of them.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng?!” When they saw Chu Feng, Miao Renlong and Sima Ying were both startled and delighted. They were startled because Chu Feng had suddenly appeared. They were also delighted because it was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng? You are that Chu Feng?!” When they saw Chu Feng, those two elders began to carefully size him up. Their manner when dealing with Chu Feng was very different than when they were dealing with other people from the younger generation.</p>
 <p>Especially that good-natured elder. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng was filled with appreciation and admiration. Evidently, he had heard about Chu Feng’s accomplishments and knew that he was a rare genius, an Asura World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>“I am indeed Chu Feng,” Chu Feng had heard how the black-faced elder had made things difficult for Miao Renlong earlier. Thus, he automatically had a bad impression of that elder.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng disliked him, he would naturally not treat him with respect. Thus, regardless of how much authority the two of them possessed, Chu Feng did not try to flatter or fawn at them. In fact, he did not even exhibit the simplest etiquette toward them.</p>
 <p>“Quite a tone you have there. Were you implying earlier that you are more powerful than Lord Reverend and are capable of doing something that even Lord Reverend cannot?” The black-faced elder started to mock and ridicule Chu Feng. His gaze was filled with ill intent.</p>
 <p>“I merely said that I might be able to help, I never said that I was certain that I would be able to help,” Chu Feng replied.</p>
 <p>“What a good ‘might’. To say ‘might’ means that it’s possible. Boy, you are truly arrogant and conceited,” The black-faced elder coldly berated Chu Feng. It seemed that he was already unable to bear Chu Feng’s attitude of acting so disrespectfully toward his seniors.</p>
 <p>“Allow them to come in,” However, right at this moment, Left Reverend’s voice sounded from the palace hall.</p>
 <p>“You all, go in.” Hearing that voice, the other elder did not hesitate, and immediately opened the door to the palace hall so that Chu Feng and the others could enter.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng who was anxious to see Su Mei immediately rushed forward to enter. As for Miao Renlong and Sima Ying, they both followed behind Chu Feng and entered too.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the good-natured elder turned to the black faced elder and asked, “Why are you entering too?” At this time, that black-faced elder was actually following Chu Feng and the others.</p>
 <p>“I shall see exactly what sorts of methods that boy might have,” After the black-faced elder left those words, he followed Chu Feng and the others inside.</p>
 <p>“You’ve lived for thousands of years already. Yet, you’re actually still competing against a child?” The good-natured elder sighed helplessly. After that, he closed the door and continued to stand guard outside.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng and the others continued forward. Soon, they arrived at the palace hall where Su Mei and the Left Reverend were.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng entered the palace hall and saw Su Mei, he instantly started to frown and felt a deep sense of heartache.</p>
 <p>Even though Su Mei was still wearing that black cloak that covered her facial appearance, covering her expression of pain, Chu Feng was able to imagine Su Mei’s deathly pale complexion and her expression of enduring great pain.</p>
 <p>“This… exactly what’s happening with Miss Lil Mei?” Although Miao Renlong didn’t know what was happening to Su Mei, he was able to tell that her situation was very bad from the Left Reverend’s strenuous appearance.</p>
 <p>“Lil Mei is feeling unwell. You also saw this now. However, do not worry. I can settle this.”</p>
 <p>“Renlong, return first. If the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan are to become anxious, find an excuse to delay them. If that doesn’t work, then allow them to do whatever they want,” The Left Reverend said.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Milord,” Miao Renlong did not dare to disobey the Left Reverend’s orders. He turned around and prepared to leave.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, Chu Feng eye’s were fixed on Su Mei as he stood there motionlessly with an unnatural expression.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. What are you still looking at? Did you truly think that you can help?” The black-faced elder said to Chu Feng. His tone was one of mockery.</p>
 <p>“Lord Reverend, can you allow junior a try?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“What? You really want to try?” Hearing Chu Feng’s words, the black-faced elder’s mouth was wide open with shock.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only him. Even Miao Renlong and Sima Ying, who had been planning to leave stopped their footsteps and looked to Chu Feng with gazes of shock.</p>
