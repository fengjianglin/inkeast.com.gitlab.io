 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 798 - Suffering Double Losses</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“What… What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention Murong Xun, even Xuan Xiaochao and the others were stupefied. Putting aside how Chu Feng stopped the horrifying Royal Armament attack from before, how did this Mastered armament come into Chu Feng’s hands?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Return!” Murong Xun suddenly extended his hand and grabbed at the Royal Armament, seeming to want to recall it into his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Royal Armament also started to lightly quiver in Chu Feng’s hand, as if it wanted to escape his control, but when Chu Feng held it like that, it simply could not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm* Just at that moment, a black-coloured ray of light suddenly shot out of the Demon Sealing Sword. In the instant it entered the silver-coloured spear, it immediately stopped quivering and calmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Murong Xun’s expression distorted greatly. He discovered with astonishment that his connection with the Royal Armament was cut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!” Murong Xun was outraged. Without saying anything, he rushed straight towards Chu Feng. When he was near, he leapt into the air and struck down with a punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*bam*</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh—” But, who would have thought, when he was three meters away from Chu Feng, his punch was not only stop, he was even thrown out by a powerful wave of force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*puchi* When he crashed onto the ground, a mouthful of blood sprayed out. The wave was so strong it injured his internal organs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Eighth Immortal, the connection between me and the Royal Armament has been severed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he could do nothing about it, Murong Xun could only ask the Eighth Immortal for help. In the instant he struck, he learnt that there was an invisible power protecting Chu Feng. Murong Xun could no longer take back his Royal Armament with his own abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh!” Hearing those words, the Eighth Immortal roared, then he moved and rushed straight for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth King, who was initially fighting the Eighth Immortal, did not stop him. He stood on the spot, his eyes akin to flames. He silently observed, lacking any sign of worry on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Eighth Immortal, with the might of a Martial King, made an attack at Chu Feng, the same outcome actually occurred. Not only was he unable to harm Chu Feng, he too was thrown back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*puu—* After crashing onto the ground as well, the Eighth Immortal also spat out blood. But, blood didn’t just come out of his mouth. At that moment, all seven of his facial orifices had blood flowing out. Even his skin started to crack. Even his body starting to turn black from purple, almost as if he would explode soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit. Young master, we must leave right now, or else we won’t make it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such a situation, the Eighth Immortal no longer cared about the Royal Armament in Chu Feng’s hand, nor did he care whether Murong Wan was willing or not. With the wave of his big sleeve, he took the siblings Murong Xun and Murong Wan, put them behind him, and sealed the two with a mighty Spirit Formation power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huu—”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sealing them in the Spirit Formation, the Eighth Immortal’s eyes suddenly turned blood-red. Soon after, his body was once again ignited by the purple-coloured flames. Moreover, this time, they were even fiercer than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With overwhelming killing intent, he shouted, “Everyone, get the hell out of my way! Or else, you will all die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, don’t even think about it!” Xuan Xiaochao and the others all coldly snorted. They were very resolute—they would absolutely not let them go so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let him leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just at that moment, the Earth King pushed Xuan Xiaochao and the others to the side. After casting an expression at them via his eyes, he smiled and said to the Eighth Immortal, “No matter what sort of character you have, at least you are loyal to the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Because of that, I’ll let you go today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Eighth Immortal was taken aback by the Earth King’s words, he didn’t waste any of his own breath. Biting down on his teeth, he moved and with the blazing body of his, he brought Murong Xun and Murong Wan away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Earth King, he’s let go just like that?” After the Eighth Immortal left, Xuan Xiaochao and the others walked up, extremely confused why he chose to do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Eighth Immortal used his own life for fighting power. He will not live on for too much longer. Even if he is let go, he will certainly die today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let alone the Eighth Immortal, a loyal person who protects his master even though death is the price, ‘If a rabbit is forced into a corner, it will still bite’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rather than a fight to the death against him, causing injuries on both sides, why not just let him go? I’ve already taken care of the Ninth Immortal when I entered, so even if he leaves, he can only save Murong Xun and Murong Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for Murong Xun, although he has a bit of talent, he will not be able to achieve anything great. There has never been a need to fear him, let alone now, when he’s lost such a precious Royal Armament.” After speaking, the Earth King cast his slightly squinted gaze at Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! This Murong Xun originally came here for the Royal Armament, but quite unexpectedly, not only has his entire army of experts been defeated, he even lost his own Royal Armament! They’ve truly suffered enormous losses this time,” Xuan Xiaochao said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Brother Wuqing, you are truly impressive. Not only did you toy with Murong Xun’s fiancée and sister, you even stole his Royal Armament! I, You Tonghan, truly kowtow to your actions and sigh at my inferiority!” You Tonghan clasped his hands at Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Wuqing, I’ve already heard of your grand name before, and you are indeed as the rumours say you are. I, Fu Fengming, feel great admiration.” Fu Fengming also greeted Chu Feng politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, I heard Old Liu say it’s because of you that the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation was activated successfully. Saving you back then was truly worthwhile. Right now, I don’t need any thanks for that. Rather, I should be thanking you,” said Xuan Xiaochao with a face of admiration. When he entered, Old Liu had told him that he must protect Chu Feng, because without Chu Feng, they would not have the power they currently had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng only smiled calmly at their praises, not too certain how to reply. The matter You Tonghan mentioned especially made him feel a bit embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his goal in doing all this was to make Murong Xun lose face—though it was initiated by venting the anger in his heart—when You Tonghan looked up to him like an idol, he felt a bit embarrassed. In the end, it was still nothing glorious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh…* Just at that moment, nine people rushed in from the tunnel one after the other, and landed inside the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers. However, the seventh brother did not follow them in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, although their auras were still very weak, they had recovered quite a bit. At least, they had the strength to move. Evidently, they had received treatment and healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they entered and saw that Chu Feng actually held Murong Xun’s Royal Armament in his hand, all of their expressions changed. They felt great shock, and asked nearly simultaneously, “Wuqing, th-th-th-the thing in your hand, isn’t that Murong Xun’s Royal Armament? Wh-wh-why do you have it?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Seniors, you’ve come late. There was an even more wondrous spectacle before that you haven’t seen,” said Xuan Xiaochao happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Earth King, what is going on? What happened?” The Nine Gold-cloak Brothers were quite confused when they heard those words. So, they all cast their gazes at the respected Earth King, trying to get to the end of this matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Little Liu, you won’t understand just by a short explanation. All in all, this time, the young master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Murong Xun, has truly suffered double losses!” The Earth King also laughed, joy similarly filling his aged face.</span></p>
