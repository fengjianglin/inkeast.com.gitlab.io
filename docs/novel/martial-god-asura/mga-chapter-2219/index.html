 <p><strong> Chapter 2219 - Tier One Powers</strong></p>
 <p>“I have heard from her that her master’s name is Su Jingrui,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually Su Jingrui?” Hearing that name, Liu Xiaoli, Liu Chengkun and the others all revealed astonished expressions.</p>
 <p>“No wonder, no wonder they addressed him as ‘elder’ and not ‘Valley Master’,” Liu Xiaoli said with a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Exactly who is that Su Jingrui?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“You don’t know?” Liu Xiaoli and the others were even more shocked.</p>
 <p>“I don’t,” Chu Feng shook his head with a smile.</p>
 <p>“That Su Jingrui is the strongest person in the Sunset Cloud Valley apart from the Valley Master,” A management elder said.</p>
 <p>“No, I’ve heard that Su Jingrui’s strength is not weaker than the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master,” Liu Chengkun said.</p>
 <p>“In short, that Su Jingrui is extremely powerful. Regardless of whether it is his status or his strength, they are both extremely high in the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p>
 <p>“With him supporting the Red Butterfly Society, Luyang’s Pavilion will likely not dare to do anything to us either.”</p>
 <p>“As for all this, it’s all thanks to you, Chu Feng. I don’t know how I should thank you,” Liu Xiaoli looked to Chu Feng gratefully.</p>
 <p>Although their Red Butterfly Society could not attack Luyang’s Pavilion either from today on, it remained that their Red Butterfly Society was the one that had benefitted from this. After all, this was equivalent to them having escaped from the tiger’s den, having escaped from certain death. As for all of this, it was thanks to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng was merely an honored guest that she had wanted to rope into the Red Butterfly Society before, he had turned into a great benefactor to her now.</p>
 <p>“If you truly want to thank me, just invite me to another feast,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“That’s no problem. Men! Prepare a feast! Bring out all of our Red Butterfly Society’s delicacies.”</p>
 <p>“I will prepare a feast today. All of the Red Butterfly Society’s members must participate in this feast so as to express our thanks to Chu Feng,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“Lady Society President, please allow this subordinate to handle it,” A management elder asked for permission.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead. Make sure to prepare it properly,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“As per your order,” That elder did not dare to be neglectful. He turned around and entered the Red Butterfly Society.</p>
 <p>“Lady Society President, then what about that Zhao Xuan and Zhao Xiao?” Another management elder asked.</p>
 <p>“Zhao Xuan dared to poison Chu Feng together with Zhao Ruofan. His crimes cannot be forgiven. Kill him.”</p>
 <p>“As for Zhao Xiao, even though he should also be killed, it remains that he did not directly participate in it. As such, it would suffice to expel him from our Red Butterfly Society,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“For real? Release him? This Red Butterfly Society’s President is too irresolute, no?” After hearing Liu Xiaoli’s decision, Eggy’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears.</p>
 <p>“Milady Queen, if it was you, what would you do?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“If it was me, I would definitely kill without exception. I would not leave a single person from the Zhao Family alive,” Eggy said with firm resolution.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he asked no more. Each person possessed their own way of handling things.</p>
 <p>Liu Xiaoli was indeed a bit too benevolent. As for Eggy, she was a bit too ruthless.</p>
 <p>If it was Chu Feng making the decision, he would definitely investigate this matter first. If Zhao Xiao was truly innocent, he would definitely release him. However, if he did any misdeeds, he would definitely not spare him.</p>
 <p>However, Liu Xiaoli decided to spare him without even investigating. Her actions were truly a bit too forgiving.</p>
 <p>However, it remained that this was the Red Butterfly Society’s domestic affair. Thus, Chu Feng did not try to involve himself in it too much.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The feast that followed was very grand. As for Liu Xiaoli, she even publicly announced the matters of what happened today.</p>
 <p>She informed all of the people from their Red Butterfly Society that they should have been eliminated today, but were saved by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Gratefulness. After finding out about this matter, everyone felt extremely grateful toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Admiration; After finding out that Chu Feng was actually friends with Su Jingrui’s personal disciple, both men and women felt great admiration for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, only Chu Feng knew that he had only met Xu Yiyi once. Thus, this time around, he truly owed her a favor.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The feast continued for three nights and three days. After the feast, Liu Xiaoli ordered her people to search for the next location to move their headquarters to.</p>
 <p>Even though Luyang’s Pavilion did not dare to come to disturb the Red Butterfly Society after being threatened by the Sunset Cloud Pavilion, for the sake of guarding against the unexpected, Liu Xiaoli still wanted to move the headquarters quickly.</p>
 <p>Merely, due to the fact that the time for Mount Cloud Crane’s assembly was about to arrive, Liu Xiaoli was unable to personally search for a new location or construct the new Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters. The reason for that was because she had to proceed for Mount Cloud Crane with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Only Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli were on the journey to Mount Cloud Crane. After all, the Red Butterfly Society could only be considered to be a third tier power in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and not a major power. Thus, if they were to bring forth too extravagant of a display, they would only be mocked by others, or even provoke others. Thus, it was better for them to be low-profile.</p>
 <p>Before Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli even arrived at Mount Cloud Crane, their pupils shrank back and their eyes revealed astonished expressions when they’d just seen the appearance of that Mount Cloud Crane from afar.</p>
 <p>As its name implied, Mount Cloud Crane was a mountain.</p>
 <p>Merely, this mountain was not a mountain on the surface of the earth. Rather, it was a mountain floating above the clouds.</p>
 <p>Looking from afar, Mount Cloud Crane had the appearance of a red-crowned crane. However, for some reason, whether it was an illusion or not, that crane’s two enormous wings were actually moving. It was as if the enormous crane was alive, and not a mountain.</p>
 <p>It was a magnificent sight. Even though Chu Feng had seen many magnificent sights, Chu Feng was still astonished by the spectacular sight of that crane.</p>
 <p>Unable to contain herself, Liu Xiaoli praised, “Is this the ability of an Exalted? It is truly something that causes one to broaden their horizons. It is truly worthy of being a spectacle of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.” Likely, it was also her first time coming to Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>“Move aside, move aside,” Suddenly, a group of people flew by, Aggressively, flying toward Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>The closer Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli got to Mount Cloud Crane, the more they encountered such powers flying by from all directions. Furthermore, they were increasingly more aggressive.</p>
 <p>This was especially true when they saw people like Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli, who had arrived by themselves. Toward those people, they were even more aggressive.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that there will be people like them regardless of what sort of place we might be at,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“People like them?” Liu Xiaoli asked.</p>
 <p>“People that bully the weak and fear the strong,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Liu Xiaoli’s expression changed slightly. She revealed a worried expression.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, Golden Crane True Immortal is extremely famous in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. His influence is enormous.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, even though he is only holding an assembly to assist world spiritists, practically all of the powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm have dispatched people to participate in this assembly.”</p>
 <p>“Earlier, the group of people that passed by us were from a tier two power. As for those tier two powers, they are all existences that we cannot afford to offend,” Liu Xiaoli said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“There seems to be quite a lot of tier two powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. How are they distinguished?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“There is also a difference in strength between the tier two powers. If a power’s leader possesses strength reaching that of a rank six Martial Ancestor, they would be able to declare themselves a tier two power,” Liu Xiaoli explained.</p>
 <p>“Then what about tier one powers?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Tier one powers are generally overseen by True Immortal-level experts,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“Wasn’t it said that very few people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm are capable of becoming True Immortals?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. That’s why there are only four tier one powers right now,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“Which four?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Buddha’s Heavenly Temple.”</p>
 <p>“The Immortal Sword School.”</p>
 <p>“The Zhou Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“And the Kong Heavenly Clan,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
