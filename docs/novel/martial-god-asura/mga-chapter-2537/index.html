 <p><strong>Chapter 2537 - Stolen Treasure</strong></p>
 <p>This time around, Chu Feng did not choose to follow the safe path. Instead, he began to walk amongst the dangerous slaughtering formations.</p>
 <p>Actually, Ying Mingchao had not only mentioned the route directly to the depths of the Demon Elimination Cave, but he had also told Chu Feng the locations of some rich powerful slaughtering formations.</p>
 <p>Thus, even if Chu Feng did not follow the direct and safe route, as long as he was on guard, he would be able to avoid many slaughtering formations, and travel amongst the dangers of the Demon Elimination Cave.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Chu Feng was planning to proceed for one of the most dangerous regions in the Demon Elimination Cave. It was a place with a lot of slaughtering formations aggregate together.</p>
 <p>That region of slaughtering formations was composed of the most frightening slaughtering formations in the Demon Elimination Cave.</p>
 <p>As Young Master Li Ming said, the more dangerous a place was, the safer it’d be.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Chu Feng felt that the people from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan would definitely not to dare to approach that group of slaughtering formations.</p>
 <p>Also, as they knew very well how powerful the group of slaughtering formations were, they would definitely not expect Chu Feng and Li Ming to proceed for that region.</p>
 <p>After all, they most definitely felt that if Chu Feng and Young Master Li Ming, with the strength they possessed, were to encounter any of the slaughtering formations inside by accident, they would undoubtedly be killed.</p>
 <p>That, this group of slaughtering formations would be the safest place in the Demon Elimination Cave right now. Of course... it would also be a very dangerous location.</p>
 <p>If they were to be careless, Chu Feng and Young Master Li Ming might very well die amongst the group of slaughtering formations.</p>
 <p>“We must stop here. The slaughtering formations here are too powerful. If we are to enter deeper, we will likely not be able to escape even if we want to,” Chu Feng stopped at a hidden location.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was not lying. Although there appeared to be nothing before them, according to the information Ying Mingchao had given him, before them was the most concentrated location of slaughtering formations in the entire Demon Elimination Cave.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was unable to even advertise those slaughtering formations. From this, it could be determined how important those slaughtering formations were.</p>
 <p>Thus, if they were to enter it, they would definitely be undoubtedly killed.</p>
 <p>"How do you know this place so well?" Young Master Li Ming asked curiously.</p>
 <p>"Can you tell me how you offended the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan?" Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>Then, Spirit Master began to flow out of her body. Spirit power began to gallop around her, sealing her off.</p>
 <p>Young Master Li Ming was healing her injuries.</p>
 <p>“Even though you’re helping her this much, it seems like this girl is not appreciative of your kindness.”</p>
 <p>"She has quite a personality," Her Lady Queen said with a mischievous laugh.</p>
 <p>Even though Young Master Li Ming was proud and arrogant, Her Lady Queen did not dislike her either.</p>
 <p>“Let her do as she wishes. After all, I am not helping her because I wanted it to be reciprocated.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng revealed an indifferent expression. Then, he sat down cross-legged and continued to heal his injuries as well.</p>
 <p>The backlash from the Ancient Era’s War Sword was no small matter. Although the backlash had not affected Chu Feng’s battle power, it still took him half a day to suppress the backlash.At the moment when Chu Feng opened his eyes and looked to Young Master Li Ming, he just so happened to catch the sight of the spirit power surrounding her dispersing. Young Master Li Ming also slowly opened her tightly closed eyes.</p>
 <p>Even in the moment, Young Master Li Ming had a rosy complexion. Even her skin had become plump and full of luster again. Her aura had also returned to being robust and vigorous.</p>
 <p>It seemed like that girl had also managed to suppress the backlash she already received using her Immortal Armament.</p>
 <p>"This girl is quite amazing," Seeing that Young Master Li Ming appeared still be completely fine now, even Her Lady Queen was unable to keep herself from praising her.</p>
 <p>One should know that the backlash Young Master Li Ming was earlier was much more serious than Chu Feng’s backlash.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng’s aura was affected, his battle power was still present. As such, he would, at the very least, be able to take care of anyone below the True Immortal level of cultivation.</p>
 <p>As for Young Master Li Ming, she had not even had the strength to fly. The intensity of the backlashes that they suffered was simply a heaven and earth difference.</p>
 <p>Yet, faced with such an enormous backlash, Young Master Li Ming actually managed to contain it using the same amount of time Chu feng did. This was naturally extremely astonishing.</p>
 <p>“She must have taken some sort of special medicinal pellet. This girl is truly of extraordinary origin,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>In terms of world spirit techniques, even if Chu Feng was not superior to Young Master Li Ming, his world spirit techniques would definitely not be inferior to hers.</p>
 <p>Thus, the speed at which they healed their injuries was most definitely unrelated to their world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>If there was no difference in terms of world spirit techniques, then it would most definitely be the medicinal pellet that Young Master Li Ming took.</p>
 <p>That single medicinal pellet was able to decrease the time she needed to heal her injuries to such a short amount. Merely with that, one could very well imagine how powerful that medicinal pellet was.</p>
 <p>At the very least, Chu Feng did not possess such a powerful medicinal pellet. In fact, not a single person in the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm possessed such a medicinal pellet.</p>
 <p>“You’ve saved me once. I do not wish to owe you a favor,” Young Master Li Ming said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“How do you wish to repay me then? Could you be planning to devote your life to me?” Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Young Master Li Ming’s expression immediately sunk. Coldly, she said, “Don’t you think that I will not kill you just because we’ve settled what happened on Mount Cloud Crane. If you make this kind of joke again, I will attack you again.”</p>
 <p>“Since you knew it was a joke, why take it so seriously?” Chu Feng said with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“You can joke with others. However, I am someone who is not fond of jokes,” Young Master Li Ming spoke very earnestly.</p>
 <p>“Actually, I am not fond of jokes either. However, I just so happen to be fond of joking with someone like you.”</p>
 <p>“I also do not know why that’s the case. However, I’m unable to control myself. I guess this might be natural instinct.”</p>
 <p>“However, I will try my best to restrain myself. If I happen to be unable to restrain myself, I hope that you will forgive me,” Chu Feng said with an innocent expression on his face. It was as if he was not voluntarily joking.</p>
 <p>“I do not wish to waste time arguing with you,” Young Master Li Ming cast a side eye at Chu Feng. Then, she said, “Didn’t you wish to know exactly what I’ve stolen from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan?”</p>
 <p>“It’s these.”</p>
 <p>As Young Master Li Ming spoke, she opened her palm. Two pearl-sized beads were present on her palm.</p>
 <p>“Those are?”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the two beads, Chu Feng’s gaze immediately changed. He who was laughing and smiling instantly turned extremely serious.</p>
 <p>Those two beads were only the size of ordinary pearls. They were very smooth and round.</p>
 <p>The two beads seemed to be made of glass. The insides of the beads were pitch-black.</p>
 <p>However, should one pay close attention to them, one would discover that the pitch-black color was not the original color of the beads.</p>
 <p>The pitch-black substance contained inside the beads were like black clouds that surged about like a gathering storm within them.</p>
 <p>In fact, if one were to pay close attention, one would even feel fear. The reason for that was because the pitch-black clouds were extremely gloomy in nature. It was as if the black clouds contained boundless killing intent.</p>
 <p>Upon noticing the unusual properties of the beads, Chu Feng immediately activated his Heaven’s Eyes. Upon the activation of his Heaven’s Eyes, the beads grew much clearer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to see that the two beads were like two worlds. The worlds were covered by black clouds. However, in the center of each of the worlds was an enormous gate, a very imposing gate that emitted a sort of sacredness.</p>
 <p>The gates were tightly closed. It was as if, unless the gates were to open by themselves, or if one possessed the key to open them, one would not be able to open them even if one possessed heaven-defying capabilities.</p>
