 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly what is going on? Can you explain things more clearly?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu Feng, this matter is a little complicated. Hear me out, I’ll slowly explain things to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Tianhui began to inform Chu Feng about everything that happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, it was actually not as complicated as Kong Tianhui said it to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Divine Body Royal City, due to the fact that Kong Tianhui’s father was simply too licentious, Kong Tianhui ended up having a lot of siblings, mostly older siblings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, amongst his siblings, many of them were known to be geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among them was a man who was Kong Tianhui’s half older brother by the same father. This man was named Kong Feiyang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Kong Feiyang was no longer a person of the younger generation, he was only fifty years older than Kong Tianhui, and not even two hundred years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had the same cultivation as Kong Tianhui. He too was a rank one Exalted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Kong Feiyang and Kong Tianhui had never gotten along with one another since their childhood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the two of them were brothers, they could be said to be old enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By pure coincidence, when Chu Feng was fighting Linghu Hongfei in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, both Kong TIanhui and Kong Feiyang were present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, there were actually many elders from Divine Body Royal City present. Furthermore, those elders were all praising Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Tianhui wanted to show off. Since he had that compass that was capable of suppressing spirit power, he declared on the spot that he would definitely be able to defeat Chu Feng should he and Chu Feng fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Kong Tianhui was merely speaking without thinking, merely trying to show off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, to his surprise, that Kong Feiyang actually stood forward and began to insult Kong Tianhui, saying that he was overestimating his capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them started quarreling on the spot. As they continued to quarrel, Kong Tianhui, under enormous rage, decided to declare that he would challenge Chu Feng, and even bet his life that he would defeat him. That… was the reason why he traveled to the Chu Heavenly Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Kong Tianhui was confident that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely, he never expected Chu Feng’s cultivation to have increased to rank one Exalted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that it would be very difficult for him to defeat Chu Feng now. Thus, with no alternative, he decided to reveal the truth to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And here I was thinking that you were truly in some sort of crisis. Turns out, you merely decided to make a gamble with someone,” Chu Feng took a glance of contempt at Kong Tianhui. He felt that Kong Tianhui was making an enormous fuss over an extremely minor issue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, Chu Feng was even wondering what it was that could threaten Kong Tianhui’s life. However upon learning the truth, he felt extremely helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu Feng, this is not a simple gamble,” Kong Tianhui explained with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, if you are to win, would that Kong Feiyang kill himself?” asked Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With how shameless he is, he would definitely not kill himself,” said Kong Tianhui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There you go,” said Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not the same. If I am to defeat you, Kong Tianhui will lose all his face and be completely humiliated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu Feng, as far as I’m concerned, this is extremely important. There’s a fifty year age difference between him and I. Logically, I am more talented than him. Yet, he has been unwilling to accept that the entire time, and continued to go against me in everything. I have truly been oppressed by him for too long,” said Kong Tianhui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, why don’t you fight him directly and defeat him? Wouldn’t you be able to prove yourself even better that way?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I were able to defeat him, I wouldn’t have bothered with all this. The crucial aspect is that I was unable to defeat him when I was younger, and ended up being defeated by him every time. In recent years, although my cultivation has caught up to his, I'm still unable to defeat him. At the very most, we would only tie.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The current situation is that he has defeated me before, whereas I have never managed to defeat him,” said Kong Tianhui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your talent surpasses his. As time passes, you will sooner or later be able to defeat him. Why bother seeking victory right now?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“While that makes sense and I was indeed acting too impatient, the issue is that we already decided to make a bet with one another. Furthermore, many of my fellow clansmen and elders were present. If I cannot defeat you, I will be the one that’ll be completely humiliated,” Kong Tianhui’s eyes were flickering nonstop. His eyes resembled the eyes of a little girl; they were filled with grievance and very pitiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no matter how Chu Feng looked at those eyes, he felt them to be disgusting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nevertheless, Chu Feng still agreed to help him. “Fine, I’ll help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu Feng, are you serious?” Kong Tianhui simply did not dare to believe his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Tianhui knew very well that requesting a top genius to lose publicly lose to him was something very few people were willing to do. After all, that was something that would ruin one’s reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the reason why he decided to coax and pester Chu Feng, why he would get off his high horse to worm his way into being friends with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course,” said Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But, you’ll have to return to Divine Body Royal City with me,” said Kong Tianhui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not an issue,” Chu Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha. Brother Chu Feng, you are truly good to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That said, you can rest assured too. I will not have you journey with me in vain. Once we’re there, I will introduce two great beauties to you,” said Kong Tianhui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for that. You also do not have to prepare any gifts either. Also, don’t bother trying some honey trap. I'm merely helping you because I want to help,” said Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No no, that’s not it at all. Those two beauties that I mentioned are no ordinary beauties,” as he said those words, a very proud expression appeared on Kong Tianhui’s face. Not only that, but he even raised his brows twice at Chu Feng. “Those two beauties I mentioned are little sister Xian Yun and little sister Long Ning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? Who are they?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wha?” Kong Tianhui was stupefied. His mouth hung wide open. “You’d better not tell me that you don’t know Xian Yun and Long Ning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t. Who are they?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I give up. Brother Chu Feng, you must’ve been infatuated with cultivating and turned yourself into a fool, right?” Kong Tianhui looked at Chu Feng with concern. However, he then began to explain who Xian Yun and Long Ning were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that Xian Yun was the strongest person of the younger generation from Monstrous Holy City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for that Long Ning, she was the strongest person of the younger generation from Ancestral Martial Dragon City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them not only possessed exceptional talent that Kong Tianhui described to be existences comparable to Linghu Hongfei and Chu Feng, but they were also rare beauties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu Feng, let me tell you, it’s not that easy to meet the two of them.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That said, in the upcoming days, it just so happens to be the time for the gathering of the Three Cities’ younger generations. Thus… you will be able to enjoy a treat for the eyes. At that time… I will also introduce that disappointing little sister of mine. Although I do not think my little sister is good looking at all, that girl is slightly pretty. An innumerable amount of men have also fallen for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because of that, I even gave them a title. It’s a very graceful title - Flowers of the Three Cities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Puu~~~” Chu Feng was originally quite interested as he continued to listen. However, all of a sudden, he burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Flowers of the Three Cities? Are you serious with that?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong? Was that title so graceful that it shocked you?” Kong Tianhui had a proud look on his face. He seemed to not have realized that Chu Feng was ridiculing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Graceful, graceful,” Chu Feng nodded repeatedly. However, he was unable to conceal his smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to admit that that fellow Kong Tianhui, after discarding his rude and unreasonable outward appearance to reveal his true character, was quite interesting to be around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he even gave Chu Feng a feeling of familiarity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chu Feng had to describe it, then he could only say that Kong Tianhui resembled Wang Qiang.</span></p>
