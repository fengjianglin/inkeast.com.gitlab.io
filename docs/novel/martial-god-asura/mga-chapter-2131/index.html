 <p><strong> Chapter 2131 - Finally Meeting Father</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was extremely excited to see the Old Ape. This was especially true when he discovered that the Old Ape still possessed an unfathomable depth that he couldn’t see through even now.</p>
 <p>“So you’ve come, Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>After the Old Ape saw Chu Feng, he stood up. His mouth lifted into a light smile.</p>
 <p>Compared to back then, his reaction was completely different. Back then, the Old Ape had had an extremely cold and ferocious attitude when he looked at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, his attitude was now filled with amiability. It was as if… he had been awaiting Chu Feng’s arrival the entire time.</p>
 <p>“This old servant pays his respect to Milord,” Seeing the old ape, the blind old man hurriedly kneeled to greet him.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, before the blind old man could actually kneel, the Old Ape waved his sleeve and lifted the blind old man back onto his feet.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to be overly courteous. Quickly, go in with Chu Feng,” The Old Ape said. As he said those words, his glanced at the Four Great Divine Beasts. He said, “However, as for the four of them, their statuses are too low. As such, they are not allowed to enter the Chu Clan’s Forbidden Area.”</p>
 <p>After he finished saying those words, the Old Ape sat back down in a cross-legged position beside the special bonfire.</p>
 <p>Normally, the Four Great Divine Beasts would definitely be enraged if someone would dare to speak to them in such a manner. However, when those words were spoken by the Old Ape, the four of them did not dare to reveal any trace of anger. Instead… they obediently sat down by the bonfire.</p>
 <p>After all, the Old Ape was an existence that even the blind old man could not compare to. Likely, no one other than the Old Ape himself knew how powerful he really was.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how powerful the Old Ape might be, it was certain that he would be able to kill them with merely a spit if he wished to.</p>
 <p>The Four Great Divine Beasts were not foolish. Thus, how could they possibly dare to act imprudently before such a powerful existence?</p>
 <p>At that moment, they became even more convinced of Chu Feng’s noble status. At the same time, they began to look forward to their journey to the Outer World even more.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng and the blind old man continued onward. Merely, as the two of them continued onward, they soon arrived before Chu Feng’s tombstone.</p>
 <p>That tomb had been set up for Chu Feng, and had been used to deceive the people of the Chu Clan.</p>
 <p>Back then, it had been destroyed by that fellow by the name of Chu Kongtong. However, it would appear that the tomb had since been restored.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng looked at the tombstone again, he was filled with joy.</p>
 <p>It was not because of the tombstone. Rather, it was because of the person standing beside the tombstone. Beside the tombstone was a beautiful woman.</p>
 <p>Her beauty and air of elegance was like that of a celestial fairy. She was none other than Zi Ling.</p>
 <p>Not only was the current Zi Ling completely unharmed, her aura was much more powerful than before. She had become a rank one Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Although that level of cultivation was greatly inferior to Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, it was already enormous progress when compared to the Zi Ling from back then.</p>
 <p>“Zi Ling,” Upon seeing Zi Ling, Chu Feng hurriedly rush to her and placed his hands onto her shoulders. Then, he surveyed her from head to toe, “Let me see if my foolish little girl is fine.”</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I’m fine,” Zi Ling smiled sweetly. Then, she looked to the blind old man and said, “Master, please rest assured too. I am completely healed.”</p>
 <p>“That’s great, that’s great,” The blind old man nodded repeatedly. A smile covering his face.</p>
 <p>The blind old man was not a heartless person. No matter what, he had instructed Zi Ling and the others before. Thus, he possessed a considerable amount of affection for Zi Ling and the others.</p>
 <p>“However, Miss Zi Ling, this old servant has now identified myself to Master. As such, you no longer need to address this old servant as master, because this old servant is unworthy of that address,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Zi Ling wanted to say something. However, it seemed that she then recalled something, and decided to say nothing.</p>
 <p>Instead, she looked at Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, go on ahead. Your father is waiting for you.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart immediately thumped.</p>
 <p>“Zi Ling, my father is willing to meet me now?” Chu Feng did not dare to believe his own ears. After all, this was extremely important to him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be foolish. Go on in, that’s your father that’s waiting for you,” Zi Ling said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Very well,” Chu Feng nodded repeatedly. He was able to understand what Zi Ling meant by her words. His father must have wanted him to go in alone.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s heartbeat suddenly started to accelerate. He felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his throat.</p>
 <p>Over these years, Chu Feng had experienced all sorts of things, and set foot into all kinds of dangerous places.</p>
 <p>However, never had he ever been so nervous.</p>
 <p>‘Lord Father, exactly what sort of person is he?’</p>
 <p>‘Will he like me?’</p>
 <p>All sorts of questions began to hover in Chu Feng’s heart.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the dark scene before Chu Feng started to brighten. A stone table and two stone chairs appeared not far ahead of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, a middle-aged man was sitting on one of the stone chairs.</p>
 <p>That man was not very tall, robust or handsome. Especially his outfit; he was wearing very plain and unadorned clothing. It could be said that he appeared extremely ordinary.</p>
 <p>However, to Chu Feng, this man appeared very imposing. He was so imposing that simply no one could be compared with him.</p>
 <p>It was as if this man was the most powerful man in the world. Regardless of what other people thought, this was what Chu Feng felt.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng pays his respects to Lord Father.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng knelt onto the ground and respectfully kowtowed to the man before him. He knew… that the man before him was most definitely his father.</p>
 <p>After all, at that very moment, his bloodline’s power was throbbing.</p>
 <p>“We are father and son, not strangers. There is no need for you to do that sort of thing,” Once Chu Xuanyuan’s words left his mouth, Chu Feng actually started to float. Unable to control himself, Chu Feng started to float toward the stone chair beside Chu Xuanyuan.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that Chu Xuanyuan had simply not even moved. However… it was clear that the power that covered him was emitted by Chu Xuanyuan.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was brought to the stone chair and seated on it by that power.</p>
 <p>“You must be extremely wearied by your journey. You should eat some food to replenish your physical strength,” Chu Xuanyuan personally picked up a dimsum and handed it to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that dimsums and fruits covered the stone table. Although those dimsums and fruits were all very simple, they were all the things that Chu Feng loved to eat the most.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt a sniffle in his nose. He was able to tell that those things were… most definitely meticulously prepared by his father.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Lord Father,” As Chu Feng spoke, he received the dimsum his father had handed him.</p>
 <p>“Enough with the ‘Lord Father’. I am your father, and you are my son. You are my flesh. There is nothing more related than the two of us in this world.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, it would do if you just addressed me as ‘father’. There is no need for too much etiquette between father and son,” Chu Xuanyuan said with a light smile. His smile was filled with affection toward one’s child.</p>
 <p>“Yes, father.” At that moment, Chu Feng stopped acting reversed, and smiled with ease. Then, he bluntly grabbed a dimsum and took a large bite.</p>
 <p>It was not that Chu Feng was hungry. Merely, he wished to taste the dimsums that his father had prepared for him. The reason for that was because this was the first time he was eating something his biological father had prepared for him.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after the bite of dimsum entered his mouth, Chu Feng sensed a warm aura filling his entire body.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng, who had been feeling slightly exhausted, was immediately filled with energy and his face became radiant.</p>
 <p>That dimsum was absolutely not an ordinary dimsum. It contained a special sort of power that was much more effective than even the most powerful medicinal pellet Chu Feng possessed.</p>
 <p>That sort of dimsum, not to mention the Eastern Sea Region, was something that not even the people in the Holy Land of Martialism could possibly make. At that moment, Chu Feng felt the diligence of his father. The reason for that was because he knew that both the dimsums and the fruits were most definitely personally created by his father.</p>
