 <p><strong>Chapter 2712 - The Arrival Of A Calamity</strong></p>
 <p>“You want to deliberately cause a commotion?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, this Queen understands now.”</p>
 <p>Her Lady Queen was originally surprised. However, she revealed a look of sudden realization.</p>
 <p>“Boy, you’ve truly become smarter and smarter. This Queen has not educated you in vain,” Her Lady Queen said with a praising tone.</p>
 <p>However, her proud appearance made it seem like she was praising herself.</p>
 <p>It was clear that Eggy already knew what Chu Feng was planning to do.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had already offended the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.</p>
 <p>As for the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, they possessed great status in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>Although the strength of those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations could not amount to much in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, a place with experts like clouds, few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would dare to openly attack them.</p>
 <p>As for those that would dare to openly offend the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, they numbered even less.</p>
 <p>And Chu Feng had already offended the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. It was akin to having committed a capital offense.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew very well that those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations would definitely not drop the matter, that they would sooner or later seek him out for revenge.</p>
 <p>Thus, in such a situation, Chu Feng must quickly increase his cultivation. As an opportunity to attempt to breakthrough in his cultivation was before him, Chu Feng could not afford to miss it.</p>
 <p>And if he were to succeed?</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng succeeded, he would become a rank two True Immortal.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Xianshuo might be a rank four True Immortal, Chu Feng would gain the strength to fight him.</p>
 <p>That said, that was only part of the reason.</p>
 <p>Apart from that, Chu Feng wanted to deliberately cause a commotion.</p>
 <p>In a place like the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, if Chu Feng wanted to escape safely, just being able to contend against Chu Xianshuo would not be enough.</p>
 <p>After all, even if Chu Xianshuo was unable to take care of Chu Feng, it would still be possible for others to take care of him.</p>
 <p>After all, there were countless people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm who wanted to flatter the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>At such a time, Chu Feng needed to reveal his strength. Only by revealing how extraordinary he was would he be able to bring fear to others.</p>
 <p>That was why he wanted to cause a commotion. He wanted everyone to know that he, Chu Feng, was not a nobody.</p>
 <p>If anyone wanted to take care of him, they must first weigh themselves.</p>
 <p>As for the appearance of the Divine Tribulation’s lightning, it would serve as the best commotion.</p>
 <p>“While the plan is good, I do not know whether or not I will actually be able to reach a breakthrough,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Who cares if you succeed or not? Just try it out first. After all, you have enough time,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>“Mn, that’s what I’m thinking too.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Chu Feng sat on the ground and began to attempt reaching a breakthrough in his cultivation. He began to attack the bottleneck to rank two True Immortal.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>A vast crowd was present outside the hunting ground. After all, those that were unable to successfully enter the hunting ground were still there.</p>
 <p>There were also a lot of people that had gathered there purely to observe.</p>
 <p>They were all waiting for the arrival of the tenth day. They all wanted to see whether or not Chu Xianshuo would be able to successfully obtain first place for the tenth year in a row.</p>
 <p>Thus, the main character in the hunt was none other than Chu Xianshuo.</p>
 <p>However, even at this moment, Chu Xianshuo had not yet entered the hunting ground. He was relaxing atop the viewing platform like an observer.</p>
 <p>His leisurely appearance revealed his confidence. He seemed to possess absolute certainty in being able to obtain first place in the hunt.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, ear-splitting rumbles sounded from the sky.</p>
 <p>As the rumbles were heard, the ground started to tremble. It was as if the earth itself was feeling fear.</p>
 <p>After the thunderous rumbles were heard, dazzling nine-colored lightning began to emerge high up in the ninth heaven.</p>
 <p>That nine-colored lightning resembled enormous dragons as they surged about in the sky.</p>
 <p>It was as if even space itself was being torn apart.</p>
 <p>At that moment, night had already fallen. Thus, that nine-colored lightning looked especially dazzling.</p>
 <p>Even the earth itself was brightly lit.</p>
 <p>But, that nine-colored lightning was clearly still so high up in the sky that no one should have been able to see it.</p>
 <p>“Nine-colored Divine Lightning, this is… a Heavenly Bloodline possessor is about to reach a breakthrough.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd present all turned their gazes toward the sky. Shock filled their faces.</p>
 <p>Actually, there were other Heavenly Clans in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>While the people of those Heavenly Clans could not compare to those of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would still give rise to the magnificent abnormal sign of the nine-colored lightning whenever their clansmen reached a breakthrough in cultivation.</p>
 <p>Thus, very few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm had not witnessed the nine-colored lightning before.</p>
 <p>In fact, to a lot of people present, this sort of abnormal sign was no longer a wondrous sight. After all, they had truly witnessed a lot of them already.</p>
 <p>However, the abnormal sign that had appeared in the sky at this moment caused everyone to turn their gazes up to see.</p>
 <p>It was as if it were a rarely-seen magnificent sight that all the crowd wanted to witness.</p>
 <p>In fact, all of the people present… had expressions of shock in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! The divine lightning in the sky seems capable of tearing even space itself to shreds. It is simply too shocking. I have never witnessed such an abnormal sign before.”</p>
 <p>“Exactly who is going to reach a breakthrough? It couldn’t possibly be that a grand character from the Chu Heavenly Clan is about to reach a breakthrough, right?”</p>
 <p>Soon, all kinds of exclamations of surprise began to be heard from the crowd. Furthermore, they all came to determine that it was a Chu Heavenly Clansman.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because there were people in the Chu Heavenly Clan that trained in very powerful Self-Punishment Mysterious Techniques.</p>
 <p>Thus, those people would bring about extraordinary abnormal signs when breaking through.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about the Chu Heavenly Clan, practically everyone started to involuntarily look to Chu Xianshuo, who was on the viewing platform.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? How could there be such frightening divine lightning?”</p>
 <p>Chu Xianshuo was frowning slightly. Confusion and bewilderment were present in his eyes.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because even he, a Chu Heavenly Clansman, had never witnessed such a terrifying sight before.</p>
 <p>He had no idea what could have caused the sudden divine lightning.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, another loud explosion was heard. The nine-colored lightnings started to fuse with one another. They formed a single nine-colored lightning and started to strike straight down from the sky.</p>
 <p>“Oh no! It seems that divine lightning is coming here!” Someone cried out in alarm.</p>
 <p>“You’re kidding! How could it be coming toward us? Even if it’s someone grand from the Chu Heavenly Clan that is about to reach a breakthrough, they couldn’t possibly have entered closed-door training here, right?” Someone voiced their doubts.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s coming straight for us. That divine lightning is coming straight for us.”</p>
 <p>However, as that nine-colored divine lightning approached, the crowd grew even more certain that it was going to strike them.</p>
 <p>As the nine-colored divine lightning grew closer and closer, the trembling of the earth grew more and more intense.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the crowd also started to feel extremely frightened.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they were all able to sense a devastating power from the nine-colored divine lightning.</p>
 <p>It was as if all of them here would end up dying and the entire region would be turned to ashes should that lightning strike.</p>
 <p>“No, this sensation, it’s strange!”</p>
 <p>“This is simply not an abnormal sign of someone reaching a breakthrough in cultivation! This is the descent of a calamity!”</p>
 <p>“Everyone, run away! Run away!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm. At the same time, there were people that soared into the sky and began to flee.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Is it really a calamity?!”</p>
 <p>“Everyone, run away! Stop watching it! If we do not escape now, we will all end up dying here!”</p>
 <p>The next moment, a lot of people shouted those sorts of words. The crowd gathered there burst into an utter uproar.</p>
 <p>Many people soared into the sky and revealed their strongest techniques to flee with their fastest speed.</p>
 <p>They firmly believed that it was not an abnormal sign caused by the breakthrough of a possessor of a heavenly bloodline.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the aura of the nine-colored lightning was simply too frightening. The destructive impact caused the crowd to feel fear from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
 <p>Never had they ever witnessed such frightening lightning before. Thus, they determined that it was the descent of a calamity.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when the crowd were all panicky, the divine lightning that was about to strike down upon the entire region suddenly disappeared.</p>
 <p>After the divine lightning that was striking down disappeared, the lightning in the sky also started to gradually vanish. The ear-splitting thunder also started to gradually wane.</p>
 <p>Even the trembling of the earth started to grow weaker.</p>
 <p>At that moment, all the people, both those that had already escaped and those that were planning to escape, all stopped.</p>
 <p>Everyone, both reputed experts and nameless members of the younger generation, turned their heads to the sky.</p>
 <p>On their faces were the same sort of expression.</p>
 <p>Bewilderment!!!</p>
