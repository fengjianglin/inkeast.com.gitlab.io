 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1803 - Inescapable Net</strong></p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Zhang Ming said, “Tianyi, Chu Feng has made his resolution. You should stop urging him against it,”</p>
 <p>After hearing what Zhang Tianyi’s father said, Chu Feng’s eyes narrowed slightly. Chu Feng was already able to tell that while Zhang Tianyi wanted him to stay, his father didn’t seem to want him to stay.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not blame him for it. Instead, he felt very relieved. After all, regardless of what sort of relationship Zhang Tianyi had with him, Zhang Tianyi’s father still had to consider Zhang Tianyi’s well-being first and foremost.</p>
 <p>Let alone, as the competition had ended, Zhang Tianyi’s father could have totally just immediately opened the fort and allowed everyone to exit directly. However, he had not done so. Instead, he had everyone return through the same path they had come from. The actual reason why he did that was actually so that he could help Chu Feng obtain the opportunity to escape.</p>
 <p>No matter what, Chu Feng felt that Zhang Tianyi’s father was a pretty decent person. He did not do anything that he shouldn’t have, and had done all that he should to help Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, the White-browed Immortal, with the help of many experts, has set up an inescapable net outside of the fort over the past couple days.”</p>
 <p>“I know that your World Spirit Techniques are very strong. However, no matter what, that White-browed Immortal is still a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. You might not necessarily be able to break through his world spirit techniques.”</p>
 <p>“However, if you have this with you, you will be able to escape from the White-browed Immortal’s spirit formation without him knowing about it,” Zhang Ming handed a paper talisman to Chu Feng. This was no ordinary paper talisman. Contained within this paper talisman was a very powerful unsealing formation. It would be able to break the White-browed Immortal’s spirit formation without alerting him so that Chu Feng could escape.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, Zhang Tianyi’s father’s world spirit techniques were extremely powerful. At the very least, his world spirit techniques were more powerful than those of the White-browed Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng did not refuse. He felt that that paper talisman would really be able to help him.</p>
 <p>“This is all that I can do,” Zhang Ming said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, this junior appreciates your kind intentions.”</p>
 <p>“Senior, senior brother Zhang, farewell,” Then, Chu Feng left this place alongside Yan Xie and the others.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, quickly escape. All of the traps and mechanisms here have been sealed. We will be able to go out by ourselves.”</p>
 <p>“However, you’re different. At this moment, the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans must be present at all of the exits of the fort waiting for you to go out. If you are to exit alongside us, you will definitely be captured.”</p>
 <p>“It’s better that you exit by yourself. Take advantage of the current situation and leave with the crowd,” Yan Xie said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng clasped his fist and said, “In that case, everyone, I hope that we will see each other again,”</p>
 <p>“Farewell,” Yan Xie, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish also clasped their fists toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he turned into a ray of light that began to rapidly proceed toward the central region’s exit.</p>
 <p>What Yan Xie had said was very true. The best method for Chu Feng to escape would be to hide within a large group of people.</p>
 <p>This was especially true should he hide among the people from the Three Palaces. No matter how arrogant and despotic the Four Clans might be, they would not dare to do anything to the people from the Three Palaces.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Outside of the fort. The people from the Four Great Imperial Clans, regardless of whether they were concealing themselves or not, were all standing tightly in their respective formation locations. Massive forces were present all around. They were all staring fixedly at the various exits.</p>
 <p>However, the exits were still shut. Even now, they were not open. As of now, not a single person had exited the fort.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng had already arrived at the location of the exit from the central region. Merely, he had concealed his aura and hidden his body within the air. No one knew that he had already arrived at the exit.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, he was able to see the current situation. Although only twenty people had been able to enter the center of the fort, there were an innumerable number of people that had entered the fort itself. At this moment, all of those people were still present in this place.</p>
 <p>These people would be the cover for Chu Feng to exit this place.</p>
 <p>“Senior Zhang is truly benevolent to me.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng saw the exit gates that were still tightly closed, as well as the crowd from the various powers, he knew that Zhang Tianyi’s father had not opened the exits. He was deliberately keeping those people inside so that they could provide cover for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the exits started to open. Right after Chu Feng arrived, the exits were opened. This verified Chu Feng’s guess. Everything was under Zhang Tianyi’s father’s, Zhang Ming’s, control.</p>
 <p>After the exits were opened, the crowd began to rush outward. As for Chu Feng, he had sneaked himself into the crowd from the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, Chu Feng had already clashed with the Heavenly Law Palace. Although his conflict with them was not deep, it remained that there had been conflicts between them. Chu Feng felt that no one would anticipate that he will hide himself among the crowd from the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>“Sure enough, they’ve actually really sealed this region off,” Chu Feng used his Heaven’s Eyes to observe the outside, and discovered that the Four Clans had indeed set up a layer of invisible spirit formations outside the fort, sealing it.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, it was not only a sealing formation. There was also a detection formation. As long as someone used a world spirit formation, that detection spirit formation would be able to detect it immediately. Voice transmission talismans, connection talismans and various other talismans were all unable to be used.</p>
 <p>Although the Four Great Imperial Clans had set up many spirit formations, it was clear that they could not trap everyone here. Thus, the Four Great Imperial Clans left many exits in their spirit formations. Merely, these exits were all tightly guarded. Not only were Martial Emperors present at these exits, there were also world spiritists there as well.</p>
 <p>It seemed that the Four Great Imperial Clans were planning to inspect the crowd one by one so that Chu Feng could not escape.</p>
 <p>“There’s quite a few experts from the Three Palaces here. I refuse to believe that your Four Clans will dare to publicly inspect the people from the Heavenly Law Palace,” Chu Feng sneered. No matter how strong the Four Clans might be, they would not dare to disrespect the Three Palaces. Thus, even though the Four Clans had set up an inescapable net, Chu Feng was still certain of being able to escape.</p>
 <p>“Help! Senior, save me!!!”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly heard a shout.</p>
 <p>That voice came from another exit. As the exits were quite a distance from one another, and there were a lot of people present at this place, which caused the entire place to be filled with noise, it should have been impossible for Chu Feng to hear a cry for help.</p>
 <p>However, that voice was extremely special and familiar. The reason for that was because… that was Chu Feng’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Help me! Help me!!!”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t you think you can escape today!!!”</p>
 <p>A person was rapidly fleeing in the direction the voice had sounded from. There were many people pursuing him.</p>
 <p>As the people from behind pursued him, they were unleashing martial skills to kill the person escaping.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, quickly look, it’s Chu Feng!!! That man is Chu Feng! There are people chasing after him to kill him!”</p>
 <p>More and more people noticed this scene. All those that noticed this scene were startled.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the person that was fleeing was none other than Chu Feng. Merely, he was a fake. Although he was a fake, he appeared to be very real. It was simply impossible for ordinary people to be able to distinguish him as a fake. Not to mention ordinary people, even a lot of the people close to Chu Feng would not be able to distinguish that the Chu Feng that was fleeing was a fake.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I shall see where you can escape.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the people from the Four Clans that were guarding the surrounding exits began to rapidly fly over. From all directions, they began to surround that fake Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief was the first to arrive. He unleashed his overwhelming Emperor’s might and suppressed the fake Chu Feng. Then, with one hand, he grabbed onto the fake Chu Feng’s neck and pulled him upward. While gnashing his teeth angrily, he said, “Chu Feng, are you prepared to die?!”</p>
 <p>“Ah! It’s the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief. Is he really going to kill Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>“A genius like Chu Feng, is he really going to fall like this?”</p>
 <p>The crowd did not know that the Chu Feng that the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief was holding was a fake. They all thought that the actual Chu Feng had been captured. Seeing that Chu Feng was about to be killed, the crowd all began to express their regret.</p>
 <p>“What treachery. They actually found someone to disguise as me.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was frowning deeply. The reason for that was because his impersonator’s disguise was truly too good. Chu Feng was afraid that Baili Xuankong would fall for it.</p>
 <p>As the Four Great Imperial Clans had set up an inescapable net, Chu Feng did not dare to use many special techniques to contact Baili Xuankong, as they would reveal him.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about it, Chu Feng believed that the Four Great Imperial Clans had done this deliberately. They had already planned to use this sort of method to lure Baili Xuankong out.</p>
 <p>Then, using Baili Xuankong, they would lure Chu Feng out as well.</p>
