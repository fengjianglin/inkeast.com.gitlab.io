 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1242 - Please Leave</strong></p>
 <p>After such a long period of time, Tao Xiangyu had yet to do anything. As for the other disciples of the Punishment Department, they did not do anything either.</p>
 <p>This sort of situation caused many people to think that Tao Xiangyu and the the Punishment Department had sensed Chu Feng’s unbounded potential, did not wish to create a major hatred between them, and had thus decided to endure this pent-up unspoken grievance.</p>
 <p>However, those people were wrong. On the eleventh day after the battle between Chu Feng and Tao Xiangyu, an unprecedented major event happened in the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Head, it’s bad.”</p>
 <p>Currently Chu Feng was chatting with Bai Ruochen and the other original members of the Asura Division when an Asura Division’s member suddenly rushed in.</p>
 <p>This person was not wearing the Asura Division’s armband. However, he was most definitely a member of the Asura Division. The reason why he was not wearing the armband was because Chu Feng had ordered him not to.</p>
 <p>That was because he was the Asura Division’s intelligence gatherer. In order to protect the safety of the Asura Division’s members, Chu Feng had placed all of them in his own territory and would only send some members with relatively decent strength out to gather information. As for the person that had just returned, he was one of them.</p>
 <p>When they saw the flustered and alarmed expression of this man, the expressions of everyone in the palace hall, including even Bai Ruochen, became serious.</p>
 <p>In an instant, an atmosphere of unrest filled the palace hall. Everyone was able to guess what had happened.</p>
 <p>“Don’t panic. What happened? Tell us as it is,” Chu Feng said calmly.</p>
 <p>“Reporting to the Head, the Peach Immortal Division has started to move. Practically all of their members have set off. And not only the Peach Immortal Division, the Heaven Inquiring Division,</p>
 <p>Yanyu’s Division, Jingan’s Division and the Beast King Division have all set out as well. They are currently attacking the territories of our Asura Division’s members.”</p>
 <p>“Even though none of our members are in their territories, they showed no quarter and have destroyed all of the buildings within those territories. Furthermore, they have given word that the final territory that they will be destroying will be yours, our Asura Division’s headquarters,” replied that member.</p>
 <p>“What? All those branch power organizations have joined hands to attack our Asura Division?” When they heard those words, the complexion of the tense crowd turned ashen.</p>
 <p>That was because the branch power organizations that that member spoke of were several of the Cyanwood Mountain’s most powerful branch power organizations. Especially the Heaven Inquiring Division; they were the Cyanwood Mountain’s number one branch power organization, which had gathered countless geniuses and numerous powerful individuals.</p>
 <p>“In that case, what about their heads? Who among their heads have moved out for us?” Bai Ruochen asked.</p>
 <p>“The Heaven Inquiring Division’s head, Qin Mowen, is still in closed-door training.”</p>
 <p>“However, their second head, Bai Yunxiao, has come.”</p>
 <p>“As for the other branch power organizations, all of their heads have been dispatched,” that member replied.</p>
 <p>“Putong.” At this moment, everyone sucked in a mouthful of cold air. There were even some who directly fell to the ground and fainted from the shock.</p>
 <p>The second head of the Heaven Inquiring Division, Bai Yunxiao, ranked fourth on the Cyanwood Succession List.</p>
 <p>The head of Yanyu’s Division, Qi Yanyu, ranked fifth on the Cyanwood Succession List.</p>
 <p>The head of Jingang’s Division, Zhao Jingang, ranked sixth on the Cyanwood Succession List.</p>
 <p>The head of the Peach Immortal Division, Tao Xiangyu, ranked seventh on the Cyanwood Succession List.</p>
 <p>The head of the Beast King Division, Ben Leihu[1.Fierce Thunder Tiger], ranked eighth on the Cyanwood Succession List.</p>
 <p>Other than the first three ranks and the ninth rank, all of the people on the Cyannwood Succession List had set out.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they were not alone; they had also led their powerful branch power organizations with them. As such, how could the crowd not be afraid?</p>
 <p>To speak in simpler terms, the current Asura Division was no longer just enemies with a single Peach Immortal Division, they had become the enemy of all of the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples.</p>
 <p>As such, how could ordinary disciples possibly be able to accept this fact? To them, this was simply a road to disaster.</p>
 <p>“Heh, truly ruthless. It would seem that they truly plan to kill me, Chu Feng.” At this moment, Chu Feng suddenly laughed. Even though he had a smile on his face, his eyes were radiating killing intent.</p>
 <p>Not all of the heads of these branch power organizations were members of the Punishment Department. Logically, even Tao Xiangyu would not be able to get all of them to move. That was because all of the disciples on the Cyanwood Succession List were rivals with one another.</p>
 <p>Yet now, regardless of what reasons they had, all of them had gathered to deal with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, it remained that they had gathered. Furthermore, they were attacking Chu Feng’s Asura Division.</p>
 <p>The demon-level characters on the Cyanwood Succession List joining hands to deal with a single new disciple, this was unprecedented in the history of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>Why exactly did they do this? Chu Feng was naturally able to guess the reason.</p>
 <p>It was most definitely because they felt Chu Feng to be a threat and wanted to eliminate him at an earlier time by beating him down so that he could not rise.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was disinclined to bother thinking about these things. That was because all of these people would become his enemies after today. This was already the truth, something that could not be changed.</p>
 <p>“Head, what do we do now?” At this moment, everyone turned their gaze to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Gather all of our Asura Division’s brothers and sisters,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>After this, an alarm bell sounded. The members of the Asura Division that were already prepared rapidly assembled on the Asura Division’s plaza following the sound.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng explained their current situation to them. As Chu Feng had anticipated, after the members found out about this, the majority of their complexions turned ashen, as if doomsday was coming.</p>
 <p>They had thought that a calamity might befall the Asura Division. However, they never imagined that it would be this severe, so severe that they were incapable of accepting it.</p>
 <p>“Head, what do we do now? How about, how about we go and find the elders of the Medicine Concocting Department for help? Otherwise, they’ll soon come killing over. At that time, we’ll be unable to resist them at all.”</p>
 <p>As expected, many members were unable to face the truth, and turned their hopes to the elders and wanted the elders to protect them.</p>
 <p>“This is a battle between disciples. Request help from the elders? How disgraceful could you be?” However, there were also disciples who despised this sort of method.</p>
 <p>Bai Ruochen spoke. “If the people who were coming were ordinary disciples, the problem would naturally be able to be solved by finding elders. However, the ones coming right now are not ordinary disciples. Other than the management elders, who would dare to meddle in this?”</p>
 <p>“Thus, it is better for everyone to not think about that. Since we’ve joined the Asura Division, we should then play our part as members of the Asura Division. Regardless of whether you’re willing or not, you must meet the enemy head-on, because this is a battle concerning our honor.”</p>
 <p>After hearing what Bai Ruochen said, everyone grew silent. After all, Bai Ruochen was someone with status in the Asura Division. Other than Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen was the person with the most power.</p>
 <p>However, who would want to fight with those people? Fighting them would simply be akin to bringing about their own destruction!</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone cast their gazes toward Chu Feng once again. They were waiting for Chu Feng to make his decision.</p>
 <p>“Firstly, I want to thank everyone for sticking to our Asura Division even after knowing that a major enemy will be coming. I thank every single one of you here. Whether you may or may not be scared, prepared to fight or wanting to retreat, I will still thank all of you.”</p>
 <p>“However, it remains that this calamity was brought to us by me, Chu Feng. I, Chu Feng, do not wish to implicate everyone.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I will now be declaring one thing. I hope that everyone here is able to cooperate with me.”</p>
 <p>“I hope that all of you will withdraw from the Asura Division and leave this place,” Chu Feng spoke with a smile on his face.</p>
