 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1090 - Do You Dare To Enter?</strong></p>
 <p>“Elder Zhou, how long are we to wait?” Asked Sikong Zhaixing.</p>
 <p>“Before dusk should do.” Replied Elder Zhou.</p>
 <p>“Before dusk?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was stunned. One must know that the sun has just risen. To wait till dusk, won’t that be waiting for an entire day?</p>
 <p>“Elder Zhou, we merely need to enter the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda. We would not affect their training; can we not enter it now?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid you cannot. Once this formation is activated, they cannot be agitated at all. If they are to be agitated, it would be very easy for them to damage their bodies. That is not a responsibility I could bear.” Elder Zhou refused in a very firm manner.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng wanted to say something more. However, before he could say anything, Sikong Zhaixing rushed to say. “During training, one’s safety is the most important. We can wait here.”</p>
 <p>“Mn, Headmaster Sikong is very reasonable. Since this is the case, you two can continue to wait here. I still have matters to take care of, so I cannot keep you two accompany.”</p>
 <p>After Elder Zhou said those words, he waved his large sleeve and left. Before he left the place, he even cast a glance at Chu Feng. It was clear that he felt a bit unhappy by what Chu Feng said earlier.</p>
 <p>“It’s one thing for their Sectmaster to not come and greet us, but for a mere management elder to be this arrogant. Sigh, your Southern Cyanwood Forest is truly looked down upon by others.” At this moment, Eggy was unable to watch by idly anymore and spoke out.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured. Since I have entered the Southern Cyanwood Forest, I am now a disciple of the Southern Cyanwood Forest. There will definitely be a day that I will make these people who look down upon our Southern Cyanwood Forest regret their deeds.” Said Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Heh, I know about your abilities. As long as your growth continues, what could a mere Ascension Sect like this be worth.”</p>
 <p>“But I truly do not understand that old fart by the name of Baili Xuankong. Wouldn’t it be fine if he directly taught the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s disciples his skills and techniques? Why must he make things so troublesome?” Said Eggy in a very puzzled manner.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps this might be the brilliance of Senior Baili. Perhaps even he is uncertain whether the Southern Cyanwood Forest could wait till the day where the person he hoped to appear would appear. That might be the reason why he did not develop the Southern Cyanwood Forest excessively.”</p>
 <p>“The reason why he made all these things this troublesome is actually pretty simple. It’s not that he did not leave anything behind; instead, all that he had left behind is only obtainable by the person that he was waiting for.” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Heh, very well. Your Lady Queen will await your performance. I hope that you do not disappoint that old fart Baili Xuankong. Hehe…” Eggy laughed sweetly and then stopped speaking anymore.</p>
 <p>After this, Chu Feng began a long journey of wait with Sikong Zhaixing.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that this place was a forbidden area where ordinary elders and disciples were not allowed to enter, their wait turned out to be pretty quiet and comfortable.</p>
 <p>Finally, the sun began to set toward the west. A blazing color of sunset began to appear from the western horizon.</p>
 <p>At this moment, those ninety-nine disciples from the Ascension Sect whose eyes were closed began to open their eyes. The formation stopped, their training was complete.</p>
 <p>“Who are you two? Why are you here?” When they saw Chu Feng and Sikong Zhaixing, surprised expressions appeared in their eyes. However, soon, the surprise was replaced with alertness.</p>
 <p>“Little friends, this old one is the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster, Sikong Zhaixing. As for him, he’s my disciple, Chu Feng.” Introduced Sikong Zhaixing.</p>
 <p>“Oh? So it’s actually the headmaster of the Southern Cyanwood Forest, Senior Sikong. Is there something that brought you two here?”</p>
 <p>Upon knowing Sikong Zhaixing’s identity, the attitudes of these disciples became a bit better. At the very least, they were not that alert anymore. However, their tones did not contain any trace of respect towards one’s elders. It appeared much like they were talking with someone of their generation.</p>
 <p>“Little friends, we have come here so that my sect’s disciple Chu Feng could enter into the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda to retrieve an item.” Sikong Zhaixing said.</p>
 <p>“Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda? Senior Sikong, might you have been mistaken? This Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda is our Ascension Sect’s forbidden area. Outsiders are not allowed to enter it.” A rank two Martial King male said.</p>
 <p>“What? Your Ascension Sect’s forbidden area? Could it be that your Sectmaster has not informed you all of who it was that constructed this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda? Could it be that you all cannot see the name of the pagoda, Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda?” Seeing this, Chu Feng asked with a loud voice.</p>
 <p>“Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda is constructed by your Southern Cyanwood Forest’s first headmaster, Baili Xuankong. However, what does this have to do with your Southern Cyanwood Forest?” That same male asked in response.</p>
 <p>“Since this place is constructed by our Southern Cyanwood Forest’s ancestors, it is naturally our Southern Cyanwood Forest’s possession.” Chu Feng responded.</p>
 <p>“Those words you’ve spoken are mistaken. The treasures in this world are countless. However, regardless of who created the treasures, the ownership lies in who possessed those treasures.”</p>
 <p>“Currently, this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda is located in our Ascension Sect and not in your Southern Cyanwood Forest. For you to say that this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda is yours, why don’t you go ahead and say that our entire Ascension Sect is yours?” Refuted that disciple with a cold voice.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. We’ve seen shameless before, but never have we seen someone as shameless as you.” At this time, the ninety-nine disciples present all displayed displeased expressions and actually began to publicly insult Chu Feng. Moreover, as they spoke, they stood in two rows and blocked the entrance of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.</p>
 <p>“Little friends, as for who is the owner of this Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda, it is something that your Sectmaster knows and not something that you all could decide. Today, I have come here after obtaining Elder Zhou’s approval. Little friends, I request that you all move aside.” Right at this moment, Sikong Zhaixing spoke out.</p>
 <p>At this moment, his tone was no longer as good-natured as before. It even contained a trace of anger. That was because he did not expect that while the elders here did not make things difficult for them, the disciples actually did.</p>
 <p>With the difference between these disciples and his strength and status, they should not have done something like this. Yet, they actually used sophistry to declare that the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda was theirs. This made it so that Sikong Zhaixing was unable to tolerate it anymore.</p>
 <p>“Elder Zhou?” Upon hearing the name of Elder Zhou, those disciples were startled. However, they did not become afraid. Instead, they said.</p>
 <p>“We cannot merely believe in your words alone. Since you said it’s Elder Zhou who brought you here, then go and bring over Elder Zhou. If Elder Zhou truly agreed to let you all in, then we will also step aside and let you in. Otherwise, we will not let you enter into the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.”</p>
 <p>“You all…” Hearing those words, even Sikong Zhaixing was thoroughly enraged. However, in the end, he decided to endure. He then turned to Chu Feng and said, “Wait for me here. I will be right back.”</p>
 <p>After he finished saying those words, Sikong Zhaixing’s body moved and flew out. He had most likely gone to find Elder Zhou.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, look at what sort of moral conduct these disciples possess. That Elder Zhou ought to know about them. For him to not explain to them and bring you two here and leaving right after, in my opinion, he is deliberately making things difficult for you two.”</p>
 <p>“As expected, this Ascension Sect is not that easy to deal with. Let’s not talk about whether they will comply with their ancestor’s promise after you’ve obtained the keepsake, they are refusing to even give you the opportunity to obtain the keepsake.” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“It’s alright, I have my means.” Chu Feng lightly smiled. A chilliness flashed through his eyes. Then, he waved his sleeve, fluttering his gown and brought forth a majestic golden spirit formation. With a few more movements from Chu Feng, an enormous spirit formation palace appeared outside of the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s Pagoda.</p>
 <p>“What is that guy doing?” The disciples of the Ascension Sect were surprised by Chu Feng’s actions.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Stop your movements! What do you take this place to be? You must know that this place is our Ascension Sect’s forbidden area, not somewhere that you can casually create spirit formations at.” There were even people who began to directly criticize Chu Feng and even had intentions to act to stop him.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng completely ignored them. Only when he completely finished the construction of his spirit formation palace did he walk to the gate of the palace and say while pointing to the group of Ascension Sect’s disciples, “You bunch of trash who believe yourself to be infallible, do you dare to enter?”</p>
