 <p><strong> Chapter 2119 - Chu Heavenly Clan</strong></p>
 <p>“In that case, how was it discovered that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan all have black hair. However, Ying Chong has brown hair. This caused my subordinates to be wary of him. After making inquiries, they came to know about Ying Chong’s true identity.”</p>
 <p>“However, master, please rest assured. Although Yin Chong tried to be clever only to end up with an egg on his face, he does not know the true reason why we are here.”</p>
 <p>“He felt the entire time that we were subdued by his Heavenly Bloodline, and recognized him as our master because of that,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“However, it remains that he has discovered you all. Thus, why have you all not killed him? Do you all not fear that he will spread news of you all when he leaves?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“If he were someone from the Holy Land of Martialism, we would not have spared him regardless of who he might be. However, it remains that he is from the Outer World.”</p>
 <p>“We do not know a lot about the Outer World. All we know is that there are a lot of experts in the Outer World.”</p>
 <p>“While we are not people that are afraid of death, we did not wish to invite troubles for our masters. After all, the Chu Heavenly Clan is also located in the Outer World.”</p>
 <p>“That is why we decided to accept our error and adapt to it. We ended up letting Ying Chong leave. However, master, please rest assured, we never helped Ying Chong with anything,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“The Dark Hall’s Hall Master has done all sorts of evil. He absolutely cannot be spared,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“If master wants to kill him, he will absolutely not be allowed to live. Merely, as master is wearied in the journey here, you should first properly rest yourself now that you’ve returned home.”</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow, I will cripple that Ying Chong’s cultivation on master’s behalf. Then, master can personally take him away and behead him before the people of the Holy Land of Martialism,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“Very well,” Chu Feng expressed his approval. After all, killing the Dark Hall’s Hall Master here and publicly executing the Dark Hall’s Hall Master possessed completely different connotations.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, should he kill the Dark Hall’s Hall Master before the people of the Holy Land of Martialism, he would be able to bring ease to their hearts and let them be certain that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had died.</p>
 <p>After that, Chu Feng asked the blind old man some more questions.</p>
 <p>Among them was the question of whether or not there was a formation that could lead to the Outer World in this place.</p>
 <p>The result was as Chu Feng had anticipated. There was indeed a formation that lead to the Outer World in the Realm of Gods. That spirit formation was called… the ‘Stairway to Heaven.’</p>
 <p>“Did Qing Xuantian leave the Holy Land of Martialism through the Stairway to Heaven?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that it was definitely impossible for Qing Xuantian to have secluded himself in the mountains because if he had, he would have definitely revealed himself after the recent events had occurred.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had learned from the Four Great Divine Beasts that Qing Xuantian was not very old when he became the overlord of the Holy Land of Martialism. He had only been a member of the younger generation.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng had deduced that he should not have died. Even if he had been afflicted with some sort of illness, he should still be alive. That was the premonition Chu Feng had.</p>
 <p>However, if Qing Xuantian was still alive, he would definitely not be in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>If he was no longer in the Holy Land of Martialism, it would mean that he had entered the Outer World.</p>
 <p>However, if he had entered the Outer World, then, at that time… the Stairway to Heaven in the Misty Peak should have yet to be discovered.</p>
 <p>Thus, the only way there should be a Stairway to Heaven in the Realm of Gods.</p>
 <p>“Qing Xuantian was indeed here ten thousand years ago. He had also wanted to use the Stairway to Heaven.”</p>
 <p>“His cultivation at that time… was rank one Half Martial Ancestor.”</p>
 <p>“With that level of cultivation, he would naturally not be a match for me. Thus, we naturally refused him,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you know where he went afterwards?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I do not know,” The blind old man shook his head.</p>
 <p>“In that case, did a woman come here over a dozen years ago to request the usage of the Stairway to Heaven?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Master, actually, when you were in the Elf Kingdom that time, this old servant was also there.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, this old man heard the entire conversation between you and the Elf King.”</p>
 <p>“We know that the Elf King had entered our Realm of Gods over a dozen years ago. Merely… we do not know anything about Xian Miaomiao’s mother,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, Xian Miaomiao’s mother did not come to the Stairway to Heaven here?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“If the Stairway to Heaven is activated, it will give off an enormous reaction. It would be impossible for us to miss it,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“I understand,” Chu Feng asked no more questions. He knew that the blind old man would not deceive him.</p>
 <p>However, he kept feeling that Qing Xuantian and Xian Miaomiao’s mother should have definitely left this place.</p>
 <p>‘Since they didn’t use the Stairway to Heaven here, could it be that they’ve truly used the Misty Peak’s Stairway to Heaven?’</p>
 <p>‘Or could it be that they’ve managed to find other ways to leave this place?’ Chu Feng pondered.</p>
 <p>Afterward, Chu Feng chatted with the blind old man for a long time. The reason for that was because Chu Feng had a whole lot of questions.</p>
 <p>It was not only questions about the Chu Heavenly Clan’s past; Chu Feng was even very curious as to how the blind old man had taught Zi Ling and the others.</p>
 <p>As they chatted, time passed by extremely fast. The bright day turned into night in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>During that period of time, per Chu Feng’s orders, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was tied up and sent to their prison.</p>
 <p>The Dark Hall’s Hall Master was no fool. As matters stood, he had realized that the people of this place deemed him their master back then because they had mistaken him for someone else.</p>
 <p>Their actual master was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Thus, he was depressed to discover that the person that had entered the tigers’ den today was not Chu Feng. Instead, it was him.</p>
 <p>“Why would it be like this? I am truly too unlucky.”</p>
 <p>“No, that Chu Feng is surnamed Chu. Could he be from the Chu Heavenly Clan?”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s most definitely a coincidence. How could that guy be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?”</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that the people of this place refused to speak with the Dark Hall’s Hall Master, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master did not know about Chu Feng’s actual identity, and could only make wild guesses.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a female’s voice was suddenly heard. “What’s wrong? When you mentioned the Chu Heavenly Clan, you revealed a trace of fear in your eyes. Could the Chu Heavenly Clan be very powerful in the Outer World?”</p>
 <p>When that voice was heard, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master immediately revealed an overjoyed expression.</p>
 <p>Then, spiritedly, he looked at his surroundings. After discovering that he was not being monitored, he said happily, “Xue Ji, it’s you. You’ve returned. How was it? What did you manage to discover? Am I able to escape?”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>After the Dark Hall’s Hall Master said those words, black gaseous flames suddenly appeared from thin air in his cell. After the black gaseous flames appeared, they hovered before the Dark Hall’s Hall Master and turned into an exceptional beauty.</p>
 <p>That beauty was Xue Ji.</p>
 <p>After seeing Xue Ji, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master asked impatiently, “Xue Ji, quickly, say something. Exactly how was it? Are we able to escape?”</p>
 <p>“There is a Stairway to Heaven here. We can enter the Outer World through the Stairway to Heaven,” Xue Ji said.</p>
 <p>“Great, this is great. The heavens are helping me,” Hearing those words, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was overjoyed. Then, his gaze turned cold. Fiercely, he exclaimed, “After returning to the Outer World, I’ll inform my clansmen of the things that happened here. At that time, these ignorant fools will suffer.”</p>
 <p>“However, if they are people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, would your clansmen even bother to deal with them after you tell them what you’ve encountered here?” Xue Ji asked.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was startled. His gaze became extremely complicated. Cautiously, he asked, “What did you manage to scout out? Chu Feng… he couldn’t possibly really be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, right? Could this place be constructed by the Chu Heavenly Clan?”</p>
 <p>“This place is a remnant of the Chu Heavenly Clan. As for Chu Feng… he is precisely a descendant of the Chu Heavenly Clan,” Xue Ji said.</p>
 <p>“He’s really someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?!”</p>
 <p>“No, why would it be like this?!”</p>
 <p>“Why would it turn out like this?!”</p>
 <p>After hearing what Xue Ji said, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s expression immediately changed. He became extremely emotional. Contained within his eyes… was the emotion of despair.</p>
