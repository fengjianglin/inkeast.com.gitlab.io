 <p><strong> Chapter 2448 - Presumptuous Request</strong></p>
 <p>“As for what happened later, brother-in-law grew even more excessive. After finding out that big sister was captured, he did not immediately set out to save her. Rather, he wanted to return to the clan and request your appearance.”</p>
 <p>“However, there is still quite a far distance between here and our clan’s headquarters. We were all afraid that we would not be able to make it in time.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, big brother Chu Feng said that he would go and save big sister.”</p>
 <p>“However, not only was brother-in-law against it, he also declared big brother Chu Feng to be a spy and attacked big brother Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Big brother Chu Feng was forced without any other option, and ended up injuring brother-in-law. However, big brother Chu Feng was truly lenient already.”</p>
 <p>“Else, with the strength that big brother Chu Feng possesses, even Yao Liutian was beheaded by him. As such, how could brother-in-law only suffer a bruise?” Zhan Lingtong explained. He was looking at his brother-in-law with a gaze filled with disdain.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it might be because he knew his brother-in-law very well, but Zhan Lingtong had managed to guess that his brother-in-law must’ve already twisted the truth. That was why he was trying to tell the truth for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Zhan Lingtong said, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression turned very ugly. Zhan Quezhi was his son-in-law, and he had treated him very well.</p>
 <p>However, never did he expect that Zhan Quezhi would be such a coward at a crucial moment. At that moment, he was extremely disappointed with Zhan Quezhi.</p>
 <p>Zhan Quezhi was able to discern that the situation was amiss from the expression on the Clan Chief’s face. Thus, he summoned up his courage and said, “Lingtong, even if I refused to allow you to bring Yue’er into the clan, there shouldn’t be a need for you to slander me like this, no?”</p>
 <p>“Lil’ Ling is my wife. After finding out that she was captured, I was more worried than anyone else. How could I do something like what you have said?”</p>
 <p>After refuting what Zhan Lingtong said, Zhan Quezhi revealed a very wronged expression as he looked to their Clan Chief and his wife, “Lord Clan Chief, please do not believe what Lingtong said. Lil’ Ling, you must not believe his lies.”</p>
 <p>“Father, big sister, all the things I have said are true. If you do not trust me, you can ask him,” Zhan Lingtong pointed to their clansman that had returned with injuries and then brought Chu Feng to rescue Zhan Lingling.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Zhan Lingtong was trying to have a witness testify against him, Zhan Quezhi hurriedly signaled with his eyes while also secretly sending a voice transmission to threaten that man to not tell the truth.</p>
 <p>In that sort of situation, that War Clansman also revealed a very difficult expression. After all, Zhan Quezhi’s status was no small matter. In the Ancient Era’s War Clan, people like himself who lacked status did not dare to offend Zhan Quezhi.</p>
 <p>“Exactly what happened? Speak immediately,” The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief urged that clansman.</p>
 <p>“Putt~~~”</p>
 <p>After a moment of hesitation, that War Clan’s Clansman actually knelt in midair.</p>
 <p>He declared, “Lord Clan Chief, Lady Ling, this matter is extremely important. As such, this lowly one does not dare to lie. However, the truth is as Young Master Lingtong said.”</p>
 <p>“You… even you dare to frame me?! Exactly what sort of benefits did that Chu Feng give you?!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Zhan Quezhi was immediately furious. He pulled out his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and wanted to attack that man.</p>
 <p>“Zhan Quezhi, you damned bastard!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief was also furious. He cast his eyes burning with rage at Zhan Quezhi.</p>
 <p>It was not only their Clan Chief, even Zhan Lingling cast the same sort of rage-filled gaze at Zhan Quezhi.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Zhan Quezhi stood stunned. He had no idea what to do.</p>
 <p>“Paa~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a sharp echo was heard. The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief had actually unleashed a slap onto Zhan Quezhi’s face from afar.</p>
 <p>“Wuuahh~~~”</p>
 <p>A scream was heard, and Zhan Quezhi started to, like a kite with its string cut, spin around in the sky nonstop. He was actually slapped tens of thousands of meters away.</p>
 <p>However, immediately after he stabilized himself, Zhan Quezhi flew right back and knelt in midair.</p>
 <p>At that moment, blood covered his face. Half of his face had been deformed by the slap. Furthermore, his aura was very weak.</p>
 <p>Not only had Zhan Quezhi received external injuries, he had also received internal injuries. From this, it could be seen that even though the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief was lenient, his attack was still quite strong.</p>
 <p>However, Zhan Quezhi did not dare to utter the slightest bit of complaint. Rather, while shedding tears, he lamented, “Lord Clan Chief, I was indeed in the wrong back then. However, my considerations were not mistaken either.”</p>
 <p>“You know very well how strong we are. We would not have been a match for that Yao Liutian. Even if we were to go try to save Lil’ Ling, we would only have been throwing our lives away.”</p>
 <p>“Not only that, we would also have delayed the rescue. At that time, finding you was indeed the most rational decision.”</p>
 <p>“As for me declaring that Chu Feng to be the Monstrous Clan’s spy, it was totally a misunderstanding.”</p>
 <p>“Please think about it, he is an unfamiliar person. Yet, he wanted to bring with him the only person who knew where Lil’ Ling was with talk about saving her. How could I not suspect him?”</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, although I was wrong, I was actually not mistaken in my judgment.”</p>
 <p>After Zhan Quezhi said those words, Zhan Lingling’s gaze was moved slightly. The anger in her eyes had lessened by a lot.</p>
 <p>After all, what Zhan Quezhi said was indeed reasonable.</p>
 <p>However, the anger of the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief did not decrease.</p>
 <p>He pointed at Zhan Quezhi and said, “I am not blaming you because you did not rush to save Ling’er immediately.”</p>
 <p>“Rather, it is because you tried to invert right and wrong, tried to twist the truth and slander another. This means that your moral quality is bad.”</p>
 <p>“From today on, you are to be removed from all your posts. Go and properly reflect upon your mistakes. Furthermore, immediately apologize to Chu Feng for me. Remember this, if it wasn’t for him today, it was very possible that your wife would’ve already met with an unfortunate encounter.”</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief spoke in a very furious manner.</p>
 <p>“Lil’ Ling, I…” Zhan Quezhi looked to Zhan Lingling. He wanted his wife to plead for him.</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking at me? Are you not supposed to apologize to Chu Feng?” Zhan Lingling said with an angry expression on her face.</p>
 <p>Zhan Quezhi’s expression turned dejected. He had never expected that his affectionate wife who would help him out even if he was to have made mistakes would actually helping an outsider at that moment.</p>
 <p>Although he was feeling extremely unreconciled, Zhan Quezhi did not dare to go against the orders from the Clan Chief. Thus, in an insincere manner, he apologized to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Then, at Chu Feng’s request, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief agreed to take Yue’er and the other commoners into their Ancient Era’s War Clan’s final territory.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, for the sake of welcoming Chu Feng and thanking him for saving his daughter, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief ordered a banquet to be held.</p>
 <p>However, as they were in times of war and the morale of the Ancient Era’s War Clan was low from the constant retreats, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief did not make the banquet too extravagant.</p>
 <p>Other than culinary delicacies and fine wines, he did not prepare any singing or dancing. That said, he ordered all of the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s management elders over.</p>
 <p>At the banquet, the management elders started to size Chu Feng up nonstop. It was as if Chu Feng was simply not a human at all.</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Feng was from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>To them, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was an extremely remarkable place.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they had heard of the news of Chu Feng killing Yao Liutian. Adding on the fact that Chu Feng was this young, they started to have a whole new level of respect toward Chu Feng and did not dare to show any negligence.</p>
 <p>Even for the elders that had lived for over ten thousand years, they would still be extremely respectful when speaking with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, not only have you saved my son, you’ve also saved my daughter. I truly do not know how I am supposed to repay you for this kindness.”</p>
 <p>“How about this: if there’s anything you want, as long as our Ancient Era’s War Clan is capable of giving it to you, I will agree to anything,” The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, are you serious about that?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“As long as we have it, I will agree to anything,” The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief said in a frank and straightforward manner.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Young Hero Chu Feng, please don’t hold back. If you have anything you want, go ahead and tell us.”</p>
 <p>The elders, as well as Zhan Lingtong’s elder brothers and sisters, all echoed what the Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>To them, Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling were the two individuals with the purest bloodline in their Ancient Era’s War Clan. To the Ancient Era’s War Clan, Chu Feng’s rescue of them was an enormous favor.</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case, I will speak my mind,” For the sake of showing his sincerity, Chu Feng stood up.</p>
 <p>After he ran his gaze over the crowd, he said, “I, Chu Feng, have always admired senior Zhan Haichuan. Thus, for me to be able to be fortunate enough to arrive at the Ancient Era’s War Clan today, I have a presumptuous request.”</p>
 <p>“I wish to go and visit the place where senior Zhan Haichuan trained. If possible, I wish to be able to train there for some time.”</p>
 <p>Using this opportunity, Chu Feng told them what he wanted the most. That was, he wanted to train at the place where Zhan Haichuan comprehended his way of martial cultivation.</p>
 <p>However, after Chu Feng finished saying those words, there was no reply. In addition to that, Chu Feng saw that everyone present had difficult expressions on their faces.</p>
