 <p><strong> Chapter 2081 - Succession Ceremony</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Zhen!!!” Turning his head, Chu Feng discovered a familiar face among the group of people from the Azure Dragon School. That person was Chu Zhen.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s you?!!” Upon seeing Chu Feng, Chu Zhen’s body trembled. Then, he revealed an overjoyed expression, and quickly walked toward Chu Feng to carefully inspect him from head to to toe.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, it’s really you! When did you return?! How have you been all these years?!” Chu Zhen was exceptionally happy and excited upon seeing Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I’ve just returned. I decided to pay my respects to grandfather and the others first,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he asked, “Why would you be here?”</p>
 <p>“This place is, after all, our Chu Family’s cemetery. Although there are people from the Azure Dragon School guarding this place, we are still worried about it. Thus, the remaining brothers and sisters of our Chu Family take turns guarding this place. I happened to be the one guarding here this month,” Chu Zhen said with a light smile.</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Zhen, this person… could he be?” At that moment, the others from the Azure Dragon School all walked over curiously. They used gazes filled with reverence and a slight bit of timidity to look at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“This person is our Azure Dragon School’s world-shaking and all-powerful Chu Feng. Why are you all still standing there? Quickly, pay your respects,” Chu Zhen said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“We pay our respects to Lord Chu Feng,” After verifying Chu Feng’s identity, the others from the Azure Dragon School uniformly half-kneeled before Chu Feng to courteously greet him.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s fame was truly too enormous. His fame was not just limited to the Azure Province, but was now known throughout the entire Nine Provinces Continent and the entire Eastern Sea Region.</p>
 <p>The name Chu Feng had long since become a legend in the Eastern Sea Region. Thus, even though a lot of people had never met Chu Feng before, they all felt deep admiration and adoration for Chu Feng. Chu Feng could be said to be the idol of countless people.</p>
 <p>“Quickly, get up,” Chu Feng lightly waved his hand, and those people were all brought back up. Then, with a wave of Chu Feng’s sleeve, many Martial Beads landed in those people’s hands.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Lord Chu Feng, what are these?! They actually contain such a dense amount of Natural Energy?!”</p>
 <p>Once the Martial Beads landed in their hands, the eyes of those people immediately started to shine. They could be considered to be people with decent levels of martial cultivation in the Azure Dragon School, all in the Profound Realm. Thus, they could be said to be experienced individuals that had seen many cultivation treasures. However, they had never seen pearls like the ones in their hands.</p>
 <p>“Those are called Martial Beads. Consider them my greeting gift,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Lord Chu Feng. Thank you, Lord Chu Feng!!!”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, those Azure Dragon School’s disciples once again began to express their thanks toward Chu Feng by bowing to him. Merely by looking at those Martial Beads, they knew that they were extremely valuable items. Yet, Chu Feng had actually given them a hundred Martial Beads each. As such, how could they not be excited? They truly felt that they would become extremely rich just by having those Martial Beads.</p>
 <p>“Little brother Chu Feng, you’ve truly become more and more heroic. Those are some extremely precious treasures to be used as greeting gifts,” Chu Zhen said. There was a trace of jealousy in his words. It was as if he was saying that since Chu Feng had given that many precious Martial Beads to outsiders, he should give him some too.</p>
 <p>“Chu Zhen, I’ve already prepared your gift,” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a Cosmos Sack and placed it in Chu Zhen’s hand.</p>
 <p>Chu Zhen received the Cosmos Sack and opened it. Immediately, his expression changed enormously. He was overjoyed, and felt as if he was dreaming.</p>
 <p>Merely counting the Martial Beads, that Cosmos Sack contained hundreds of thousands. In addition to the Martial Beads, there were also other treasures. They were all treasures that he had never seen before.</p>
 <p>“Little brother Chu Feng, you are truly more and more amazing. You’re actually gifting things this precious so casually. Truly, the gap between you and us is growing greater and greater,” Chu Zhen carefully put the Cosmos Sack away and looked at Chu Feng with an expression filled with admiration.</p>
 <p>Back then, he and Chu Feng had both been disciples of the Azure Dragon School. At that time, he had looked down upon Chu Feng and bullied him.</p>
 <p>Yet now, the disparity between the two of them was truly as enormous as the heavens from the earth. Even though it had been many years, Chu Zhen always felt ashamed upon remembering what what he had done back then.</p>
 <p>“We’re brothers of the same family, you don’t have to distance yourself,” Chu Feng said with a light smile. Then, he asked, “How is the Azure Dragon School doing?”</p>
 <p>“Now that you mention it, there will be a grand happy occasion that will happen in the Azure Dragon School today,” Chu Zhen said happily.</p>
 <p>“Happy occasion? What might that be?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“The succession of the new headmaster. Guess who the new headmaster will be?” Chu Zhen said.</p>
 <p>“Who is it? Tell me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Haha, it’s your big brother Chu Guyu,” Chu Zhen said.</p>
 <p>“My big brother?!” Chu Feng was also overjoyed upon hearing such news.</p>
 <p>Chu Guyu was originally a disciple of the Qing Province’s Lingyun School. Later on, due to many unforeseen events, he ended up joining the Azure Dragon School.</p>
 <p>Chu Guyu had possessed a very decent talent to begin with. Furthermore, Chu Feng had also provided Chu Guyu with a lot of cultivation resources, and the Azure Dragon School had also focused on the cultivation of the people from the Chu Family because of Chu Feng. Chu Guyu’s current cultivation was extremely exceptional in the Nine Provinces Continent. Thus, it did not come as a surprise for Chu Feng that he would be the next headmaster.</p>
 <p>Merely, Chu Feng had actually managed to return right on the day when his big brother was to succeed as the new headmaster. It was truly fortunate for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I’ll go and congratulate my big brother,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little brother Chu Feng, while it’s good that you want to congratulate him, I fear that the Succession Ceremony would’ve ended by the time we reach the Azure Dragon School. After all… it is already in the noon hours now,” Chu Zhen said with regret after looking to the sky.</p>
 <p>“That might not necessarily be the case,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he grabbed Chu Zhen and soared into the sky. He began to fly toward the direction of the Azure Dragon School.</p>
 <p>The current Azure Dragon School was filled with excitement. Not only had all of the schools and sects from the Azure Province come to visit and congratulate them, even the Jiang Royal Clan’s ancestor and the Ten Thousand Monstrous Mountain’s Monstrous Monkey King arrived to offer their congratulations.</p>
 <p>It could be said… that all of the grand characters in the Nine Provinces Continent had gathered at the Azure Dragon School.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the person sitting in the headmaster’s seat was no longer the previous headmaster, nor was it the Azure Dragon Founder. Instead, it was a handsome man. That person was none other than Chu Feng’s big brother, Chu Guyu.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Chu, this is our Void School’s congratulatory gift. Please accept our kind regards.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, all the schools and sects were offering their congratulatory gifts. Regardless of who it was, the Azure Dragon School would accept all of their congratulatory gifts. Not only that, they would also present gifts to the people that gave them gifts. Furthermore, the gifts which they would give out would oftentimes be much more precious than the gifts they received.</p>
 <p>After all, with the resources provided by Chu Feng, the current Azure Dragon School was extremely rich. It had become the fully deserving overlord of the Nine Provinces Continent. The previous overlord of the Nine Provinces Continent, the Jiang Royal Dynasty, also paled into insignificance by comparison.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Chu, this is my congratulatory gift. Please accept my kind regards.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a sweet-looking woman walked over to Chu Guyu and gifted him an ugly-looking straw hat.</p>
 <p>If anyone else dared to do something like that, they would definitely be dragged away on the spot and then killed. The reason for that was because it was most definitely a show of disrespect toward the new headmaster.</p>
 <p>However, when it was done by that woman, no one said anything. Instead, they all started to laugh.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that woman was Chu Feng’s older cousin, Chu Yue.</p>
