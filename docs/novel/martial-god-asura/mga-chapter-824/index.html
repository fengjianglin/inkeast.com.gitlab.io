 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 824 - Shelter</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, who sent you that message? The Crippling Night Demon Sect?” The smart Zi Ling had a clue what Chu Feng was thinking when he asked those questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm. It’s Senior Earth King from the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He sent me a message and said he wants to meet me, that there’s something he needs to discuss.” Chu Feng did not trick Zi Ling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you should quickly go find them. No need to worry about us. In the past month, my father and mother had carefully laid Concealment Spirit Formations, so it’s fine if we hide here,” said Zi Ling, knowing that Chu Feng had business in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it is not safe here. Don’t underestimate the Immortal Execution Archipelago; they possess many techniques. Even with my Spirit Formation techniques, I was unable to escape their search. If they send experts here, they will definitely be able to find you.” Chu Feng quickly shook his head. He had saved Zi Ling after so much difficulty, so he didn’t want Zi Ling to enter the tiger’s mouth again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, right now, the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Immortal Execution Archipelago are like water and fire. In order to deal with the Crippling Night Demon Sect, the Immortal Execution Archipelago even used important lands as the price to ally with the Three Great Monstrous Clans so they can deal with the Crippling Night Demon Sect all together</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, although quite a few Crippling Night Demon Sect experts have shown themselves, if the Three Great Monstrous Clans truly allies with the Immortal Execution Archipelago, then it won’t be good. Since they’re looking for you with such haste, they must have important matters to discuss. You cannot put this off,” Zi Ling said very seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Zi Ling who acted in such a way, Chu Feng’s heart couldn’t help warming. She was truly thoughtful. Not only for him, but also for the global situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, there is only one definite safe place, and that’s the Misty Peak. I’ll first send you there, then go the Four Seas Academy,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Four Seas Academy? Su Rou, Su Mei, and the others are still in the Four Seas Academy?” Zi Ling asked worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, but you don’t need to worry. Even if the Immortal Execution Archipelago knows I’m called Chu Feng, they shouldn’t be that quick to find that they are related to me. After all, the world is so big and there are so many famous people. It would require large amounts of time in investigation to find the ones connected to me,” Chu Feng calmly said. He had already prepared for that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… that Earth King from the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Doesn’t he have something he needs you for?” Zi Ling was still a bit worried, afraid she would interfere in Chu Feng’s important matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t tell me the specifics, and just told me to find a place to meet him. Right now, I’ll tell him to find me at the Four Seas Academy. After sending you to the Misty Peak, I’ll go there and meet up with him,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then fine.” Zi Ling didn’t try to convince Chu Feng anymore when he insisted like that. Instead, she listened to his arrangements because she knew very well if they were not arranged in a safe place, even if Chu Feng met up with the experts from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, he would not be able to fight with no worries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, on that very day, Chu Feng led Zi Ling and the others away from the mountain range. He found a Teleportation Array that wasn’t guarded by the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Through it, they were able to be directly sent to the Misty Peak. Even if the Immortal Execution Archipelago felt Chu Feng and the others would possibly head towards the Misty Peak, they could not stop them unless they truly decided to anger Lady Piaomiao, the old monster who had lived for a thousand years. They would definitely not dare come to the Misty Peak since they had also angered the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Feng and the others walked away from the Teleportation Array and saw the familiar sceneries, he could finally somewhat relax his tense heart because he knew they had successfully arrived within the territory of Lady Piaomiao. Within that zone, there was no one who would harm them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing he was worried about was whether the Misty Peak would accept Zi Ling and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Chu Feng!” Just at that moment, a familiar voice suddenly rang out. At the same time, a familiar person flew over from nearby—it was Chun Wu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Chu Feng, you’ve finally come!” After seeing Chu Feng, Chun Wu was very happy. Then, she looked at Zi Xuanyuan and the others, and in the end, her eyes landed on Zi Ling’s body. She said in amazement, “Waa, this is Murong Xun’s fiancée? She’s even more beautiful than my Senior Qiuzhu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Chun Wu, this is Zi Ling. However, she is not Murong Xun’s fiancée, but mine,” Chu Feng corrected with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Chun Wu, how are you? When we were coming here, Chu Feng mentioned you and said you helped him greatly.” As for Zi Ling, she wasn’t angry because of Chun Wu’s mistake and instead, very respectfully bowed to her. She was very grateful to those who helped Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Ehh, doesn’t that mean you’re my sister-in-law? Heh, hello sister-in-law!<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>” Chun Wu knew she made a mistake so her smile was very sincere.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Chun Wu, it seemed that you were waiting here for us?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! Master knew you’ve stirred up a huge mess, and it’s even said you took away quite a few people from the Zi family. You yourself are fine, but it’s likely inconvenient for you to have people by your side. So, she told me to wait here, and if you came, to bring you up. The Misty Peak has already opened its gates, welcoming your arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just didn’t think I would have to wait this long. I even thought you wouldn’t come! But, luckily, you still did. This at least means nothing happened to you. Hehe…” Chun Wu’s smile was very comfortable. It could be seen that she truly worried for Chu Feng’s safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So Lady Piaomiao already expected me to return.” Chu Feng was ecstatic when he heard those words. Originally, he even worried she wouldn’t accept them, but now, he could finally be at ease completely. As he felt grateful, he said to Chun Wu, “Senior Chun Wu, I’m truly sorry you had to wait here so long for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Chu Feng, please don’t say that. Back then, in the Depraved Ravine, if it wasn’t to save me, you wouldn’t have killed Zhan Feng, and you wouldn’t have had this grudge with the Immortal Execution Archipelago,” Chun Wu said shamefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before I even met the Immortal Execution Archipelago, there was already enmity between us. The present situation was already fated to occur, and it was unrelated to you in any way.” Chu Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard those words, Chun Wu couldn’t help looking at Zi Ling. Then, as if she understood something, she didn’t say anything more. Lightly smiling, she said, “Follow me. Senior Qiushui is also here. They will definitely be very happy when they see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, Chu Feng and the Zi family followed Chun Wu to the Misty Peak. Seemingly already prepared, after coming up the peak, Chun Wu brought Chu Feng and the others to a palace, and after entering, Chun Wu had Chu Feng and Zi Ling wait there, while Zi Xuanyuan, Zi Ling’s parents, and the others were brought to elsewhere. From what Chun Wu said, she was arranging them into their residences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, you truly are a troublemaker!” Shortly after Chun Wu left, Qiushui Fuyan’s voice rang out within the palace. Casting his gaze over, not only was she there, even the unfathomable Lady Piaomiao was slowly walking towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were two super-experts, when Chu Feng saw them again, he not only lacked any nervousness, there was even a hint of an intimate feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After making such a huge mess, those who were willing to accept him—if they were not ones harboring malicious intents—were people who would show him great kindness. Obviously, these two were the latter.</span></p>
