 <p><strong> Chapter 1994 - Physical Bodies Seized</strong></p>
 <p>“Wuuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies shivered. Simultaneously, the two of them let out a light groan.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that, both Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal revealed worried expressions, and hurriedly stepped forward to check on Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>After carefully inspecting Su Rou and Su Mei, and discovering that both of them were fine, Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, “Senior, where is Zi Ling right now?”</p>
 <p>Su Rou and Su Mei were still unconscious. Thus, even though Chu Feng was not very worried, he was still worried. However, apart from the two of them, Chu Feng was also equally concerned about Zi Ling.</p>
 <p>Actually, compared to Su Rou and Su Mei, Chu Feng’s feelings for Zi Ling were actually a bit deeper. After all, Chu Feng and Zi Ling had experienced more things together.</p>
 <p>Merely, after leaving the Nine Provinces Continent, due to various reasons, Chu Feng had not accompanied Zi Ling for much time. As such, his guilt toward Zi Ling became even deeper.</p>
 <p>“Zi Ling was taken away by that great sir. Beside him, Zi Ling should be absolutely safe. Thus, Chu Feng, you do not have to worry about Zi Ling,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Taken away?” Chu Feng was startled. He asked, “Why was she taken away?”</p>
 <p>“He didn’t say. He only said that it was a good thing,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said. Seemingly worried that Chu Feng would be worried, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal added, “Rest assured, the way I see it, that great sir’s strength is not inferior to the Elf King and the Heaven Reaching Immortal. Thus, it is very safe for Zi Ling to be with him. You do not have to worry about her.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng was startled.</p>
 <p>The Elf King was an extremely powerful individual. Chu Feng had felt that he should be the fully-deserving number one expert in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>Yet now, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had actually compared that senior, as well as the number one Immortal of the Ten Immortals, the Heaven Reaching Immortal, to the Elf King.</p>
 <p>Could it be that the Holy Land of Martialism really did possess existences on par with the Elf King? In other words, they were peak Martial Emperors, existences infinitely close to Half Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Elf King is not the only peak Martial Emperor in the Holy Land of Martialism?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>During the time when he was with Xian Miaomiao, he came to know the Elf King’s cultivation. He was a rank nine Martial Emperor, a peak Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>If that Heaven Reaching Immortal and that mysterious blind old man possessed the same cultivation as the Elf King, it would mean that they were also rank nine Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“As far as I know, the Heaven Reaching Immortal is indeed a peak Martial Emperor. As for that great sir, truth be told, I do not know what his cultivation is,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, senior, you also do not know much about that senior?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, I have been acquainted with him for a long time. However, I do not know much about him. In fact, I do not even know his name,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal shook his head with a wry smile.</p>
 <p>“That senior is truly mysterious. However, never would I have expected the Heaven Reaching Immortal to also be that powerful, to have strength that is actually on par with the Elf King.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was shocked by the Heaven Reaching Immortal’s cultivation. Originally, he had thought that the Heaven Reaching Immortal was a rank eight Martial Emperor like the World Devastator Immortal. To his surprise, the Heaven Reaching Immortal was actually a peak Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“The Heaven Reaching Immortal has been a renowned expert since the time of Emperor Qing. Merely, he is not someone who fights for fame and personal profit. As for his strength, he is extremely powerful,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, how is the character of the Heaven Reaching Immortal? Would he end up joining the Dark Hall too?” Chu Feng asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>The strength which the Dark Hall had revealed right now was truly too frightening. They already possessed many experts who had joined them. As such, Chu Feng was truly afraid that the Heaven Reaching Immortal would also join the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>After all, hearing what the Weaponry Refinement Immortal said, the Heaven Reaching Immortal should be over ten thousand years old. As a human, living for that long was already inconceivable. Likely, he was near the limit of his lifespan.</p>
 <p>As the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was from the Outer World, he knew a lot of things that the people in the Holy Land of Martialism did not. Thus, if he were to declare that he possessed a method to extend one’s lifespan, the Heaven Reaching Immortal might also end up serving the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>“Regarding that, you can rest assured. The Heaven Reaching Immortal will not serve anyone,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said with certainty.</p>
 <p>“That would be best,” Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt a lot more relieved.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the unconscious Su Rou and Su Mei suddenly opened their eyes and stood up.</p>
 <p>“Lil Rou, Lil Mei, you’ve woken up?” Seeing that his lovers had regained consciousness, Chu Feng was overjoyed. He hurriedly walked toward them and hugged them.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, Chu Feng’s eyes suddenly shrank back. His expression took a huge change. Then, he abruptly pushed Su Rou and Su Mei aside. Then, with a stern voice, he shouted, “Who are you?”</p>
 <p>“Mn?” Seeing Chu Feng asking who Su Rou and Su Mei were, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was startled. He hurriedly walked over to them and discovered that it was truly Su Rou and Su Mei who stood beside Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Thus, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked Chu Feng in a very confused manner, “Chu Feng, what’s wrong? Aren’t they Lil Rou and Lil Mei?”</p>
 <p>“No, they’re not,” Chu Feng shook his head. Then, he shouted with a stern voice again, “Who exactly are you? Quickly, speak!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was panicking. Su Rou and Su Mei’s physical appearance remained the same. However, he was able to determine that something was wrong with them with a single glance. Even though he was clearly standing before Su Rou and Su Mei, he felt that they were incomparably distant from him.</p>
 <p>“You are called Chu Feng, right?” Suddenly, Su Rou and Su Mei uttered the same voice from their mouths at the same time. Not only were their sentences exactly the same, even their voices were exactly the same.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Hearing those words, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was deeply alarmed. He also realized that it was not the actual Su Rou and Su Mei before them.</p>
 <p>“Apologies. I will have to borrow your lovers’ bodies for a while,” Su Rou and Su Mei said.</p>
 <p>Right after the two of them said those words, they soared into the sky and turned into a gale that rapidly flew away.</p>
 <p>“Stop!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng started to thoroughly panic. He did not dare to hesitate, and immediately unleashed all of his strength to chase after Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>The Weaponry Refinement Immortal also chased after them.</p>
 <p>It was very clear that Su Rou and Su Mei’s physical bodies had been seized. It was uncertain whether their souls were still alive or dead.</p>
 <p>“Stop! Are you the Moon Immortal?!”</p>
 <p>“You have deceived me! You clearly said that you would bestow your powers to them. Yet, you decided to seize their bodies. I have trusted you in vain!” Chu Feng shouted with incomparable anger.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew that it should either be the Moon Immortal or the Moon Demon who had seized Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies. Furthermore, based on their reaction, it was very likely to be the Moon Immortal. The reason for that was because the voice that Su Rou and Su Mei had spoken with was exactly the same as the Moon Immortal’s voice Chu Feng had heard in his dreams.</p>
 <p>“You do not have to continue to chase after me. I said that I will only borrow their bodies for a while. The two of them are still alive. After I finish what I want to do, I will return them to you,” That person said.</p>
 <p>After leaving those words, that person began to accelerate. As Su Rou’s and Su Mei’s dresses fluttered in the wind, they disappeared from Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s line of sight. Their speed was simply speechlessly fast.</p>
 <p>“No, no, nooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>After Su Rou and Su Mei disappeared, Chu Feng started to roar frantically. Without slowing down in the slightest, he continued to chase after them. Unfortunately, no matter how frantically he chased after them, he was unable to catch sight of Su Rou and Su Mei’s silhouettes.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t chase anymore. Our opponent is too strong. They’re at the very least a peak Martial Emperor. We are not able to catch up to them,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal urged.</p>
 <p>“No, no, I cannot abandon Lil Rou and Lil Mei, I cannot!!!” Chu Feng did not slow down in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Soon, they flew out of the Moonlight Maze. However, he was still unable to catch sight of Su Rou and Su Mei. Chu Feng began to fly aimlessly. His eyes were blood red. He was simply on the verge of being driven mad.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal grabbed Chu Feng and forcibly stopped him. He said, “Chu Feng, calm yourself. This won’t do. You will not be able to catch up to them.”</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, the Moon Immortal should not have any malicious intentions in seizing Lil Rou and Lil Mei’s bodies. Else, with her strength, she would be totally capable of killing us. There would be no need for her to bother explaining her intentions to you,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal urged. Chu Feng's’ current state of mind was truly too much of a mess.</p>
 <p>In the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s impression, Chu Feng was someone that would not be scared, no matter how enormous the incoming wave was. Even if the heavens were to collapse, he would still be able to confront it with calmness.</p>
 <p>However, the current Chu Feng was not only panicking, he even appeared to be nearly driven mad. If this were to continue, he did not know what sort of thing Chu Feng would end up doing.</p>
