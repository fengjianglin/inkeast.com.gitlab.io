 <p><strong>Chapter 2750 - Chu Feng’s Opportunity</strong></p>
 <p>“Ranked third on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Song Yunfei. Song Yunfei is the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Son. As for the Starfall Holy Land, it is deemed to be the strongest power in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“The Dao Imperial Palace, Paradise Valley and Ghost Sect Hall are all inferior to the Starfall Holy Land.”</p>
 <p>“As for the second on the Demon-level Geniuses List, her name is Chu Ruoshi. She is also from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I should mention that Chu Ruoshi is a great beauty. I was fortunate to see her once. She is truly as beautiful as a celestial fairy. Thus, she is deemed to be the head beauty of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Three Great Beauties.”</p>
 <p>When Li Xiang mentioned this matter, his entire expression changed. He even started drooling. From his reaction, one could imagine how exceptionally beautiful that Chu Ruoshi was.</p>
 <p>“Wait a moment, you said that Chu Ruoshi is the head beauty of the Three Great Beauties. Then who are the other two?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had heard of Song Xi mentioning to him that Xia Yun’er was one of the Three Great Beauties.</p>
 <p>And now, this Li Xiang said that Chu Ruoshi was the head beauty of the Three Great Beauties.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng already knew of two of the Three Great Beauties. Because of that, Chu Feng was curious as to who the third beauty was.</p>
 <p>“Hehe,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Li Xiang opened his mouth and revealed a low and vile smile. He raised his eyebrows and said to Chu Feng, “I truly wasn’t able to tell that you were actually a major pervert.”</p>
 <p>“I got it now. You weren’t simply meddling in other people’s business to save that monstrous woman earlier. Instead, you wanted to fuck her, isn’t that right? That taste of yours is quite intense.”</p>
 <p>“Are you going to tell me or not?” Chu Feng narrowed his eyebrows slightly and asked in an annoyed manner.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s attitude was very aggressive. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was able to tell that this fellow by the name of Li Xiang was someone very fond of showing off.</p>
 <p>Even though he was displaying an appearance of reluctance to tell Chu Feng about it, Chu Feng knew that he actually wanted to tell him everything to show how knowledgeable he was.</p>
 <p>“Boy, watch your attitude. How could you act this arrogantly when asking another? You should be grateful that your daddy is not charging you for telling you this important information. Yet, you dare to actually get aggressive with me?” Li Xiang spoke in a very displeased manner.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t want to tell, then forget about it,” Chu Feng left those words and then planned to leave.</p>
 <p>“Wait,” Sure enough, Li Xiang immediately moved before Chu Feng to stop him.</p>
 <p>With a very helpless expression on his face, Li Xiang said, “Forget about it, forget about it. I am one who will carry things through. Since I’ve already told you all that, I might as well tell you everything.”</p>
 <p>“The Three Great Beauties are headed by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Ruoshi. As for the other two beauties, they are Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun’er.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve already explained who Chu Lingxi is to you. She is that girl ranked ninth on the Demon-level Geniuses List. As for that Xia Yun’er, although she is not on the Demon-level Geniuses List, her background is very powerful too. She is the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, that Xia Yun’er has been in closed-door training the entire time. It was only a year ago that she revealed herself to the people of the world. Furthermore, Xia Yun’er is very young. She is younger than even Chu Lingxi. Furthermore, since she is deemed to be the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, her talent for martial cultivation is most definitely very outstanding.”</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, Xia Yun’er will one day demonstrate her extraordinary talent on the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition and leave her name on the Demon-level Geniuses List,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Then who’s ranked first on the Demon-level Geniuses List?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Naturally, the person ranked first on the Demon-level Geniuses List would be from the Chu Heavenly Clan. His name is Chu Qing.”</p>
 <p>“That Chu Qing has already held first place five times in a row. He is the publicly accepted number one genius of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm right now. Before him, both Chu Ruoshi and Song Yun’er would not be able to withstand a single blow.”</p>
 <p>“However, Chu Qing’s age is quite old. Not long from now, he will be over a hundred years old. At that time, he will no longer be considered a member of the younger generation within a hundred years of age. He will also not be able to participate in the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition will be even more intense. Without Chu Qing participating anymore, Chu Ruoshi and Song Yunfei will likely both want to seize first place,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Since the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition happens once every three years, when will the next one be held?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Roughly a bit over a year from now,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you know what the cultivations of Chu Ruoshi and Song Yunfei are right now?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“The two of them were both rank seven True Immortals during the last Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.”</p>
 <p>“As for their current cultivation, it would be hard to say. After all, they have not shown themselves in a very long time,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Thanks,” Chu Feng clasped his fist at Li Xiang. The reason he expressed his thanks was because Li Xiang had told him some very important information. Even though he still did not like him, Chu Feng must still express his thanks.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Chu Feng turned around and began to proceed toward the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, that Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition will be an opportunity for you,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>She knew very well what Chu Feng needed to do after coming to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. It wasn’t to extinguish the Chu Heavenly Clan and avenge his father.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s father had told him before that even though the Chu Heavenly Clan was unrighteous toward them, they could not be unjust toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>After all, flowing in their veins was the blood of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Ultimately, their roots were still with the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng’s purpose in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was to obtain the Chu Heavenly Clan’s acknowledgement. Only by obtaining the Chu Heavenly Clan’s acknowledgement would they let his father out and restore their names.</p>
 <p>Of course, the restoration of their names was not Chu Feng’s purpose. After all, he didn’t care about it.</p>
 <p>What Chu Feng wanted was to find out information regarding his mother.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s father had told him that as long as the Chu Heavenly Clan acknowledged him and personally released his father, he would tell him about his mother.</p>
 <p>As for the method to make the Chu Heavenly Clan acknowledge him, it would naturally be revealing his strength.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng wanted to reveal his strength, then the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition would be the best opportunity.</p>
 <p>That Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition was the battlefield for the strongest members of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s younger generation. It was a place for members of the younger generation to compete against one another and prove themselves.</p>
 <p>And now, the several most powerful ranks on the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition were practically all occupied by the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. Furthermore, they even held both first and second place.</p>
 <p>This was sufficient to show that the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were truly very powerful. The Chu Heavenly Clan was truly worthy of their status as the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>Who was Chu Feng? He was someone deemed to be trash and incapable of learning martial cultivation, a discarded child driven out of the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>However, if Chu Feng was able to defeat all of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition, then… everyone would know that the talent test that the Chu Heavenly Clan had conducted on him was wrong.</p>
 <p>He would have everyone know that he, Chu Feng, was not trash. Perhaps at that time, the Chu Heavenly Clan would acknowledge him.</p>
 <p>That was the reason why Her Lady Queen said that the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition would be a great opportunity for Chu Feng.</p>
