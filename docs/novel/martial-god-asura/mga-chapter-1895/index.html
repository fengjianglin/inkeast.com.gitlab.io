 <p><strong> Chapter 1895 - Extraordinary Significance</strong></p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, what did you just say?” One of the Protectors asked in a very amazed manner.</p>
 <p>At that moment, practically all of the Ancient Era’s Elves present were looking to Xian Miaomiao with astonished expressions. This was especially true for Xian Yuyin and his father. At that moment, their expressions were truly marvelous.</p>
 <p>“I said I do not plan to enter the Blood Devouring Killing Formation with Xian Yuyin,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Are you to say that you’re planning to enter by yourself?” That Protector asked again.</p>
 <p>“No, I’m going to have Chu Feng accompany me,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“What?” Hearing those words, not to mention the Ancient Era’s Elves, even the Immeasurable Immortal and the Avaricious Immortal were shocked.</p>
 <p>As for Xian Yuyin and his father, they were so stunned that it was as if they had become petrified. Especially Xian Yuyin, he simply did not even dare to believe what he had just heard.</p>
 <p>“Xian Miaomiao, what sort of joke is this? Chu Feng is a human. How could he possibly accompany you into the Blood Devouring Killing Formation?!” Xian Yuyin shouted. At that moment, he was extremely enraged, because he felt that his honor had been trampled upon.</p>
 <p>“Heh, it is up to me to determine who shall accompany me. What makes you think you can decide?” Xian Miaomiao cast a side eye at Xian Yuyin. She simply did not place him in her eyes at all.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, this matter is extremely important. How could you have a human like Chu Feng accompany you?” Xian Yuyin’s father added.</p>
 <p>“I said, it is up to me to decide who shall accompany me. None of you have a say in this matter,” Faced with Xian Yuyin and his father, Xian Miaomiao was still as domineering as before.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, this…” Feeling helpless, Xian Yuyin turned his gaze to the Elf King. He wanted to have the Elf King contain his daughter.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, why do you want Chu Feng to accompany you?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>“Royal Father, compared to Xian Yuyin, I trust Chu Feng more,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“You…” Hearing those words, Xian Yuyin was so enraged that he nearly vomited blood. At that moment, he felt his vision become blurred, and his head dizzy. He was simply about to be angered to death.</p>
 <p>Humiliation. This was an absolute humiliation. If this had been done privately, it would not be much. However, Xian Miaomiao had actually said those words without any concern before all those seniors. As such, how could Xian Yuyin possibly face the crowd? This was simply placing him in an awkward situation.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, are you not being too excessive here?!” At that moment, Xiao Yuyin’s father also had an angry expression on his face. To have his own son be humiliated in such a manner, he would naturally also be angered.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a very skinny old man among the Four Grand Elders said, “Miaomiao, no matter what, Xian Yuyin is your older brother. As such, how could you say that about him? Moreover, the matter of entering the Blood Devouring Killing Formation is no small matter. For you to find a human to accompany you, we would also not feel reassured.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Elder, Royal Father, it is not that I, Xian Miaomiao, am stubborn. Merely, the matter of finding Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers is my own personal matter to begin with.”</p>
 <p>“I truly do not understand why I need you all to decide my own matters. In short… either Chu Feng accompanies me, or I will not go. You all can decide what to do,” Xian Miaomiao’s expression grew completely gloomy.</p>
 <p>“This!!!” At that moment, even the Four Grand Elders’ expressions became ugly. The reason for that was because Xian Miaomiao was simply not placing them in her eyes. Her behavior was truly unacceptable.</p>
 <p>However, Xian Miaomiao was their Elf Kingdom’s future’s hope. Even though they were extremely imposing characters, extremely arrogant and domineering, they were unable to reveal any of their might, arrogance or dominance before her.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Princess Lingyue suddenly said, “Royal Father, Lord Elders, Lord Protectors, although Miaomiao’s words might be somewhat excessive, I feel that her decision is correct.”</p>
 <p>“Lingyue, what do you mean by that?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>“Royal Father, while Chu Feng is a human, he is outstanding all around.”</p>
 <p>“There is no need to mention his battle power; it is extremely powerful. Although he is a rank nine Half Martial Emperor, he was able to kill the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief. I presume that even little brother Yuyin might not necessarily be able to accomplish such a thing, no?” As Princess Lingyue said those words, she took a glance at Xian Yuyin.</p>
 <p>“How do you know that I can’t accomplish that? The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief was merely a rank three Martial Emperor. If I wanted to kill him, I would naturally be able to kill him,” Xian Yuyin said in a very disapproving manner.</p>
 <p>“Heh… the current you is naturally capable of accomplishing that. However, what I’m talking about is when you were a rank nine Half Martial Emperor. Back when you were a rank nine Half Martial Emperor, you seemed to not even be able to defeat a rank one Martial Emperor. Thus, how could you possibly contend against a rank three Martial Emperor?” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“You!!!” Xian Yuyin was so enraged that his body started to tremble all over. However, he didn’t know how to counter what Princess Lingyue said, for it was true that he had been unable to even defeat a rank one Martial Emperor back when he was a rank nine Half Martial Emperor. As such, he had no way to disavow what was said.</p>
 <p>Princess Lingyue had drawn blood with a single prick. She had directly attacked Xian Yuyin’s sore spot.</p>
 <p>“Of course, in terms of battle power, my little sister Xian Miaomiao is likely even more powerful than Chu Feng. The reason why I mentioned Chu Feng’s battle power is merely to let everyone know that Chu Feng will not drag Miaomiao down in terms of battle power.”</p>
 <p>“That said, there’s another aspect to consider. That is, Chu Feng is a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, he is the only Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist among the Holy Land of Martialism’s younger generation.”</p>
 <p>“That is why I feel that if Chu Feng were to accompany Miaomiao, it would be better than having little brother Yuyin accompany Miaomiao,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Immeasurable Immortal asked, “Little friend Chu Feng, you’re really a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?”</p>
 <p>“Senior, Chu Feng is indeed a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,” As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve. “Roar,” a small golden dragon flew out from his sleeve.</p>
 <p>That golden dragon was formed with spirit power. Furthermore, the spirit power that was flowing through it was Dragon Mark spirit power. Chu Feng had released it to prove his status as a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>“Very well, truly a young hero. Little friend Chu Feng, you have truly broadened my horizons,” The Immeasurable Immortal began to publicly applaud Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the Elf Kingdom’s Elders and Protectors’ eyes also shone. They were all slightly swayed.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists were truly no small matter. At the very least, their Elf Kingdom did not possess a single one.</p>
 <p>As for a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist as young as Chu Feng, they were simply akin to divine beings. It was the first time that a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist as young as Chu Feng had appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>This signified that Chu Feng possessed talent that was truly remarkable. Even though the Elf Kingdom was a power high and above which had stood at the apex of the Holy Land of Martialism since the very beginning, they still hoped to be able to get along with powerful humans. As for Chu Feng… he was someone that possessed that potential.</p>
 <p>“What a joke. A mere human, no matter how strong, will not be able to surpass us Ancient Era’s Elves. Not to mention anything else, if he is able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, I will let him go,” Xian Yuyin’s father said.</p>
 <p>“Heh… if it’s the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, then I will have to disappoint you. Chu Feng is indeed capable of triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle in the Cyanwood Domain that was triggered back then was triggered by none other than Chu Feng,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“What? He was the one who did that?” Hearing those words, the expressions with which the Ancient Era’s Elves looked to Chu Feng became extremely marvelous.</p>
 <p>To trigger an Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was no small matter. This was especially true for a human triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. In the whole of history, only Qing Xuantian had managed to accomplish that.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed Chu Feng. I was present back then. I can bear witness to it,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“This…” At that moment, the expressions with which the Ancient Era’s Elves in the palace hall looked to Chu Feng became even more complicated.</p>
 <p>In fact, even the guards outside the palace were unable to contain themselves, and wanted to sneak a few peeks at Chu Feng. The reason for that was because a human triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was truly no small matter.</p>
 <p>Speaking from a certain standpoint, Chu Feng might even become an expert as strong as Qing Xuantian.</p>
 <p>As for Qing Xuantian, he was someone that possessed extraordinary significance to the Elf Kingdom.</p>
