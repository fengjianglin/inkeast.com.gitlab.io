 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1809 - Watching With Folded Arms</strong></p>
 <p>“What? Mere rank one Martial Emperors? What arrogance! Today, I shall let you know the gap between Martial Emperors and Half Martial Emperors!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing how arrogant Chu Feng’s behaviour was, other than the two Martial Emperors being pinned down by Hong Qiang, the remaining five Martial Emperors all began to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“What? You’re implying that rank one Martial Emperors are very extraordinary?”</p>
 <p>“In that case, come, try killing me,” With a thought from Chu Feng, water and fire appeared at the same time. Like protector gods, the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique appeared on either side of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they were both emitting the aura of rank one Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Quickly, look. What are those? They are actually capable of fighting Martial Emperors?”</p>
 <p>“That’s a secret skill. It’s the Water Immortal Profound Technique.”</p>
 <p>“If that water is the Water Immortal Profound Technique, then wouldn’t that mean that fire is the Fire Immortal Profound Technique?”</p>
 <p>“How could this be? Didn’t Chu Feng only obtain the Water Immortal Profound Technique? How come even the Fire Immortal Profound Technique is with him? Hasn’t the Fire Immortal Profound Technique been lost for many years?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Techniques had blocked the attacks aimed at Chu Feng by the five rank one Martial Emperors, the crowd were all extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>At this moment, even the elders from the Three Palaces began to narrow their eyes. Chu Feng possessed both the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique. This was no small matter.</p>
 <p>While others might not know about it, they knew very well how difficult it was for the Five Elements Secret Skills to be controlled by a single person simultaneously. While they would be fine with a single secret skill, if they were to have two secret skills in their bodies, the two secret skills would create an enormous pressure. The pressure was so strong that ordinary people were simply incapable of enduring it.</p>
 <p>However, it was evident that Chu Feng had managed to endure the pressure from the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to have such fluent control over them.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>“Crash~~~”</p>
 <p>Soon, the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique exploded. Even though their bodies were instantly restored, they were smashed apart again immediately afterward.</p>
 <p>“It’s no good. No matter what, secret skills are only secret skills. They are simply incapable of withstanding real Martial Emperors,” The crowd cried out in alarm.</p>
 <p>Even though both the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique emitted the aura of rank one Martial Emperors, they were unable to withstand the attacks from the five Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, did you really think that you would be saved because of your secret skills? Do you know our strength now? Martial Emperors are not existences that you can look down on.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, three of the rank one Martial Emperors had broken free from the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, and were charging toward Chu Feng to attack him.</p>
 <p>Those three rank one Martial Emperors all held Incomplete Imperial Armaments in their hands. Their might was extremely strong.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng did not dare to underestimate them. He took a step back and then revealed the Heavenly Immortal Sword to face them.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Immortal Sword?”</p>
 <p>“Is that the Heavenly Immortal Sword he snatched away from Ximen Feixue? It has actually already acknowledged Chu Feng as its master?” Upon seeing the Heavenly Immortal Sword, the crowd burst into an uproar.</p>
 <p>“Hand over the Heavenly Immortal Sword!” Upon seeing the Heavenly Immortal Sword, one of the three Martial Emperors that was charging to kill Chu Feng became extremely furious. It turned out that he was a person from the Ximen Imperial Clan.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” Chu Feng snorted coldly. He unleashed the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique and collided with the three Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Golden light radiated all over. Martial powers were wreaking havoc as the four people fought one another.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, and could contend against rank one Martial Emperors with his cultivation of rank nine Half Martial Emperor, it was still very strenuous for him to fight against three rank one Martial Emperors simultaneously.</p>
 <p>“As expected of Martial Emperors. It would appear that I have underestimated the power of Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng frowned slightly. After his battle against Leng Yue, Chu Feng had thought that he already possessed the strength to kill rank one Martial Emperors. However, it would appear that he had overestimated himself.</p>
 <p>No matter how strong Leng Yue was, she was still only a Half Martial Emperor. However, his current opponents were actual Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng and Leng Yue possessed the battle power to contend against rank one Martial Emperors, it would be very difficult for them to defeat rank one Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>As for why that was the case, Chu Feng also didn’t know. In short… the strength of Martial Emperors was stronger than his own. It was as if there was a thin yet unsurmountable string that separated Half Martial Emperors and Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>As long as Chu Feng remained a Half Martial Emperor, even if his battle power was already approaching that of a Martial Emperor, or even surpassed that of the Martial Emperor he was fighting against, he would never be able to surmount that string, never be able to defeat a Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>When all was said and done, Half Martial Emperors were inferior to Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng is amazing. He’s actually managing to fight against three Martial Emperors with the cultivation of a Half Martial Emperor.”</p>
 <p>“Humph, so what? He’s still being oppressed by those three Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>“That’s different. If it were any other ordinary peak Half Martial Emperor fighting against three Martial Emperors, they would not be able to last a single bout. Yet, Chu Feng, with his cultivation of a peak Half Martial Emperor, is able to contend against three rank one Martial Emperors. If it was you, could you do that?”</p>
 <p>“I… this…”</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng was being kept on the defensive, his strength was acknowledged by the crowd. After all, being able to contend against Martial Emperors with the cultivation of a peak Half Martial Emperor was something akin to legend since ancient times.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this time, this thing which was akin to legend was actually happening before the crowd’s eyes. As such, how could they not be astonished?</p>
 <p>“With Chu Feng’s strength, if he were to fight against Zhang Tianyi, it’s likely that even Zhang Tianyi would not be a match for him.”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, if this is to continue, Chu Feng will not be able to withstand them anymore. As a mere Half Martial Emperor, no matter how strong the martial power contained within his dantian is, it will not be able to surpass an actual Martial Emperor’s martial power.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, some of the older generation’s experts shook their heads and sighed regretfully. They did not wish for a genius like Chu Feng to die like this. However, they also did not dare to oppose the Four Great Imperial Clans. All they could do was look on helplessly as everything unfolded before them.</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>At this moment. Inside the fort, Zhang Tianyi was kneeling before Zhang Ming and begging, “Father, I beg you, please save Chu Feng. Your son is kowtowing to you.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Zhang Tianyi ruthlessly smashed his head into the ground. Due to the fact that the ground was composed of special materials, Zhang Tianyi smashing his head so ruthlessly soon caused his head to become bloodied.</p>
 <p>“Tianyi, it is not that your father is heartless. I too wish to save Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, I believe you know the reason why our Zhang Clan was exterminated. I want you to obtain the title of Overlord. While I cannot lower my head to anyone, I also cannot willingly make enemies.”</p>
 <p>“That child Chu Feng is destined to be extraordinary. As long as he’s extraordinary, there will definitely be people who want to kill him.”</p>
 <p>“If I am to act today, I will only make enemies of the Four Clans. However, what if the Three Palaces and the Ancient Era’s Elves also want to kill him in the future? Are we to become enemies with the Three Palaces and the Ancient Era’s Elves too?” Zhang Ming asked.</p>
 <p>“Fine. Your son will not trouble father. However, I absolutely cannot watch my brother dying without doing anything. Even if I am to die, I shall die with him,” Zhang Tianyi abruptly got up and prepared to leave.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right after Zhang Tianyi got up, he became incapable of moving or even saying anything. It was as if he had been petrified. Zhang Tianyi had been bound by his father.</p>
 <p>“Tianyi, even if you are to hate me now, you will one day understand the heart of your father,” After Zhang Ming said those words, he closed his eyes. He had already made the resolution to watch with folded arms.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the attacks from the three rank one Martial Emperors were growing fiercer and fiercer. In fact, they had even unleashed their Imperial Bloodlines and were using Earthen Taboo Martial Skills to frantically unleash fatal attacks at Chu Feng. They were truly determined to kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, it was still very difficult for them to kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, that Ximen Imperial Clan’s Martial Emperor actually tossed out a talisman paper. Once that talisman paper was tossed out, it immediately turned into a ferocious beast. That ferocious beast was exceptionally fierce.</p>
 <p>That was a treasure for slaughtering others. Although it could only be used once, its power was boundless.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, you’re a Martial Emperor, and yet you’re actually this shameless. You’re incapable of killing me yourself, and actually ended up using treasures,” Chu Feng dodged the ferocious beast and revealed an expression of contempt.</p>
 <p>“If you have more tricks up your sleeve, you can use them. I’m only afraid that you don’t,” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Martial Emperor sneered.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” Hearing those words, Chu Feng snorted.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng flipped his palm, and then a blue bow appeared in his hand. Once that bow appeared, a blue oppressive might that was visible to the naked eye swept forth. Not only did it cover the three rank one Martial Emperor’s Incomplete Imperial Armaments, it also forced the three rank one Martial Emperors to fall back from Chu Feng.</p>
