 <p><strong> Chapter 2077 - Truly Ridiculous</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you…”</p>
 <p>“I…”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Qiushui Fuyan started to panic. She did not expect for Chu Feng to already know about what was happening outside even though he had just returned from the Immortalization Road.</p>
 <p>However, that was not the important aspect. Most importantly, she discovered that Chu Feng was angry. She had known Chu Feng for so long, but had practically never seen him angry at his friends before. Thus, at that moment, she was startled.</p>
 <p>“Big sister Fuyan, I have merely left for several years. Are you all treating me as an outsider already?” Chu Feng asked sternly. He was truly angry.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew Qiushui Fuyan well. Thus, he naturally knew what Qiushui Fuyan planned to do. Actually, Qiushui Fuyan was thinking for his sake. She was afraid that he would be in danger. Thus, she did not wish to involve Chu Feng, and planned to deceive him and lead him away.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was still unable to contain his anger. The reason for that was because if he did not come out at the right time to discover the situation outside, he would’ve been deceived by Qiushui Fuyan. If he were truly to have left this place, then the people from the Misty Peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect would very likely be done for.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng was able to tell that the battle seemed to have just began, the outcome of the battle was already decided. Even with the Misty Peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect joining hands, they would still be no match for that bunch of monstrous beasts.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng didn’t do anything, the Misty Peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s joint army, those people that were extremely close to Chu Feng, would likely end up dying today.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s not like that. We were just worried about your safety and didn’t want you to…” Qiushui Fuyan hurriedly tried to explain.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to explain," However, before Qiushui Fuyan could finish her words, Chu Feng interrupted her. He said, “Big sister Fuyan, in my eyes, you are my relative. I will not truly blame you.”</p>
 <p>“However… I absolutely cannot allow that bunch of monstrous beasts to attack you all. I do not care who they are. I will absolutely not let them get away with it.”</p>
 <p>“Big sister Fuyan, carefully and properly watch this. Watch how your little brother will take care of them.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Chu Feng flipped his palm. Not only did he break free from Qiushui Fuyan’s hand that grabbed onto his wrist, he instead grabbed her wrist.</p>
 <p>Then, as Chu Feng’s body shifted, Qiushui Fuyan felt that her surroundings became blurry. By the time her sight returned to normal, her expression had changed enormously.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because she and Chu Feng were now outside of the Misty Peak.</p>
 <p>In that sort of situation, Qiushui Fuyan subconsciously turned her gaze to Chu Feng beside her.</p>
 <p>Even though she was a Martial King, even though she had traveled with Huangfu Haoyue before, she had never experienced speed as fast as she had just now. They had instantly gone from inside the Misty Peak to the outside without alerting the spirit formation around the Misty Peak.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when Qiushui Fuyan was staring at Chu Feng, an even more astonishing scene appeared. Chu Feng waved his sleeve. Then, a formless wave swept forth. In an instant, it covered an area of ten thousand miles.</p>
 <p>Being enveloped by that wave, Qiu Canfeng, Xue Xiyue, Taikou and all the other people from the Misty Peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect all disappeared. When they reappeared, they were standing behind Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In fact, even the person that they thought to be a Martial Emperor, Huangfu Haoyue, had also been transported like everyone else. With a wave of Chu Feng’s sleeve, all of them had lost control of their bodies and appeared behind Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Heavens!” witnessing that scene, Qiushui Fuyan was stupefied. She no longer knew how to describe her state of mind. She was someone that had trained in martial cultivation for many years. Thus, she had attained some success. However, what Chu Feng had done just now was something that she had never seen before, something that was simply unheard of.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng?!”</p>
 <p>“Fuyan?!”</p>
 <p>“Fuyan, why would you bring Chu Feng here?!!”</p>
 <p>The others did not know that Chu Feng had teleported them next to him. Thus, they had puzzled expressions on their faces. They were confused as to what had happened. Especially after they saw Chu Feng, they all revealed extremely worried expressions.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because none of them wanted to involve Chu Feng in this battle. This was especially true after they discovered that the Blood Qilins were even more powerful than they had anticipated.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, it’s only a bunch of monstrous beasts. How could I trouble seniors with that bunch of evil animals? Just leave them all to this junior,” Chu Feng said to the crowd behind him with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you… could it be?!!!” The crowd were all shocked upon hearing those words. They subconsciously thought about how they were able to escape from the battle of life and death earlier and arrived behind Chu Feng, and how that might be related to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>But, what had happened earlier was truly too strange and too miraculous. If it was really done by Chu Feng, wouldn’t that mean that Chu Feng would, at the very minimum, be a Martial Emperor?</p>
 <p>However, many people also revealed expressions of worry after hearing that Chu Feng planned to take on the Blood Qilins by himself.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of what the crowd thought, they all subconsciously turned their gazes to Qiushui Fuyan. They all wished to obtain an answer from Qiushui Fuyan.</p>
 <p>As for Qiushui Fuyan, she did not say anything. Instead, an incomparably brilliant smile blossomed on her face. She took a glance at Chu Feng, then turned to the crowd and nodded.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd were all struck dumb. The reason for that was because the intention behind Qiushui Fuyan’s movements was very clear. She wanted to tell the crowd to believe in Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Believe in Chu Feng… didn’t that mean that Chu Feng was capable of handling the Blood Qilins by himself?</p>
 <p>“Brat, where did you come from? You dare to boast so shamelessly, saying that you will take care of our Blood Qilin Race?” At that moment, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief shouted coldly at Chu Feng. He had heard what Chu Feng said to Qiu Canfeng and the others.</p>
 <p>Over the past several years, they, the Blood Qilin Race, had risen in power rapidly. From a small power that was looked down upon by the Misty Peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect, they had become a huge monster that could withstand both the Misty Peak and Crippling Night Demon Sect by themselves.</p>
 <p>It would be understandable if someone didn’t know about their Blood Qilin Race. After all, they had emerged in power too quickly. Thus, they did not have enough time to expand their reputation.</p>
 <p>However, all those that had heard of them or seen them would all feel great respect toward them.</p>
 <p>Yet now, a brat like that actually dared to say those sorts of shameless words. As the Blood Qilin Race’s Clan Chief, he would naturally be furious.</p>
 <p>“Blood Qilins? You are clearly a bunch of red carps. Yet you actually dare to associate yourselves with the legendary Qilin? How shameless are you all?” Chu Feng said mockingly.</p>
 <p>“Ignorant bastard, did you know that our Clan Chief is a Martial Emperor?!”</p>
 <p>“Do you know what a Martial Emperor is?! It is an existence that has never appeared in the Eastern Sea Region before! To see such an expert, why are you still not on your knees?!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, get on your knees and beg for forgiveness! If you do that, then perhaps our Clan Chief might be in a good mood, and will consider leaving your corpse intact! Else, a sneeze from him would be capable of shattering your body and soul!”</p>
 <p>The arrogant and conceited Blood Qilins were extremely furious after being insulted by Chu Feng. One by one, they began to use their Clan Chief to threaten Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Martial Emperor? Hahahahahaha!!!”</p>
 <p>After hearing how the Blood Qilins bragged about their Clan Chief like so, Chu Feng burst into a loud laughter.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was not laughing because he was feeling in a good mood. Rather, it was because that bunch of monstrous beasts were truly too ridiculous, too funny.</p>
 <p>Before Chu Feng, they were nothing more than a bunch of ants. Yet, the ants actually felt themselves to be unparalleled; actually did not place Chu Feng in their eyes at all. As such, how could Chu Feng not laugh?</p>
