 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1627 - Face Covered With Tea</strong></p>
 <p>“Forget about it? Chu Feng, how could we just forget about it like this? You are our Nangong Imperial Clan’s honored guest. You should not have received such a humiliation,” Nangong Baihe said.</p>
 <p>“Baihe. I, Chu Feng, am not a member of the Nangong Imperial Clan. Even if they don’t like me, what can they possibly do to me? After a couple of days, I’ll be leaving.”</p>
 <p>“However, you all are different. You all will still have to live in the Nangong Imperial Clan. It’d be best for you to not go against them too badly. Even if you don’t care about yourself, you should still think for your little sister’s sake,” Chu Feng looked to Nangong Moli.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Nangong Baihe became silent. It was true. To her, Nangong Moli’s future outlook was many times more important than her own.</p>
 <p>“But, you’ve offended them today. I fear that with their temperament, they will not let you go,” Nangong Ya said.</p>
 <p>“So what? There are a lot of people who want to kill me. I don’t mind having a couple more. However, those who chase after me to kill me will, sooner or later, pay the price,” Chu Feng smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>Then, he said, “Come, let’s go. Let’s return and go eat something. Seeing all that delicious food on their tables has made me a bit hungry.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng spoke of this, Chu Feng began to walk toward his residence. His mood was extremely good. He had not been affected by what had happened earlier at all.</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng acting like this, Nangong Ya and Nangong Baihe looked to one another. The guilt and shame that they felt in their hearts lessened a lot. They never expected that Chu Feng would be such an upstanding person. Even encountering this sort of thing, he was still able to not take it to heart.</p>
 <p>At the same time, in the Eldest Prince Nangong Tianlong’s territory. Everyone was still present.</p>
 <p>“Brother Meng, it seems that your spirit formations are not as powerful as you anticipated them to be. How come it didn’t manage to injure Chu Feng at all?” Nangong Tianlong asked. At this moment, there was a trace of displeasure on his face.</p>
 <p>“Eldest Prince, please rest assured. How could Chu Feng possibly be able to receive my spirit formation without consequences? I dare to guarantee that Chu Feng has already been injured. After he returns, he will be suffering from pain. He will not be able to recover from it for a short period of time. Likely, even his cultivation will be damaged,” Meng Xiaoyan said.</p>
 <p>“That would be for the best,” Nangong Tianlong nodded, satisfied. Then, he looked to the teacup on the table, and a smile emerged on his face. He picked up the teacup and said, “Let’s drink. How could we waste the tea that Chu Feng served us to apologize?”</p>
 <p>“What big brother said is correct. Drink!” In response, Nangong Tianhu, Nangong Tianshi, Nangong Tianfeng and Meng Xiaoyan also picked up their teacups that had been served to them by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, the tea water in the teacups suddenly rushed out from the teacups and exploded like a waterfall, splattering all over Nangong Tianlong and the others’ faces.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that the tea water in the teacup had been tampered with, the water that had splattered out was not simply a cup of water. Rather, there was as much as a barrel of water.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Nangong Tianlong and the others were caught off guard. Thus, without a drop remaining, all of the tea water splattered onto their faces and bodies.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Nangong Tianlong, his three siblings and Meng Xiaoyan were all drenched with water. Their faces, their bodies and their hair were all covered with tea leaves. They had an extremely sorry appearance. It was extremely humiliating.</p>
 <p>“This…” At this moment, everyone present were stunned as they saw the appearances of Nangong Tianlong and the others. Exactly what had happened? How come they had turned into such a state when they were trying to drink their cups of tea?</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Nangong Tianlong crushed the teacup in his hand. He looked to Meng Xiaoyan and shouted with enormous anger, “Meng Xiaoyan, what is the meaning of this?”</p>
 <p>It was not only Nangong Tianlong that was enraged. Nangong Tianhu, Nangong Tianshi and Nangong Tianfeng were also enraged.</p>
 <p>Who were they? They were all Half Martial Emperors. How could ordinary water possibly be able to splatter onto their bodies?</p>
 <p>It was evident that the water had been altered by a spirit formation. Meng Xiaoyan was the only person capable of doing such a thing. After all, he was the only person who had altered the teapot and teacups.</p>
 <p>“You’re… you’re wrongly accusing me. It’s not me. If I were the one who did that, why would I put myself in such a state?” Meng Xiaoyan extended his hands and wiped away the tea water and tea leaves that covered his body. He had an expression of being wrongly accused.</p>
 <p>“If it’s not you, who else could it be? You were the only one who touched the teacups,” Nangong Tianfeng was so enraged that her little face turned very red. As the princess, what she cared about the most was her image. Yet, at this moment, her image was completely ruined.</p>
 <p>“But, there’s no reason for me to harm you all,” At this moment, Meng Xiaoyan was trying his best to excuse himself.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s not only Meng Xiaoyan who touched the teacups, Chu Feng also touched them,” Nangong Tianshi said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng shouldn’t have touched them. He merely poured tea into the teacups, and did not use his hands to touch them,” Nangong Tianfeng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. The teacups are completely fine. What changed was the tea water in the teacups. It’s most definitely that Chu Feng. He is definitely the one behind this,” Nangong Tianhu said.</p>
 <p>“He merely touched the teapot, yet was able to secretly tamper with the tea water within the teapot. Furthermore, not only did we not discover it, even Brother Meng, disciple of White-browed Immortal, did not discover it.”</p>
 <p>“No wonder Chu Feng declared earlier that the tea that he served was not something that just anyone could drink. Turns out that he had actually already plotted against us,” Nangong Tianlong said.</p>
 <p>“Right, he said those words before. Damn it, an unknown brat actually dared to behave this atrociously in our Nangong Imperial Clan. He is truly courting death!” Hearing what Nangong Tianlong said, Nangong Tianfeng and the others all firmly believed that it was Chu Feng’s doing.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only them that believed that it was Chu Feng’s doing. Even Meng Xiaoyan believed it to be Chu Feng’s doing. However, at this moment, he had a very ugly expression on his face. The reason for that was because this would mean that he had been the loser in the competition of world spirit techniques between him and Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…” Right at this moment when everyone was gnashing their teeth in anger, Nangong Tianlong suddenly laughed. Then, he said, “Chu Feng, is it? Interesting.”</p>
 <p>“Big brother, I’ll go and bring him back right away. You can handle the punishment,” Suddenly, Nangong Tianhu stood up.</p>
 <p>“Let it be. After all, he is a guest invited by Aunt Lian. I’m afraid it is out of question to do anything to him in the clan,” Nangong Tianlong shook his head.</p>
 <p>“So what if it’s Aunt Lian? She’s nothing more than a widow who has lost her husband and daughter. What makes her qualified to meddle in our business?” Nangong Tianfeng said.</p>
 <p>“There are some things you don’t understand. Aunt Lian is not frightening. However, the person behind her is,” Nangong Tianlong said.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Nangong Tianlong said, Nangong Tianfeng grew quiet. It was not only her, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi also went silent.</p>
 <p>The person behind Aunt Lian was indeed a person who they could not afford to provoke. Not to mention them, even their father wouldn’t be willing to provoke that person either.</p>
 <p>“What do we do then? Are we going to let him get away just like this?” Nangong Tianshi asked with a tone of unwillingness.</p>
 <p>“Let him get away? Heh… how could we possibly allow that?”</p>
 <p>“He is nothing more than a brat who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. We can take our time to slowly toy with him.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, there’s no need to be so anxious to take care of him. Sooner or later, I’ll let him know the consequences of opposing us.” As Nangong Tianlong said those words, a sinister light flashed through his eyes.</p>
