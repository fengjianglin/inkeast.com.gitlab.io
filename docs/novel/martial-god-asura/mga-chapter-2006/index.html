 <p><strong> Chapter 2006 - The Arrival Of Reinforcements</strong></p>
 <p>“Heavenly Law Palace, Mortal King Palace, you all truly have enormous dog’s guts!!!”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a loud shout exploded from the distant horizon.</p>
 <p>When that voice was heard, the expressions of practically everyone changed enormously. The reason for that was because they were all able to feel the power behind that voice. It was a rank eight Martial Emperor that had shouted.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, another rank eight Martial Emperor had appeared.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, soon an old man appeared. It was another Grand Elder of the Ancient Era’s Elves, Lord Luokong.</p>
 <p>Not long after Lord Luokong appeared, several hundred thousand soldiers in green armor arrived in the sky in an orderly manner.</p>
 <p>They were the elites of the Ancient Era’s Elves. Lord Luokong had led an army of elite Ancient Era’s Elves here.</p>
 <p>“Heavens!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, not only were the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace stunned, even the bystanders were stunned. At that moment, they did not know how to describe their current state of mind.</p>
 <p>They were all stunned by the scene before them. Although the army of hundreds of thousands from the Ancient Era’s Elves were greatly inferior to the Three Palaces’ armies of millions in terms in numbers, the Ancient Era’s Elves’ army of hundreds of thousands were their true elites.</p>
 <p>Their overwhelming might immediately suppressed the Three Palaces’ armies the moment they appeared on the scene.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd was finally able to realize how powerful the Ancient Era’s Elves were.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the Ancient Era’s Elves were the strongest power in the Holy Land of Martialism. They were an existence that the Three Palaces could not compare with.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace, even if the Underworld Palace were to join hands with them, they would likely not be a match for the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>“It’s over. The Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s decision this time around was truly a mistake.”</p>
 <p>“Making Chu Feng an enemy was their greatest mistake. Likely, they will suffer a calamity today.”</p>
 <p>After the Underworld Palace joined the battle, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace had already entered a disadvantaged state And now, the Ancient Era’s Elves had arrived with a large force to assist the Cyanwood Mountain. Without a doubt, this would force the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace into desperate straits.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the others, even the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters had dejected expressions on their faces. They both knew that they were powerless to reverse this battle now.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master shouted, “Stop!!!”</p>
 <p>He turned to his subordinates and spoke with a loud voice. “Everyone from the Heavenly Law Palace, cease your attacks.”</p>
 <p>“Everyone from the Mortal King Palace, cease fighting,” In response, the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master also ordered his subordinates to stop fighting.</p>
 <p>Not only were they ordering their subordinates to stop fighting, they themselves did not dare to continue fighting against Lord Lianghua and the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master. Instead, the two of them began to withdraw.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>Although the two of them did not dare to fight back, Lord Lianghua and the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master did not act leniently toward them at all. As the two of them continued to attack the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters, they both managed to find gaps in their defenses. Ruthlessly, they managed to slash the bodies of their opponents.</p>
 <p>Lord Lianghua directly hacked off the Mortal King Palace Master’s arm.</p>
 <p>As for the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master, he was even more ruthless. Not only did he managed to hack off one of the Heavenly Law Palace Master’s arms, he had also hacked off his shoulder.</p>
 <p>That said, even though they were feeling pain from having their arms hacked off, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master merely bit down on their teeth to endure the pain without uttering a sound.</p>
 <p>“Well then, let’s stop.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master and Lord Lianghua had originally wanted to continue attacking them. However, Lord Luokong suddenly arrived beside them and stopped them.</p>
 <p>“They dared to look down on us Ancient Era’s Elves. They should be killed,” Lord Lianghua said.</p>
 <p>“Lord Luokong, what Lord Lianghua says is entirely correct,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master began to add oil to fire.</p>
 <p>“I am under orders from His Majesty that we must not eliminate the Heavenly Law Palace,” Lord Luokong said to Lord Lianghua through voice transmission.</p>
 <p>Lord Lianghua was startled upon hearing those words. Then, still angry, he said via voice transmission, “Then we’ll eliminate the Mortal King Palace.”</p>
 <p>“Lianghua, calm yourself. Do not forget what we Ancient Era’s Elves promised Lord Qing Xuantian,” Lord Luokong urged against it.</p>
 <p>Lord Lianghua started to gnash his teeth in anger. His fists were clenched so tightly that cracking sounds could be heard. Originally, someone like Lord Lianghua would have great control over his state of mind.</p>
 <p>However, this time around, he was unable to control his state of mind. He was truly enraged by the actions and conduct of the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace. However, he was not allowed to eliminate them. This caused him to feel extremely sullen.</p>
 <p>“Everyone from the Underworld Palace, stop attacking,” The Underworld Palace’s Palace Master was an intelligent individual. He was able to tell that the Ancient Era’s Elves did not plan to eradicate the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace. Thus, he ordered his men to stop.</p>
 <p>In fact, after the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace ceased their attacks, Chu Feng had already ordered the Cyanwood Mountain’s people to stop attacking. At that moment, the battle was halted.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, please come over here,” Lord Luokong waved at Chu Feng with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>He knew that while the Cyanwood Mountain’s leader was actually Baili Xuankong, the person that actually possessed the authority to speak was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Lord Luokong,” After Chu Feng arrived, he courteously greeted Lord Luokong.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I know that your mood is extremely bad right now. Truth be told, I have come here with the orders from His Majesty that we must not eliminate the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace.”</p>
 <p>“It is not that His Majesty is being lenient and merciful toward them. Rather, there is a reason behind it. To put it simply, Qing Xuantian asked our Ancient Era’s Elves to, regardless of how excessive the human powers might act, not eradicate those human powers that had existed for tens of thousands of years, and only to teach them a lesson.”</p>
 <p>“You are a very smart individual. I believe you should understand what I mean,” Lord Luokong said to Chu Feng in a very apologetic manner. Of course, he spoke to Chu Feng through voice transmission. Thus, only Chu Feng heard him.</p>
 <p>“Junior understands,” Chu Feng replied through voice transmission. Then, Chu Feng said openly, “Lord Luokong, today, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace have not only attacked our Cyanwood Mountain, they have also looked down upon the Ancient Era’s Elves. If it wasn’t for the assistance from the Underworld Palace’s Palace Master, they might really have dared to kill Lord Lianghua.”</p>
 <p>“As you are the senior, I will not concern myself with that matter. You and Lord Lianghua can handle it,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Two dogs, why are you still standing there? Immediately kneel down and apologize to little friend Chu Feng and Lord Lianghua,” Lord Luokong pointed at the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters.</p>
 <p>At that moment, in order to survive, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace master knelt in midair toward Chu Feng and Lord Lianghua without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>This scene was visible to all the crowd. It was also because of this scene that the crowd realized how powerful the Ancient Era’s Elves really were.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters were akin to gods in the minds of the people of the world.</p>
 <p>However, these two gods were now kneeling and apologizing. They knew that this was not due to Chu Feng, nor was it due to Lord Lianghua. Rather, it was due to the strength of the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
