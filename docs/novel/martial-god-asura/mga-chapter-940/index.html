 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 940 - Shameless You Mingdeng</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Royal Armaments weren’t objects ordinary Martial Kings could create. They demanded not only cultivation of a Martial King, but also the realm of a Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why there was a limited number of Royal Armaments despite there being quite a few Martial Kings—there was not a single Royal-cloak World Spiritist in the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Armaments were the same. Not just any Martial Emperor could create Imperial Armaments, because there was still the second requirement: being an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a fairly normal occurrence for a Martial Emperor to forge a Royal Armament; however, undoubtedly, a Royal Armament that came from a Royal-cloak Martial Emperor would have superior quality to one that came from a Royal-cloak Martial King. As for this Demon Sealing Sword, it likely came from a Martial Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, the formation that surrounds the Demon Sealing Sword seems to be changed,” Eggy said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon a careful inspection, Chu Feng found that the formation surrounding the Demon Sealing Sword had indeed changed. There were layers of closely connected circles, and there were ten layers in total. The pressure within every layer was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They didn’t switch the formation; they just changed something from the original one. It must be the work of those Protectors, but I have no clue what they’re preparing to do,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, these foolish clowns still dare to select a sect head! Don’t they know the person who’s fulfilled all requirements is here already?” Eggy said as she giggled. The person she spoke of was naturally Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter. We still have time anyway, so we can watch the show they put up.” Chu Feng lightly smiled, and prepared himself for a good spectacle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, the reason You Mingdeng treated him so poorly was solely because he feared Chu Feng’s potential. He, You Mingdeng, feared his position would be affected if Chu Feng continued staying in the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He was afraid of Chu Feng’s ever increasing fame, which would push him to become the sect head eventually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But today, when You Mingdeng plotted to rise to the role of sect head, Chu Feng was already all prepared. No matter what You Mingdeng did, Chu Feng would make all his plans fall flat, because this position was Chu Feng’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, I’m extremely grateful to all of you for returning to the Crippling Night Demon Sect from faraway places and peaceful established lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had thought, with us three old bones’ rallying power, there’d definitely be quite a few brothers who would be willing to rejoin the Crippling Night Demon Sect and recreate our dominion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had never, however, expected it to be this powerful. After being separated for so many years, just some words from us recalled millions of brothers. This has truly exceeded my imaginations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I feel joy, I must say that I also feel grateful. I thank you all—I thank you, my brothers. If Sect Head is up in heaven, he must also feel very relieved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>You Mingdeng stood up, and spoke with a solemn and appreciative tone. He even deeply bowed to the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s members in an expression of his gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brothers! Do you remember our Crippling Night Demon Sect’s mantra? Do you remember the declarations when we joined the Crippling Night Demon Sect?” shouted someone amongst the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I share my lives with the Crippling Night Demon Sect! I share my dignity with the Crippling Night Demon Sect! When the sect is honoured, I am honoured! When the sect is shamed, I am shamed! When the sect lives, I live! When the sect dies, I die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first shout was the catalyst for the response of the entire crowd. The ones within the palace were the first to shout, then the ones within the tunnel, then, in the end, everyone—over ten million members—who gathered in the Depraved Ravine shouted in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“WHEN THE SECT LIVES, I LIVE. WHEN THE SECT DIES, I DIE!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Crippling Night Demon Sect’s declaration was even more deafening than thunder. It not only shook the lands, it shook everyone’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! My brothers are indeed all courageous men! You are indeed dragons amongst men!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, a crowd of dragons cannot lack a leader—the Crippling Night Demon Sect is the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it weren’t for a lack of leadership in so many years, we wouldn’t have allowed that Immortal Execution Archipelago to rise in power, nor would we have allowed them to disgrace us like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, we are facing a crisis. We cannot sit and await death. We must engage in a counterattack, but before doing so we must find a suitable leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Today, we have asked all of you to assemble here just for this. I’m sure there’s a fitting leader in everyone’s hearts right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if I’m not mistaken, many of you wish for the leader to arise from us Four Protector, and of those people, half of them certainly hope that Qiu Canfeng enters that role.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. At this moment, the person most qualified to become sect head is undoubtedly Big Brother Qiu Canfeng. He is the leader of the Four Protectors, but sadly, Big Brother Qiu Canfeng has disappeared for nearly two years. I haven’t even heard anything from him as of yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though the Crippling Night Demon Sect is about to begin fighting the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he hasn’t appeared yet. However, from what I know of him, he is absolutely not a person who ignores such matters. If he knows we will soon battle, he would definitely stand out for us, and even be the first to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But now, he hasn't. This doesn’t make sense. I have even searched through his residence but I saw no sign of him. No one knows where he’s gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no reason for Big Brother Qiu Canfeng to disappear. So, there is only one explanation—he has been met with misfortune, and has been struck by the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s venomous hands,” You Mingdeng said quite sorrowfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Great Protector Qiu Canfeng…” Everyone was astonished. They found great difficulty in accepting this as an indescribable sadness and shock spread throughout the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is truly shameless. For his own benefit, he says my master is dead!” Chu Feng cursed in his heart. He, at last, had seen signs of You Mingdeng’s shamelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although it is only a guess, it is likely true. Although Big Brother Qiu Canfeng is powerful, I’m sure you all know that the Immortal Execution Archipelago has an old monster—Murong Mingtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Murong Mingtian is able to even defeat Lady Piaomiao, and I’m afraid only the sect head, if he were alive, could stand a chance against him. Even if Big Brother Qiu Canfeng were to fight him, he would likely be defeated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at that moment, Xue Xiyue also spoke. Even her eyes were a bit red—she had a face of fake sadness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Avenge Great Protector, avenge Great Protector!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A debt of blood must be paid in blood! A debt of blood must be paid in blood!” shouted someone loudly. Quickly following that were others who also raised their fists and yelled. Their voices were like thunder, every single word loud and clear. One could thus see that Qiu Canfeng held a very high position in all of their hearts, his position even surpassing the other three Protectors combined.</span></p>
