 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1675 - A Request</strong></p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, please,” Du Xiangyu said to Chu Feng while smiling beamingly. Her appearance was very amiable and she waved toward the cave behind her, beckoning Chu Feng to enter.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he actually did not want to enter the cave. However, he knew that even if he didn’t want to enter the cave, he must still enter it. Thus, with no other option, he entered the cave.</p>
 <p>After entering the cave, a guest room was arranged for him. He was the only person in the guest room.</p>
 <p>Even though he was the only person at the guest room, the Du Clan had still prepared dimsum for him. Chu Feng did not try to be courteous. As he had tired himself out for this many days, how could he not eat the fine food presented to him?</p>
 <p>If Goudan’er and the others were to see that Chu Feng actually dared to enjoyably eat the dimsum presented by the Du Clan, they would definitely be scared senseless.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was not afraid. Even Du Wanwu’s Divine Poison was unable to do anything to him, how could the poison from the rest of the Du Clan possibly be able to affect him?</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng firmly believed that the people from the Du Clan would not dare to poison the dimsum. After all, even if they were to poison the food, it would not be able to affect Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was only after a long while that Du Xiangyu walked in with Du Wanwu. Evidently, the two of them had been discussing things with one another before coming here. Else, the hostility Du Wanwu had toward Chu Feng would not be decreased by this much.</p>
 <p>The first sentence that Du Xiangyu said after she arrived came as a shock to Chu Feng. However, he seemed to have anticipated something like that.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I do not like to keep people in suspense. Thus, I’ll get to the main point right away. There is a matter that I wish your help with,” Du Xiangyu said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, there is no harm in telling me what the matter is,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Truth be told, back then, our clan’s Ancestor, the Poison Demon, had set up the Poison Mist Formation in the sky, beneath the ground and all around this place after coming here.”</p>
 <p>“I believe you also know that he set it up in order to guard against his great enemies, the Three Palaces.”</p>
 <p>“However, what you do not know is that not only does that Poison Mist Formation prevent others from coming in, it also prevents us from going out.”</p>
 <p>“The people outside cannot come in, and the people inside cannot go out. There was actually a reason why our Ancestor did that.”</p>
 <p>“He felt that if his descendants were unable to even open his Poison Mist Formation, they would not be qualified to enter the Holy Land of Martialism, and even less qualified to encounter the people from the Three Palaces.”</p>
 <p>“As matters stand, a total of fifteen thousand years have passed. The people of our clan have already grown accustomed to the peaceful days that we enjoy now.”</p>
 <p>“However, Wanwu is a rare poison genius who has never appeared since the days of our Ancestor. Furthermore, his Divine Power is also a type of poison. This is extremely rare and hard to come by.”</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, Wanwu’s birth is simply the grace shown to our Du Clan by the heavens. I do not wish for him to spend the rest of his life ordinarily in this valley floor. I want him to go out into the Holy Land of Martialism and experience the rest of the world,” Du Xiangyu said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you mean to say that even you all are unable to break through that Poison Mist Formation?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That is precisely the case. With this many years passing, there have been many people from the Holy Land of Martialism who tried to charge through the Poison Mist Formation. However, all of them died.”</p>
 <p>“As for our Du Clan, there have also been many who wanted to charge through the Poison Mist Formation and enter the Holy Land of Martialism. However, they too were all killed by the Poison Mist Formation,” When mentioning this matter, Du Xiangyu smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Senior, in that case, what help could I provide?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I hope that you will be able to bring Wanwu out,” Du Xiangyu said.</p>
 <p>“Me, bring him out?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown. He said, “Senior, even I myself do not know how I managed to pass through the Poison Mist Formation. Whether or not I’ll be able to leave through the Poison Mist Formation safely is something that I do not know. Thus, how could I possibly be able to take Du Wanwu with me?”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I discovered you the moment you arrived here, and I have been secretly monitoring you. You possess a body immune to poisons. I dare to guarantee that the Poison Mist Formation will definitely not be able to harm you,” Du Xiangyu said.</p>
 <p>“But even if I possess a body immune to poisons, I can only guarantee that I myself will not be affected by poisons. How could I bring Du Wanwu along with me?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“You do not have to worry about that. I have a method that will allow you to bring at least two other people out with you. However, you only need to bring Wanwu with you.”</p>
 <p>“Also, rest assured. I will not make you help us for free. I have already discussed the matter you spoke of earlier with Wanwu.”</p>
 <p>“Rules are dead, whereas people are living. Back then, Ancestor had set up those rules thinking about our Du Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, Wanwu and I had decided that we would make an exception, and restore the freedom of those villagers. They will be able to peacefully coexist with the people from our Du Clan in this valley.”</p>
 <p>“As for the poison plants that the people from our Du Clan used to cultivate with, they shall be grown by our Du Clan ourselves.”</p>
 <p>“However, I know that little friend Chu Feng still has a second demand. May I know what this second demand might be?” Du Xiangyu asked.</p>
 <p>“My second condition is that I wish to obtain the Fire Immortal Profound Technique,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you think about it!” Hearing those words, Du Wanwu was immediately enraged.</p>
 <p>“Wanwu,” However, Du Xiangyu was rather calm. She took a light glance at Du Wanwu.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Du Wanwu sat back down. Merely, he still had an angry expression on his face. Even though Du Wanwu was an uncommunicative person, he was a very hot-blooded individual and was not proficient in disguising his mood.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I actually already guessed that you would ask that. You possess five secret skills. If I am not mistaken, one of them is the Water Immortal Profound Technique, right?” Du Xiangyu said.</p>
 <p>“Water Immortal Profound Technique? It’s that secret skill as equally famous as the Fire Immortal profound Technique?” Du Wanwu was startled to hear those words. His face revealed a shocked expression.</p>
 <p>Even though he was able to tell that Chu Feng possessed five secret skills, he had never expected that one of them would be a secret skill as equally famous as the Fire Immortal Profound Technique.</p>
 <p>However, he could not be blamed for this. After all, Du Wanwu had never even seen the Fire Immortal Profound Technique before. Thus, how could he possibly know what the Water Immortal Profound Technique would be like?</p>
 <p>However, after hearing the words ‘Water Immortal Profound Technique’, he was able to guess that the secret skill that Chu Feng had used to create a humanoid out of water should be the Water Immortal Profound Technique.</p>
 <p>“Senior’s eyesight is truly amazing,” Chu Feng said while smiling. He had indirectly answered Du Xiangyu’s question.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng had confirmed it, the expression of shock on Du Wanwu’s face grew even more intense. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng became even more complicated.</p>
 <p>“Actually, I was merely guessing,” Du Xiangyu smiled lightly. As she spoke, she stood up and said, “Actually, if you want the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, I am able to hand it to you.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, after our Ancestor, there has never been anyone capable of obtaining the Fire Immortal Profound Technique. It is not that easy to obtain.”</p>
 <p>“However, if little friend Chu Feng is interested, you can give it a try. However, little friend Chu Feng, I must warn you first. The place where the Fire Immortal Profound Technique is placed in is a place where the people of our Du Clan can enter and leave as they wish. However, for outsiders, it is an extremely dangerous place.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because it is our Du Clan’s number one forbidden area, the Inheritance Hall,” Du Xiangyu said.</p>
 <p>“If senior is really willing to allow junior to take the Fire Immortal Profound Technique away, then junior will definitely be willing to enter that place and give it a try,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
