 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1572 - One Shot Lightning</strong></p>
 <p>“Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash!!!”</p>
 <p>At this time, Chu Feng brandished the Infinity Edge in his hand once again and actually unleashed his strongest attack, Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash, again.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, nine more slashes were shot forth. Energy ripples began to wreak havoc throughout the region again. Furthermore, due to the fact that, the sea monster was slow-witted, the nine slashes of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash all landed on it again.</p>
 <p>However, that sea monster was truly too powerful. Even though it was riddled with scars, it still possessed enormous might. It was simply unable to feel pain at all. The only thing it felt was surging anger and killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly brandished the Infinity Edge in his hand and launched a slash towards Nangong Baihe. However, after this slash landed, Nangong Baihe was undamaged. The power that had bound her was neutralized by Chu Feng. She had managed to regain her freedom.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Nangong Moli’s binding was also neutralized by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After removing Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli’s bindings, Chu Feng brandished his Infinity Edge and shouted, “Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash!!!” He had actually unleashed his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash for the third time.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Nangong Baihe was stunned. She was able to tell that Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash was an extremely powerful technique. Yet, she was also able to tell that this sort of technique required one to pay an enormous price to unleash.</p>
 <p>To use it once would be fine for Chu Feng. However, he was actually using it three times in succession. This, to Chu Feng, would be an enormous burden. For the sake of saving them, Chu Feng was really giving his all and putting his life on the line.</p>
 <p>If it were in the past, Nangong Baihe would definitely grab onto Nangong Moli and escape this place as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>However, she was unable to do so now. It was truly impossible for her to do that. She could not abandon Chu Feng and escape with her lil’ sis.</p>
 <p>That was because she knew very well that if it hadn’t been for Chu Feng, she and her lil’ sis would have already died. They would have been eaten alive or torn to shreds by that sea monster.</p>
 <p>Even though she, Nangong Baihe, feared death, she was unable to kick her benefactor in the teeth and escape.</p>
 <p>“Lil’ sis, run away,” Thus, Nangong Baihe was determined to stay. She urged her lil sis to escape.</p>
 <p>“No, if you’re not escaping, I’m not escaping either,” Nangong Moli firmly grabbed onto Nangong Baihe’s hand. She was determined to not let go.</p>
 <p>“Wuuuaaooo~~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, another ear-piercing roar sounded from that sea monster. The entire spirit formation started to tremble violently. Numerous energy ripples pounded against Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli, nearly knocking them away. They were unable to even stand steadily anymore.</p>
 <p>It turned out that Chu Feng had finished using his third successive Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash. Even though that sea monster was badly mutilated beyond recognition after going through three Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slashes, it was still standing strong. It wasn’t dead. Furthermore, at this moment, its mouth was wide open as it charged towards Chu Feng to tear him apart.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that I can only use this.”</p>
 <p>The corners of Chu Feng’s lips suddenly raised into a light smile. Even though he was feeling incomparably weak, he had not given up. Instead, a flash of determination shone through his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Aooouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Finally, the sea monster reached Chu Feng. It was less than a meter away from Chu Feng. At this moment, the lightning in Chu Feng’s eyes became exceptionally fierce. It was as if a long-dormant god had finally woken up.</p>
 <p>Before this ruler, who dares to challenge?</p>
 <p>“Zzzzzzzzzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s body suddenly started to spin rapidly. At the same time, countless bolts of lightning shot out from his body explosively like sharp swords.</p>
 <p>That scene appeared like a torrential rain, a blossom, of countless lightnings, the dance of a group of demons.</p>
 <p>“This power, exactly what’s going on?!!!”</p>
 <p>Nangong Baihe’s eyes were fixed onto Chu Feng the entire time. When those colored lightnings shot out from Chu Feng’s body, her eyes shone, and her expression changed.</p>
 <p>At that time, she felt a feeling she had never felt before. It was the feeling of oppression, an extremely frightening oppression. However, she was uncertain as to whether that feeling was actually a feeling of oppression.</p>
 <p>However, she was certain of one thing. That was, that the bolts of lightning being released from Chu Feng’s body were extremely powerful. It was a power that she had never seen before, a power that she could not describe.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, at the moment when the bolts of lightning appeared, the Imperial Bloodline in her body actually began to have a strange change. It was as if it had been affected by them.</p>
 <p>This was a sensation she had never felt before. Thus, she found it extremely unfathomable.</p>
 <p>The lightning continued to flash for quite some time before gradually dissipating. When it disappeared completely, that sea monster was also gone. Evidently, it was dead. It had been killed by Chu Feng’s lightning attack.</p>
 <p>Merely, Chu Feng had also lost an arm and blood had already dyed his clothes.</p>
 <p>“It’s still a bit lacking. I am still not proficient enough.” As if he were not feeling any pain at all, Chu Feng was reflecting on the attack he had used earlier.</p>
 <p>The attack earlier was an attack created by releasing the power of his bloodline. This was not the first time that Chu Feng had used it. When he defeated Qin Wentian, Chu Feng had also used this attack.</p>
 <p>Merely, at that time, Chu Feng had used this attack effortlessly. However, it was different this time around. Chu Feng had only used it at the moment of imminent peril, the moment of this life and death crisis. Chu Feng knew that the power of his lightning would only be stronger the closer the sea monster was to him. In turn, this would give him a higher chance of killing that sea monster.</p>
 <p>However, he had still been a bit too slow. That was why his left arm had ended up being bitten off by the sea monster.</p>
 <p>However, this result caused Chu Feng immense joy. He had seen that rank six Martial Emperor-level sea monster being destroyed by his lightning with his own eyes, without even a speck remaining.</p>
 <p>This signified how powerful Chu Feng’s bloodline was. Even though Chu Feng had only managed to grasp the tip of the iceberg, this mere portion of his bloodline’s power still surpassed his strongest martial skill.</p>
 <p>This was something worthy of being happy over. This was because it meant that Chu Feng possessed the power to kill rank six Half Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>What did it mean by heaven-defying? This was what it meant by heaven-defying.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng felt that it was time to give a name to his certain killing technique using his bloodline’s power.</p>
 <p>One Shot Lightning, this was the name Chu Feng decided on.</p>
 <p>One Shot Lightning required it to be used within a very close distance in order to reveal its strongest might. Furthermore, Chu Feng would be enormously exhausted after using it. This was an attack that Chu Feng would only use when fighting against true experts.</p>
 <p>As implied by its name, One Shot Lightning was a do-or-die technique. However, it was also the strongest attack that Chu Feng was currently able to grasp.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, how are you feeling? Are you alright?” Right at this time, Nangong Baihe had run over. Her eyes were fixed onto Chu Feng nervously. She was extremely worried about him.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, your arm.” Soon, Nangong Moli also ran over. When she saw that Chu Feng was missing an arm, her eyes immediately started to redden.</p>
 <p>“Foolish girl, this is nothing. Look, isn’t my arm completely fine?” With a thought, Chu Feng regenerated his lost limb through the use of a spirit formation. It was completely undamaged and appeared exactly the same as his lost arm.</p>
 <p>With Chu Feng’s current world spirit techniques, as long as his consciousness and dantian remained undamaged, he would be akin to having an undying body. For something like losing an arm, other than feeling a certain amount of pain, it was actually nothing more than a superficial wound.</p>
 <p>“Wow, big brother is amazing!” Seeing that Chu Feng’s arm was restored, Nangong Moli started to smile happily.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I’m sorry. I should have trusted you,” Nangong Baihe had an apologetic expression all over her face. She knew that while Chu Feng’s arm was fine, his body was not. To use the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash three times in succession would be an enormous burden on his body regardless of how tough his body might be. Even though Chu Feng appeared to be fine, he was actually in very weak health.</p>
 <p>“It’s all in the past. All that matters is that you two are fine,” Chu Feng smiled. He had only appeared to deliberately leave back then, and had not really left. That was because he had already considered Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli as his friends. Thus, he would not watch as his friends threw their lives away.</p>
 <p>“Why did you return? Is it really worth doing so for us?” Nangong Baihe suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>“Definitely,” Chu Feng replied with a light smile.</p>
 <p>However, this simple word stunned Nangong Baihe. At this moment, she felt warmth in her heart. It was as if all of the unpleasant things in her heart had been melted away by Chu Feng’s single word.</p>
