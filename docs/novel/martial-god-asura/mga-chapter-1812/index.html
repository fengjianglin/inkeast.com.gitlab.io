 <p><strong>&nbsp;MGA: Chapter 1812 - Reappearance Of The Avaricious Immortal</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior Hong Qiang, this dual sword is quite good. It suits you very well. Please accept it,” Chu Feng handed an Incomplete Imperial Armament that a rank two Martial Emperor was using before to Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>As that Incomplete Imperial Armament was, after all, something used by a rank two Martial Emperor, it was one of the better quality Incomplete Imperial Armaments of the seven Incomplete Imperial Armaments Chu Feng had obtained. Although it was inferior to Chu Feng’s Heavenly Immortal Sword, it was on par with Chu Feng’s Cyan Rainbow Sword and Purple Rainbow Sword.</p>
 <p>“This…” Hong Qiang wanted to decline.</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t refuse it. I have this many Incomplete Imperial Armaments with me. If you don’t accept it, I will only end up selling it,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I’ll accept it,” Hong Qiang received the Incomplete Imperial Armament.</p>
 <p>Even though Hong Qiang was a Martial Emperor now, he did not possess an Incomplete Imperial Armament. After all, Incomplete Imperial Armaments were extremely precious.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for the fact that they were from the Four Great Imperial Clans, how could one possibly obtain that many Incomplete Imperial Armaments? As far as Hong Qiang knew, of the Nine Powers, the Sword Crafting Villa possessed the most Incomplete Imperial Armaments. However, even with that being the case, they only possessed three Incomplete Imperial Armaments.</p>
 <p>As for the other powers of the Nine Powers, it would already be very decent should they be able to possess two Incomplete Imperial Armaments. In fact, some among them only possessed a single Incomplete Imperial Armament. Furthermore, they would be deemed to be their sect’s protective treasure, in the possession of people at the level of Assembly Masters, and passed on from generation to generation.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this moment, he was actually able to obtain an Incomplete Imperial Armament himself. Furthermore, its quality was extremely good. As such, how could Hong Qiang not be joyous?</p>
 <p>Furthermore, as the master of that Incomplete Imperial Armament was already dead, Hong Qiang was able to easily subdue it and make it be used by him. Today, Hong Qiang had truly profited enormously.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, he’s actually using our clan’s Incomplete Imperial Armament as a repayment for a favor?! Furthermore, he said that he was planning to sell it?!”</p>
 <p>As they saw how Chu Feng had obtained all those treasures, and had actually given away one of the Incomplete Imperial Armaments before their faces, the people from the Four Clans were all gnashing their teeth in anger and envy.</p>
 <p>Those Incomplete Imperial Armaments had only been obtained by the Four Great Imperial Clans throughout the years by entering many Ancient Era’s remnants at the price of the deaths of many experts.</p>
 <p>Yet, today, Chu Feng had actually seized all of them. Naturally, they would feel unreconciled.</p>
 <p>In fact, at this moment, the Four Great Imperial Clans’ magnificent army of thousands of men had already encircled Chu Feng and Hong Qiang from afar.</p>
 <p>However, they were only able to encircle them from afar. Furthermore, none of them dared to attack Chu Feng and Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>At this moment, practically all of the Martial Emperors from the Four Great Imperial Clans had been pinned down by their enemies.</p>
 <p>Those underneath rank two Martial Emperor were either dead or wounded. Even those who were still alive did not dare to approach Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng was able to kill even rank two Martial Emperors. As such, how could any rank one Martial Emperor dare to attack him? If they were to do that, they would simply be throwing their lives away.</p>
 <p>“If only I had tried to enter deeper into that palace hall. Perhaps I might have been able to obtain treasures capable of killing rank three Martial Emperors. If I had been able to do so, I would’ve been able to help Ancestor escape from the siege.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng stored away his treasures, he did not leave right away. Instead, he looked to Baili Xuankong, who was still fighting bitterly.</p>
 <p>He was regretting the fact that he had not made it deeper into the palace hall Long Lin had opened that day. Although it might have been extremely dangerous, although he might have been killed by that Qilin, it was also possible that he would have been able to subdue that Qilin.</p>
 <p>After all, in that palace hall, only one’s talent mattered.</p>
 <p>If he had entered deeper, it would’ve been better than the current situation that he was placed in. At this moment, Chu Feng could only watch as the Snow-haired Immortal, the Compass Immortal and Baili Xuankong fought for him without being able to do anything.</p>
 <p>“Hong Qiang, why are you still standing there? Quickly, take Chu Feng away!” Seeing that Chu Feng and Hong Qiang had yet to escape, Baili Xuankong shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, let’s go. We are unable to interfere with their battles.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, they are all doing this for your sake. If you are to escape now, they might be able to escape later. However, if you are to continue to stay here, you will only wear out their strength, and might even bring harm to them,” After Hong Qiang said those words, he grabbed Chu Feng and began to escape.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right after the two men turned around, a golden-bright and dazzling spirit formation appeared from all directions and covered the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Dragon Mark world spirit formation?” Seeing the spirit formation before his eyes, Chu Feng started to frown. The White-browed Immortal was already dead. Thus, why would there be another Dragon Mark world spirit formation? There was definitely another Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist working for the Four Great Imperial Clans.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk… little friend Chu Feng, no matter what, we’re old acquaintances. You shouldn’t be this urgent to leave.”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, after the Dragon Mark world spirit formation appeared, a familiar figure appeared outside of the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>This man was one of the Ten Immortals. Furthermore, Chu Feng also knew him. He was the Avaricious Immortal.</p>
 <p>Back in Mooncloud City, this Avaricious Immortal had tried to prevent Baili Xuankong from escaping with Chu Feng. Never had Chu Feng expected that he would come to prevent him from escaping again today.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, judging from his appearance, he must have waited here for a long time for the chance to ambush Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious Immortal, you are truly despicable. Remember this! With how you kept going against me repeatedly, I, Chu Feng, will definitely make you die miserably!” Chu Feng’s eyes were surging with coldness. He was truly feeling bitter hatred for the Avaricious Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, little friend Chu Feng, what you said is extremely true. Someone like me does deserve to die. However, it would still have to depend on whether or not you have the opportunity to kill me.”</p>
 <p>The Avaricious Immortal laughed mischievously. Then, he looked to the four Supreme Elders in the distant and shouted, “Four Elders, Chu Feng’s life is currently in my hands. Say, should I kill him or not?”</p>
 <p>“Kill him! Avaricious Immortal, please kill him! As long as you kill him, our Four Great Imperial Clans will definitely thank you with vast treasures,” The Four Supreme Elders spoke in unison.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious, you dare?! If you dare to touch my disciple, I will make you meet a fate more miserable than death!” The Snow-haired Immortal said furiously.</p>
 <p>“Snow-haired Immortal, I know of your temperament. Even if I am to let Chu Feng off today, you will definitely not spare me.”</p>
 <p>“Since I have shown myself, that means that I do not fear you,” The Avaricious Immortal smiled complacently. Then, he said, “Four Lord Elders, I do not need you all to thank me with vast treasures. I merely need you all to agree to one thing. As long as I kill Chu Feng, all of his treasures shall be mine, and you all will not look into it anymore. Is that fine?”</p>
 <p>“......” Hearing those words, the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans became extremely enraged. This Avaricious Immortal was seizing the opportunity to plunder them by making an extravagant demand again.</p>
 <p>Although he had not requested anything specific this time, the number of treasures Chu Feng possessed were too many to count. Not to mention what he possessed, merely the number of Incomplete Imperial Armaments that he had snatched away from the Four Great Imperial Clans was already extremely numerous.</p>
 <p>Even though those Incomplete Imperial Armaments had already been seized by Chu Feng, it remained that they were their Four Great Imperial Clans’ possessions. What the Avaricious Immortal had said was simply equivalent to seizing those treasures for himself.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Avaricious, do it, kill him,” The four Supreme Elders did not hesitate in the slightest, and spoke decisively. They knew very well that, compared to Chu Feng’s life, those treasures could not amount to anything.</p>
 <p>“Righto,” Hearing those words, the smile on the Avaricious Immortal’s face grew even stronger. Then, he turned his treacherous gaze to Chu Feng and said, “Little friend Chu Feng, you must not blame this Immortal for being ruthless. It is simply that I must help those who pay me to avoid calamities. Furthermore, you bullied my disciple that day. As such, how could I possibly let you live?”</p>
 <p>As he said those words, deep hatred flashed through the Avaricious Immortal’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right after he finished saying those words, the Avaricious Immortal sprayed out a mouthful of blood onto the spirit formation before him.</p>
 <p>“......” Seeing this scene, not to mention the others, even Chu Feng and Hong Qiang were startled.</p>
 <p>Didn’t this Avaricious Immortal want to kill him? Why would he be vomiting blood instead?</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared behind the Avaricious Immortal.</p>
 <p>This person was wearing a black cloak that concealed his body and appearance. However, the cloak was incapable of hiding his aura. He was a rank four Martial Emperor.</p>
