 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 568 - Beneath The Round Moon</strong></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Chu Feng couldn’t help inhaling a breath of cool air. He said hiddenly in his heart, “Little Mei has grown. She was already impressive before, and now, she is even bigger. She’s simply comparable to her elder sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng was a man, and in a situation like that, he naturally had his reactions. Under his stomach, a “pillar to the heavens” arose, and it was quite imposing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, Chu Feng even felt a bit of shame. After all, Su Mei was pressed on his body, so she could certainly clearly feel his change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what he did not expect was that Su Mei truly seemed to be another person. She clearly sensed it, but she did not avoid it. Not only did she allow Chu Feng to stare at herself, there was even a hint of a blush on her face. She opened her pink lips and moved in to kiss Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Mei, what are you doing?” Yet, Chu Feng subconsciously evaded Su Mei’s fragrant kiss because he promised Su Rou, that he would not do the thing between a man and a woman with Su Mei before marriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But right in front of his eyes, Su Mei’s behavior was clearly off. If that continued, he would lose control over himself. At that time, he would commit an offense. He did not want to do the thing he promised not to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. I just like you. I really, really like you. I want to give you my everything, and to only you.” As Su Mei spoke, she suddenly stood, and in front of Chu Feng, took off her pink long skirt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Chu Feng instinctively gasped, his eyes roundly widened, and almost shot out two pillars of blood from his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, at that very instant, what appeared in front of him was doubtlessly a perfect body. White and delicate skin, protruding fronts and behinds, and in addition to Su Mei’s unique sweet face, and her blurry eye expression because of alcohol, it was simply irresistible by any man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, I not only like you, I love you. I am willing to do anything for you, and I am willing to give you everything. I will do anything you request me to do. I just can’t lose you. I am yours, and only yours. I can give you anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Su Mei leaped into his embrace again, causing Chu Feng to subconsciously hold her. But when he touched Su Mei again, the feeling he got from his hands was completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without the separation of clothing, Chu Feng’s palm truly touched Su Mei’s skin. The feeling of smoothness, warmth, and also some elasticity, was simply like a reignition of fire. It made the flames in Chu Feng’s heart thoroughly burn, and it filled his entire body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng spin around, and pressed his body onto Su Mei. He widened his mouth, and started to madly suck Su Mei’s body, as if he wanted to put all of Su Mei into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, his hands unrestrainedly went around everywhere. On Su Mei’s perfect body, he rubbed and scratched, acting very wildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh~~~” When Chu Feng was so rough, Su Mei did not know if it hurt or not, so she involuntarily moaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Su Mei’s soft voice was like adding oil on fire, making Chu Feng even wilder. He very barbarously ripped off his clothes, and prepared to make some love with the beauty beneath him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, what are you doing?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But just at that moment, a fierce voice rang out suddenly behind Chu Feng. It made both Su Mei and Chu Feng shocked. Looking towards the origin of the voice, their complexions couldn’t help changing further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because at present, Su Rou appeared within the house. She stood ten meters away from the bed, looking at Chu Feng and Su Mei with both a stunned and horrified expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, it was as though Chu Feng and Su Mei did some vile thing as they hurriedly, in panic, wore their respective clothes, and during that period of time, Su Rou stood in front of the bed with the same expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, do you remember what you promised me earlier? How can you do this?!” After waiting for Su Mei to wear her long skirt, Su Rou interrogated with an extremely strict tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister, this isn’t Chu Feng’s fault, I...” But before letting Chu Feng speak, Su Mei rushed to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Mei, leave. Return to your room. I have something I want to talk to Chu Feng alone.” But before letting Su Mei finish speaking, Su Rou gestured her to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Glancing at her elder sister, then looking at Chu Feng, Su Mei gnashed her teeth, pursed her lips, but ultimately, left with a shameful expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to say anything. I know that Little Mei went to find you. I’m her elder sister. How can I not understand her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She loves you. Loves you greatly. She wants to let you know how much she loves you, so she wished to give her everything to you before you leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, I know your feelings are sincere to both me and Little Mei, but please understand. I still hope you two can wait until after the marriage before doing this sort of thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After all, having something to look forward to when you return is better than having nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng initially wanted to say something, but Su Rou had a know-it-all appearance. Moreover, as she spoke, she walked up to Chu Feng, and did something that made Chu Feng stupefied. She actually slowly loosened her skirt in front of Chu Feng, and removed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Su Rou completely exhibited her mature and well-developed, hot and fair body, in front of Chu Feng, and even leaped into Chu Feng’s embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Rou, you are?!” Chu Feng panicked a bit. He understood Su Rou’s words, but did not understand why Su Rou would suddenly do all that because in his perspective, although Su Rou was already “owned” by him, she was still a bit against doing the thing between a man and a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, Little Mei loves you, but I also love you. Little Mei can give anything to you, and I similarly can give anything to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, please forgive me. Forgive my stubborness. I only have one sister, Little Mei, so I hope you can love her more than you love me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just wait a bit longer. Little Mei is sooner or later yours. We sisters are yours. But before that, she can’t do it with you, so let me take her place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Rou’s gentle tone kept on lingering next to Chu Feng’s ears, and her slender hands tore away the clothes Chu Feng wore just now, and started to trace along Chu Feng’s heated body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that situation, no man could continue enduring. Besides, Chu Feng was an impatient, “real” man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, his </span><i><span style>thing </span></i><span style>that he just controlled exploded again. Ignoring all, he pressed Su Rou underneath. However, this time, Chu Feng learnt his lesson. Before doing the deed, he laid a powerful Spirit Formation, sealing the entire house, preventing anyone from interrupting his good time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the bright round moon, in the room that overflowed with love, one manly and one soft body interweaved, creating an enviable beautiful scene.</span></p>
