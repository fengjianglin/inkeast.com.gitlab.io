 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although what Chu Feng said caused the crowd to feel even more uneasy, they had no choice but to follow him. After all, if even he was unable to exit the Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation, no one else among them would be capable of doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Chu Feng, he did not bother with superfluous words in attempting to explain his plan to the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason for that was because it was as Liangqiu Lanyue had said, getting through the maze would require one's intuition. To be exact, the Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation was ever-changing and unpredictable. Furthermore, its changes did not follow any pattern. If one wanted to pass through it, one would have to rely on one's own abilities as a world spiritist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was most definitely related to the strength of one's world spirit techniques. However, the strength of one's world spirit techniques was not the most important aspect in solving formations. What was most important would be the judgement of the world spiritist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Entering the first path, Chu Feng had only walked for a short while before he encountered a fork. He chose to take the path to the left. However, right after he took the path to the left, he was faced with another choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, the forks were not as simple as having only two choices. Instead, they each had some hints that a world spiritist would have to distinguish, examine and make a judgement upon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, because Chu Feng was focused on making a judgement as to which path to take, it made it so that he was very slow in making his choice, very slow in solving the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, it was actually not only Chu Feng and the others that were faced with the Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liangqiu Chengfeng and the other grand characters of the older generation were also met with the Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it remained that Liangqiu Chengfeng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, the people assisting him were also very powerful existences in their own right. As such, they traveled through the spirit formation at a very fast pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whilst Chu Feng and the others were still cautiously solving their Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation, the experts of the older generation, under Liangqiu Chengfeng's leadership, had entered the depths of the Ancient Era's remnant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Liangqiu Chengfeng was actually carried out from the Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation by the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief and the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief using a special spirit formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Liangqiu Chengfeng had a pale complexion. Layer upon layer of spirit power had enveloped his body. That spirit power resembled toxic gas, and was infiltrating his body and bringing an expression of pain upon his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, even with that being the case, Liangqiu Chengfeng was still observing his surroundings with a serious expression. In the end, his gaze was fixed on a spirit formation located deep within the palace hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That spirit formation emerged from the ground and connected to the roof of the palace hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it was completely transparent like glass. If one did not look closely, one would simply not be able to see its. That said, one could sense that it was a very powerful spirit formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surrounding that spirit formation were eight steles. Carved on each stele was a dragon. The eight dragons were completely different from one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what caught the crowd's eyes were not those dragons. Instead, it was what was inside the spirit formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an item inside the spirit formation. That item was floating in midair, and drifting up and down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The item was the size of a watermelon. It had a dark-green color, and light was circulating through its body. One could tell that it was extraordinary from a single glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, that item was actually moving about nonstop. It was as if it were alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at that item, Liangqiu Chengfeng spoke with a weak voice. "It would appear that it is the treasure of this place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lord Liangqiu, exactly what is that?" Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I do not know what it is either. However, one thing is certain: the item inside that spirit formation is not the only treasure here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Those things on the walls are also treasures," Liangqiu Chengfeng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people that had entered the palace hall were immediately captured by the item inside the spirit formation. It was only after hearing what Liangqiu Chengfeng said that the crowd noticed that the walls of the palace hall were shining with blue light akin to that of fireflies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Those are the treasures?" Someone asked curiously as he extended his hand to grab one such light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Clamor~~~"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the blue bodies of light all came loose from the walls. Like a massive group of bugs that had lost control, they began to fly about at random in that palace hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, a very dense amount of natural energy was emitted from those blue bodies of light. Everyone present was able to clearly sense those natural energies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Those are cultivation treasures, cultivation treasures!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon finding out that those bodies of light actually contained such natural energies, the crowd all began to use their various abilities to capture those flying insects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In merely the blink of an eye, all of the flying insects were captured by the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Practically everyone managed to capture those flying insects. The only difference was the amount of flying insects they'd captured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lord Liangqiu, are you alright?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when the crowd were basking in joy, a voice of panic sounded from the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking toward the voice, the crowd discovered that the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief and the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief were both before Liangqiu Chengfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liangqiu Chengfeng had been placed on the ground. However, at that moment, his eyes were closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is bad, it seems that Lord Liangqiu's injury is even worse than we imagined."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the crowd all arrived before Liangqiu Chengfeng. They were not merely surrounding him, they were also using their respective techniques to examine and provide treatment to his injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They all knew very well what had happened in the Twenty-three Dragon Caves Formation. Due to the Li Heavenly Clan's Supreme Elder Li Taiyi's carelessness in touching a trap, countless ferocious spirit formation beasts descended from the sky and began to pounce at the crowd to bite and tear them apart.</span></p>

Liangqiu Chengfeng was so weak that he could not even walk on his own. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been carried by the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief and the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief using spirit formations.</span></p>

They could only look on helplessly as that toxic gas continued to engulf him.</span></p>

Following that, a figure was shot flying from the crowd.</span></p>

His body was shivering. A single strike had injured his soul and turned him into someone who appeared to be on the verge of dying.</span></p>

He revealed a smile on his face and said indifferently, "I am merely eliminating future worries."</span></p>
