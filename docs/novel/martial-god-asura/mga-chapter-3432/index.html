 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong? What’s with that expression?” Gong Qing stared at Chu Feng with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing. My expression is very natural,” Chu Feng hurriedly adjusted himself and revealed a perfect smile of pretense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gong Qing looked at Chu Feng like she was looking at a fool and rolled her eyes. She said, “What about you? What’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young lady, regarding that… is it fine if I don’t mention it?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Is your name so unpleasant to hear that you don’t wish to mention it to others?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Names are all given by one’s parents, how could you fear someone laughing at your name?” Gong Qing looked at Chu Feng with contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Chu Feng did not wish to give his name was naturally because of Gong Qing’s older sister, Gong Mingyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng did not wish to reveal himself because he did not wish to have any connection with that Gong Mingyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after hearing what Gong Qing said, Chu Feng felt her words to be very reasonable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name Chu Feng was given to him by his parents. Although he didn’t know if it was his father or his mother that gave him the name, it was not at all a shameful name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the contrary, Chu Feng was very proud of his name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying went, one should be proud of one’s name and stand by one’s actions. That was precisely what it meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how many reasons there might be, one should not conceal one’s name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was even more so since it was merely a ridiculous wedding arrangement. Chu Feng merely did not wish to associate himself with it. It wasn’t like he was afraid of anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention an arranged marriage made in a joking manner, even if it were made seriously, no one would be able to stop Chu Feng should he wish to cancel the arrangement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of that, Chu Feng gained confidence. He straightened his chest and raised his head. Without hesitation, he said, “Chu Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Feng?” Sure enough, upon hearing the name Chu Feng, Gong Qing’s expression grew stiff. She began to ponder it. It was only after a long while that she said with a soft voice, “Why does that name sound so familiar?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Gong Qing evidently only felt Chu Feng’s name to be familiar-sounding, and did not possess a deep impression of it. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to not be able to recall who Chu Feng was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chu Feng, he merely smiled. He was not so bored as to call Gong Qing’s attention to who he was. He wouldn’t tell Gong Qing that he was her future brother-in-law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the spirit formations Chu Feng had taught Gong Qing were very complicated, they were actually quite simple to set up should one learn the secret to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng had also left the secret to his spirit formations in their outlines. Thus, Gong Qing did not have to be fully concentrated when setting them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Feng and Gong Qing chatted, Chu Feng learned about the hedgehog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gong Qing had no idea what sort of species the hedgehog was. It was something that she had encountered by chance at a mountain that had existed since the Ancient Era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gong Qing encountered the hedgehog, she was only a small child. Thus, it could be said that the hedgehog had grown up together with her, and as such, it was very important to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following the treatment method indicated by Chu Feng’s spirit formation, the seriously-ill hedgehog soon began to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that, Gong Qing began to wholeheartedly focus on healing the hedgehog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the semi-unconscious hedgehog regained full consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. My Lil’ Thorn actually really managed to…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gong Qing was overjoyed. She turned around and wanted to express her thanks to Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, upon turning around, she discovered that Chu Feng had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This guy… why would he leave already?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After verifying that Chu Feng had left, Gong Qing revealed an expression of regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chu Feng, he had verified that the hedgehog would be able to attain a full recovery when its situation changed for the better. As such, he decided to leave without saying good-bye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Chu Feng was so urgent to leave was because he had something that he must do. He must return to the Ice Summit. He planned to explain what had happened that day to Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that, in addition to his spirit power that was already sealed, his cultivation was also starting to be sealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power of the backlash was even more frightening than he had anticipated. In that sort of situation, his cultivation would, sooner or later, be completely sealed. At that time, he would become someone without cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng didn’t know why this was happening. As such, he wanted to ask Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was flying in the sky. However, he only flew for a short while before his attention was caught by a scene below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a group of people surrounding a single person. As for the person that was surrounded… it was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the people that had surrounded that Chu Heavenly Clansman, they were from another Heavenly Clan, the Xu Heavenly Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same Heavenly Clan that had clashed with Chu Feng on the way to the Ice Summit that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chu Heavenly Clansman that was being surrounded had the appearance of a middle-aged man. However, he should be more than a thousand years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, his cultivation was very unimpressive. At his age, his cultivation was only that of a rank one Heavenly Immortal. As for those Xu Heavenly Clansmen that had surrounded him, any one of them had a cultivation surpassing his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from the Xu Heavenly Clansmen and that Chu Heavenly Clansman, there were also a lot of people gathered in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those people were from all different powers. At that moment, they were watching everything like they were watching a show that was about to unfold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the ones below were from other Heavenly Clans, Chu Feng would not bother to pay attention at all. However, since it was a Chu Heavenly Clansman, Chu Feng would not watch and remain indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Chu Feng stopped in midair and looked downward. He wanted to see exactly what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, we possess neither grievances or hatred, why would you all suddenly attack me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, that middle-aged Chu Heavenly Clansman had received some light injuries. Fortunately, those injuries were not serious. However, faced with the situation he was in, he had a flustered expression on his face. It could be seen that he was very afraid.</span></p>
