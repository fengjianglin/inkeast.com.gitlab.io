 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 499 - The Current Chance</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Crippling Night Demon Sect?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the four bloody big words in the sky, the faces of the Zi family’s master, as well as Zi Ling’s parents and even Zi Ling’s grandfather, changed greatly. The fear in their eyes became extremely dense instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because all of them knew what the Crippling Night Demon Sect represented. It represented the number one Demon Sect in the Eastern Sea Region many years ago. So strong that not a single power could defeat it. Even if it was the current Immortal Execution Archipelago, they weren’t able to defeat the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Crippling Night Demon Sect of that year was like the sun at noon. Not to mention the unimaginably powerful head of the Demon Sect, even if it was only Four Protectors of the Demon Sect, all of them had strengths which were akin to those of the heads of other powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eastern Sea Region of that time was indeed the world of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Not a single power dared to fight against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until one day, the head of the Demon Sect suddenly passed away. For seizing the position of head, the Four Protectors killed one another, causing the Demon Sect to split in many pieces. The huge monster that was titled as the overlord of the Eastern Sea Region for several thousands of years finally gave up its position in the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, although the Crippling Night Demon Sect was already fragmented, everyone knew that the people of the Demon Sect were still people who the Eastern Sea Region feared the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Eastern Sea Region, no matter which power it was, no one was willing to easily offend the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect because those who did would certainly receive their insane revenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the current peak powers of the Eastern Sea Region weren’t willing to anger the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect because the Four Protectors of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, who were still living healthily, were still extremely terrifying existences. Luckily they opposed one another, or else, if they joined hands, even if it was the Immortal Execution Archipelago that was becoming more and more powerful by the day, they were not necessarily able to defeat them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And since the black-clothed old man in front of them actually had such terrifying strength, clearly, he was not an ordinary person within the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Before, they were even so disrespectful, so how could they not be afraid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>*poof* Suddenly, the master of the Zi family half-knelt in the air, kowtowed to the black-clothed old man with his hands together held in front of him, and endlessly admitted his faults, “It was me who had sockets but no eyes! Senior, I didn’t know you were a part of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! I ask, as you are a great character, please have great benevolence and forgive my family!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, have mercy. Senior, have mercy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zi Ling’s parents also half-knelt in the sky and both asked for forgiveness from the black-clothed old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing such parents and the so-called family master, Zi Ling lightly frowned and a hint of disdain flashed into her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never would have thought that as Martial Lords, they didn’t have any courage. In front of a weak person, they acted as if they were invincible and did everything decisively, but in front of a powerful person, they actually kowtowed. Even if people like them had strength, they were fated to have&nbsp;achievements that weren't too great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had to be said that at that very instant, Zi Ling, who already had an extremely poor impression on the Zi family, had an even worse impression now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph. Garbage is garbage. In your life, you will always be garbage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. You aren’t even qualified to die by my hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But. Seeing several dogs like you who are blindly loyal to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, I can’t help but tell you this. Don’t think that the Immortal Execution Archipelago is truly invincible in this world since its might is shocking the eastern sea right now. There are plenty of people who can take care of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scram. Speaking to trash like you is simply a waste of my breath and lowering who I am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-clothed old man coldly snorted, then the world changed. Very quickly, the ocean of blood disappeared, the corpses and bones could not be seen, and the endless night became the clear sky for a ten thousand miles again. Coincident with that, the black-clothed old man also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Family master, the old man just now…his strength is really too terrifying. Is it possible that the Inferno&nbsp;Divine Bird was killed by him? Is it possible that he is...” After Zi Ling’s father rose, he asked with a face filled with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And after the master of the Zi family stood back up, he did not reply. He first wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead, then said to Zi Ling’s mother, “Quick. Quickly leave this place, quickly return to the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng did not know about the scene that the Zi family just experienced. At that moment, he was standing on the top of the Void Tower, looking towards the direction that Zi Ling and the others disappeared at. His heart was extremely complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t understand too much about the Immortal Execution Archipelago, but as long as he recalled that it was the strongest force in the Eastern Sea Region, and even the Zi family members, who had the cultivations of Martial Lords, had to be respectful towards it, Chu Feng could more or less understand the power of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time of four years was too short. If he truly had to confront the enormous power four years later, his chances of victory could be said to be extremely distant. But no matter what, he would do his best to raise his strength. Even if there was just the tiniest bit of hope, he had to grab onto the little hope and not let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, are you okay?” Suddenly, Zhang Tianyi’s voice rang out behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning his head to look, he saw Zhang Tianyi, Qi Fengyang, Jiang Hengyuan, the Monstrous Monkey King and the others flying over. In a blink, they landed on the Void Tower and worriedly asked Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing their questioning, Chu Feng did not hide anything and said everything in detail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They, who knew the truth, all started to comfort Chu Feng. They tried to make Chu Feng forget about Zi Ling because they felt that facing such enormousness, Chu Feng had almost no hope. Rather than constantly thinking about Zi Ling, why not put away the thoughts? After all, short pain is better than long pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But to the crowd’s words, Chu Feng only lightly smiled and did not reply. He knew that those people were doing all that for him, however, his decision was already set and it was absolutely not going to change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because he knew that with Zi Ling’s character, she would definitely do what she said. So, four years later, no matter what, he had to go over. Even if he at that time was still as weak as an ant, and going there was equal to sending himself to death, he had to go because he could not allow Zi Ling to die alone for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, although the future was vague, at the bottom of Chu Feng’s heart, there was indeed a trace of hope. It was for no other reason but because of the Divine Lightning in his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Divine Lightning’s appetite was very big, so big that it filled Chu Feng with suffering, as long as he had enough cultivation resources, the Divine Lightning could allow Chu Feng’s cultivation to explosively rise within a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At present, the Emperor Tomb was one chance. If there were things like an Essence Pool and Ice and Fire Pearls outside of the Emperor Tomb, then perhaps within it, there would be some treasures. Possibly even cultivation oddities that Chu Feng didn’t know about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few days of time, the emperor of the Jiang Dynasty finally came to the Azure Province and arrived at the Void School. However, accompanying the arrival of the emperor were many experts from the Jiang Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the same as Jiang Hengyuan, having the cultivation of the 7th level of the Heaven realm. They actually had no less than nine people with that cultivation. It was the same cultivation as the old ancestor of the World Spirit Guild, the genius whose name spread throughout the Nine Provinces a hundred years ago, Gu Tianchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that, it could be seen that the Jiang Dynasty was indeed very powerful. At least in the continent of the Nine Provinces, they were invincible.</span></p>
