 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 299 - Ancient Castle Exploration</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing those words, Chu Feng couldn’t help but be taken aback. He never would have thought that it was able to feel the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique that was in his body.</p>
 <p>“Haha, you don’t need to worry. I won’t be as proud as that guy. I don’t mind recognize the same master, but if you want to receive my ability, I still need to test your courage.” The Black Tortoise Armor Technique said.</p>
 <p>“Test in what way?” Chu Feng quickly asked.</p>
 <p>“Follow this place and go straight forward. There is an ancient stone castle there. Deep within the stone castle, there is a box that is sealed. Bring that box to me, then I’ll pass my ability down to you.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, it won’t be that easy if you want to take that box. You have a ten hours limit. If you can’t do it, that can only mean that you and I aren’t fated for one another. Hahaha...”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Black Tortoise Armor Technique strangely laughed loudly, and as he laughed, the fog that surrounded Chu Feng also backed away. When the fog completely disappeared, Chu Feng also returned to the vast cave world. However, the Black Tortoise Armor Technique already disappeared and could not be seen.</p>
 <p>“Senior, is there something protecting it? Or does that mean that there is some mechanism?” Chu Feng quickly and loudly asked, but it was useless as after the Black Tortoise Armor Technique left, it did not return. It was as if it completely disappeared and it did not leave a single trace.</p>
 <p>At that instant, Chu Feng couldn’t help but cast his gaze towards the direction that the Black Tortoise Armor Technique said to go towards. There was a tunnel made out of the cave rocks. It was quite similar to the tunnels at the Emperor Tomb entrance underneath the Vermilion Bird City.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not hesitate as he took out the World Spirit Compass again and walked forward. He was truly powerless towards the attraction of a Secret Skill.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I feel like that Secret Skill is tricking you.” But just at that time Eggy solemnly reminded.</p>
 <p>“Eggy, what do you mean?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I feel like that Secret Skill is cunning. It would not pass its ability down to you in such a simple manner. Putting aside that the thing it told you to get is very difficult to obtain, even if you got it, it would not necessarily recognize you as its master. Perhaps it would even consume you.” Eggy reminded.</p>
 <p>“Really? What benefits does it gain from using me like that?” Chu Feng was a bit confused.</p>
 <p>“That’s simple. The reason why it is staying here is very likely because it is stuck here. The thing that it wants you to take can possibly be the thing that can recover its freedom.”</p>
 <p>“You need to know that Secret Skills are very prideful. Unless it is an extremely powerful person, they would not be willing to submit. So, that causes some Secret Skills to not choose another master after it left its first master.”</p>
 <p>“So, with a body of freedom, it wanders around the world. Unless it meets a super strong expert who forces them into submission, they will not serve any other person.”</p>
 <p>“The Secret Skill just now said it was different than the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique. It intentionally said that it was not proud, but that causes it to be more suspicious in concealing its pride. All in all, I feel that it will not easily serve you, and rather, it seems to be using you.” Eggy explained.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, the good things that is in range of touching will always cause people to doubt. However, right now, I don’t even have another choice. Besides, what I’m currently afraid of is that the box it wants me to take won’t be so easily taken.” Chu Feng already walked into the huge cave tunnel. In front of him, densely packed huge symbols also appeared.</p>
 <p>“These are Anti-Demon Symbols! Is it possible that there is also an Evil Spirit here guarding?” At that instant, even Eggy could not remain calm. Anti-Demon Symbols were used to restrict Evil Spirits, and those who were able to become Evil Spirits required at least the cultivation of the Heaven realm. It was not something that Chu Feng could fight against.</p>
 <p>“It seems like the Black Tortoise Armor Technique has really given me a difficult task.” Chu Feng bitterly chuckled and he couldn’t avoid becoming more careful. However, he did not stop his steps forward as he did not want to waste the time of ten hours.</p>
 <p>After two hours of hurrying, the cave tunnel also started to become huge and the Anti-Demon Symbols also gathered more closely. Which also meant that Chu Feng was getting closer and closer to that Evil Spirit.</p>
 <p>Finally, after two more hours of walking, the Anti-Demon Symbols disappeared and a huge old castle appeared in front of Chu Feng. The old castle’s shape was like a human skull. It was sinister and scary, and it gave people an extremely eerie feeling.</p>
 <p>In order to not attract attention, Chu Feng had no choice but to put away the World Spirit Compass and to conceal his aura. Carefully, he went into the entrance that was like a mouth.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, listen to me. With your current strength, if you meet an Evil Spirit, you will, without a doubt, die. Evil Spirits grasp the power of Spirit Formations, and despite having no Spirit power, if it locks onto you, escape is pretty much impossible.”</p>
 <p>“So, if you meet an Evil Spirit, you must let me control your body or else both you and I will die by the Evil Spirit’s mouth. If consumed by it, not only you, even I will certainly die. We will be absorbed and refined like Source energy and we will disappear completely and thoroughly.” Eggy gravely reminded.</p>
 <p>“Mm.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng nodded his head. He had seen an Evil Spirit before and he knew the scariness of things like them. It was exactly as how Eggy said it was. They were not something that he could fight against. These were not times to fake strength, so when the time came, he would do what he needed to do.</p>
 <p>He would allow Eggy to control his body. Even if Eggy would receive a huge burden, as long as they could survive, at least he had methods to help Eggy recover. But if they were dead, it meant that they had nothing.</p>
 <p>After the decision, Chu Feng continued deeper into the ancient castle. The deeper he went, the more Chu Feng felt disturbed. He astonishedly discovered that there was only a single tunnel in the ancient castle. To avoid being discovered by the Evil Spirit, Chu Feng did not dare to use his Spirit power for detection.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was forced into being passive under those situations. But he had no choice. He could only continue straight forward, and finally, Chu Feng reached the end. At the end, a vast main hall appeared in front of Chu Feng’s face.</p>
 <p>The style of the main hall could be described with one word: Strange. Uneasiness seeped everywhere as if a terrifying Evil Spirit could appear in front of Chu Feng at any time.</p>
 <p>But Chu Feng did not have time to think about those things because his current gaze was already attracted to a huge chair at the end since there was an odd box on the chair.</p>
 <p>The box was very big and its shape was very strange. It seemed quite like a coffin, but that coffin had thousands of holes and it was ten times the size of normal coffins.</p>
 <p>“Dammit. There’s a Spirit Formation on this chair.” Seeing that the Evil Spirit was not inside of the ancient castle, Chu Feng quickly arrived in front of the huge chair. But he discovered that outside of the chair, there was a very impressive layer of protective Spirit Formation laid.</p>
 <p>“Don’t panic. With the Spirit Formation techniques that you currently grasp, you should be able to decipher it. But no one knows when the Evil Spirit will return so you need to be quick.” Eggy reminded.</p>
 <p>“Mm, I can only do that.” Chu Feng gnashed his teeth. To gain the Secret Skill, Chu Feng could only risk the danger of being caught by the Evil Spirit at any time to decipher the Spirit Formation on the huge chair.</p>
 <p>However, the more he deciphered, the more Chu Feng felt troubled. He felt that there was a pair of eyes staring behind his back, yet when he turned around to look, there was clearly nothing there.</p>
