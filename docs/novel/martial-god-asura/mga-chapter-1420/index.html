 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1420 - Mysterious Formation</strong></p>
 <p>At a single glance, Chu Feng was able to tell that this invitation letter was from the Cyanwood Mountain. Not only was the special symbol of the Cyanwood Mountain on the invitation letter, it also contained a special sort of aura.</p>
 <p>This sort of aura was unique to the Cyanwood Mountain. It could only be created by a special treasure in the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>Thus, it was very difficult for others to forge the Cyanwood Mountain’s special aura. Thus, as long as one received letters containing this sort of aura, it was most definitely from the Cyanwood Mountain because that was the forgery protection method that the Cyanwood Mountain used.</p>
 <p>After receiving the invitation letter from Sima Ying, Chu Feng opened the letter to view the contents. Once he saw the contents, a strong smile instantly appeared on Chu Feng’s face, and he became extremely excited.</p>
 <p>Not only did the invitation letter explicitly state the invitation of the World Spiritist Alliance’s disciples to participate in the Nine Powers Hunt, it even stated the venue for the Nine Powers Hunt this time around: the Cyanwood Mountain’s forbidden area, the place that Chu Feng wanted to enter the most, the Ancient Era’s Remnants.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, “Lil Sis Ying’er, could it be that for this Nine Powers Hunt, not only will you be going, Lin Yezhou will also be going, and even the disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect, Golden Armor City and the other Nine Powers will all be present?”</p>
 <p>Although the opening of the Ancient Era’s Remnants was the most important matter to him, he was also very concerned about the question he had just asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, of course that’s true. If there’s no unforeseen event, then not only will the outstanding disciples of the Nine Powers receive the invitation, even some of the powers who possess a certain amount of strength but are weaker than the Nine Powers will also receive the invitation.”</p>
 <p>“After all, this Nine Powers Hunt is not merely a competition between the disciples of the Nine Powers, it is also a great opportunity to display the strength of the Nine Powers to other powers.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, practically every Nine Powers Hunt is not limited to only the Nine Powers. There will always be a lot of other powers either spectating or joining the competition,” Sima Ying explained.</p>
 <p>“Great, this is truly a great opportunity that comes only once in a blue moon,” Hearing what Sima Ying said, the smile on Chu Feng’s face grew even denser.</p>
 <p>Actually, Chu Feng did not care about whether other people or other powers would participate in the Nine Powers Hunt.</p>
 <p>However, upon thinking that Lin Yezhou, Qin Lingyun and the disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect would all appear, Chu Feng felt as if his entire body’s blood was boiling. After all, he possessed deep grievances toward these people.</p>
 <p>After calculating the time, Chu Feng determined that it would still be a while before the Nine Powers Hunt started. If Chu Feng were able to increase his cultivation by one level in this period of time, he would be able to contend against Qin Lingyun, Lin Yezhou and the others. Perhaps he might be able to avenge the hatred he had toward them.</p>
 <p>If his luck was good, then Chu Feng would be able to find out where Han Helai was and retrieve the Sealing Glacier from him. Then, he could help Hong Qiang seal that Natural Oddity and thereby obtain valuable cultivation resources.</p>
 <p>In that case, it would not be as simple as an increase in only a single level of cultivation for him. At that time, the humiliation that he had received from those people would all be returned. Before all those people, Chu Feng would let them know what sort of end comes to those who humiliate him.</p>
 <p>As such, how could Chu Feng not be excited? He was practically fired up just thinking about it.</p>
 <p>“I can tell that you are deeply looking forward to this Nine Powers Hunt. To be honest, I am also looking forward to it. Back in the Cyanwood Mountain, those bastards treated me like that. I shall see who among them dares to act disrespectful towards me when I return to the Cyanwood Mountain this time around,” Sima Ying said with an expression of anticipation.</p>
 <p>It was apparent that this girl, Sima Ying, was also someone who remembered grudges. She was waiting for an opportunity to retrieve her lost face. It was clear that she had also determined this Nine Powers Hunt to be that opportunity.</p>
 <p>“The Nine Powers Hunt is about to begin? Oh, that would truly be a good thing. It has been a very long time since I’ve seen those old friends of mine.”</p>
 <p>“However, what we need to do right now is proceed for the Sealing Ancient Village. After all, we must capture that traitor, that animal who slaughtered his own comrades, Han Helai as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an old man’s voice sounded. Following that, a figure appeared before everyone. It was none other than Miao Renlong.</p>
 <p>“Grandpa Miao, you’ve returned?” Seeing Miao Renlong’s return, Sima Ying was overjoyed. Immediately, she asked him, “In that case, when are we going to the Sealing Ancient Village?”</p>
 <p>“We’ll be leaving immediately,” Miao Renlong said with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, not only was Sima Ying overjoyed, even Chu Feng was overjoyed. Truly what he wanted had come right away. This journey to the Sealing Ancient Village would be crucial in determining whether or not he could demonstrate his extraordinary talent in the Nine Powers Hunt and seize the treasures.</p>
 <p>After this matter was determined, the three of them set off right away. Under Miao Renlong’s guidance, Chu Feng finally returned to the Sealing Ancient Village.</p>
 <p>The Sealing Ancient Village was the same as it always had been. However, the return of Miao Renlong and Chu Feng caused Old Village Chief Ma to be extremely happy.</p>
 <p>One must know that Old Village Chief Ma had been waiting for Chu Feng’s news the entire time. However, he never expected for Chu Feng to bring back a grand character like Miao Renlong.</p>
 <p>Especially after they took out the treasure that contained Han Helai’s aura to compare with the aura Old Village Chief Ma possessed, Old Village Chief Ma became immensely overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“It’s him. There’s no mistake. This aura is definitely the same. I never would’ve expected that the person who had come to our Sealing Ancient Village and stolen our Sealing Glacier would be the World Spiritist Alliance’s traitor.”</p>
 <p>“If Lord Miao is willing to provide assistance, this scoundrel by the name of Han Helai will definitely not be able to escape,” Old Village Chief Ma said with great joy. The implication behind his words was that he wished for Miao Renlong to be able to help him.</p>
 <p>“Han Helai is our World Spiritist Alliance’s traitor. If we can find his trace, I will naturally not let him get away. However, this will require us to know his whereabouts,” Miao Renlong said.</p>
 <p>“Lord Miao, please rest assured. This formation from our Sealing Ancient Village is definitely deserving of its reputation,” In response, Old Village Chief Ma smiled lightly. After that, he arrived before a formation.</p>
 <p>When they saw that formation, the gazes of Chu Feng, Miao Renlong and Sima Ying all turned serious.</p>
 <p>They all wished to know exactly what sort of formation that was for it to possess the miraculous power of being able to track a person down by their aura.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, there was nothing special about the formation that appeared before Chu Feng. At the very least, when judging it by its appearance, it was very ordinary.</p>
 <p>It was merely a stone platform. The stone platform was not very large. It was a circular stone platform that was three meters tall and two meters in diameter.</p>
 <p>Other than some special runes and symbols that were carved on the stone platform, it could be said that there was nothing special about this rock platform. It it wasn’t for the runes and symbols on it, Chu Feng and the rest would truly never imagine this rock platform to be a formation.</p>
 <p>However, the runes and symbols on the rock platform were very ordinary too. Even when using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was unable to tell what was special about this rock platform.</p>
 <p>“Could this be the formation you’re talking about?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Sima Ying looked to Chu Feng with a gaze filled with suspicion. It seemed that she was unconvinced that this formation possessed the sort of miraculous ability Chu Feng had previously described.</p>
 <p>“Young lady, do not be anxious. You will soon know how extraordinary this formation is.”</p>
 <p>“Although this is the first time that I’ve activated this formation, the records of our Sealing Ancient Village list that this formation has been activated three times now. Furthermore, it was a success every single time,” Old Village Chief Ma said with great confidence.</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he retrieved Han Helai’s aura from the treasure and placed it into the formation.</p>
 <p>“Buzz.”</p>
 <p>After Han Helai’s aura was placed into the formation, that ordinary formation began to shine with light. Especially those ordinary-looking runes and symbols, they were actually no longer ordinary. Instead, they became simply unfathomable.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, with this sort of change, a mysterious and powerful aura started to emit from that formation. It soon covered Chu Feng and the others.</p>
 <p>That aura was truly too powerful. It was simply something that they had never encountered before. Even Miao Renlong was displaying an expression of shock. That was because that aura felt as if it was from the Ancient Era.</p>
