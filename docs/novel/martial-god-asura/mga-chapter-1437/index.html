 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1437 - The Final Seal</strong></p>
 <p>Hong Qiang was stunned. He had realized the amazing aspect of the Sealing Sword the moment he had laid eyes on it.</p>
 <p>After a moment of shock, he looked to Chu Feng with a whole new level of respect.</p>
 <p>Even though he did not know where Chu Feng had obtained this sword, he knew that this sword would be able to help him greatly.</p>
 <p>“Pow~~~”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Hong Qiang did not hesitate or speak any superfluous words. He raised his hand and caught the Sealing Sword that Chu Feng threw to him. When his hand came in contact with the Sealing Sword, Hong Qiang felt the power of the Sealing Sword through his own body and exposed a smile on his face. It was a smile of confidence.</p>
 <p>“Aoouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this time, another strange roar sounded from the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower. It was unleashing another attack. This time around, it was not as simple as being only flames. It actually shot forth a countless amount of thick and solid flower vines from within its body.</p>
 <p>The flower vines were filled with thistles and thorns. Furthermore, they were abnormally large. Each and every one of them was like a long, twisted python with flames all over its body. With a very intense killing intent, they surged forward toward Chu Feng and Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>However, before such an attack, Hong Qiang did not put it in his eyes at all. Holding the Sealing Sword in his hand, he sliced through all of the incoming flower vines and charged toward the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower. In the end, he arrived before the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p>
 <p>“Courting… death!!!”</p>
 <p>After Hong Qiang drew close, that Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower actually uttered human speech. Even though its voice sounded very unclear, it was filled with coldness. From this, it could be seen that it hated Hong Qiang to the bone.</p>
 <p>“I’ve come to court death. If you have the ability, then try killing me.”</p>
 <p>Hong Qiang laughed lightly. His mouth was raised into a curve, and an expression of calmness appeared on his face. It was as if he had already seen through life and death. To him, death was not something frightening.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Hong Qiang’s footsteps changed. Numerous energy ripples began to appear with his every step. As his martial power permeated into the surrounding area, he had unleashed a Taboo Martial Skill and turned into a ray of light. Like a sharp arrow, he shot toward the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~~”</p>
 <p>The Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower unleashed a snarl once again. All of a sudden, its entire body was covered with multiple layers of frightening flames. With a great amount of brightness, the flames violently surged from its body like an enormous volcanic explosion.</p>
 <p>However, the might of its attack was not something that a volcanic eruption could possibly compare with. Those flames were simply capable of devouring everything in their path, capable of drowning all living things to death.</p>
 <p>As for Hong Qiang, he was naturally also drowned by the flames and his figure could no longer be seen. However, the most frightening aspect was most definitely not this. Instead, it was that the waves of flames capable of toppling the mountains and overturning the seas were currently surging toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At such close distance, Chu Feng was able to sense that these waves of flames were many times more frightening than the ones from before. This time around, the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower had unleashed its true power.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that I, Chu Feng, am to die in this place?”</p>
 <p>As he saw the extremely frightening flames rushing toward him with an unbelievable speed, Chu Feng felt fear.</p>
 <p>“No, I believe in senior Hong Qiang. He will definitely be able to triumph.”</p>
 <p>However, even though this was the case, Chu Feng did not choose to escape. In fact, he did not even blink his eyes before the flames. Just like that, he watched as the overflowing, raging flames surged toward him.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not escape. After all, there was no way for him to escape. And most importantly, he believed in Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Hong Qiang had decided to attack, Chu Feng had seen an unprecedented amount of confidence in Hong Qiang’s expression. That sort of confident expression caused Chu Feng to firmly believe that Hong Qiang would definitely be able to defeat the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p>
 <p>Even though the current situation left them in imminent danger, Chu Feng still firmly believed in Hong Qiang. Even if he were to use his life as the gambling stake, he still firmly believed in Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>“Roaarrr~~~~”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, at the time when the surging wave of raging flames was less than a hundred meters away from Chu Feng, at the time when the heat of the flames was already melting Chu Feng’s skin, a heart-tearing and lung-splitting scream sounded from the depths of that sea of flames.</p>
 <p>It was the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower’s voice. Not only that, at the moment the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower screamed, the waves of raging flames that were about to reach Chu Feng suddenly stopped moving forward, as if they were frozen.</p>
 <p>This sort of state only lasted for a split second before the raging flames started to rush backward.</p>
 <p>The sea of flames that was about to cover the entire cave suddenly started to rush backwards. It must be said that this scene was considerably spectacular.</p>
 <p>After the sea of flames completely disappeared, the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower and Hong Qiang’s figures once again appeared before Chu Feng’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>At this time, Chu Feng was able to clearly see that Hong Qiang had returned to his original size. Before the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower, his current size could be said to be extremely small.</p>
 <p>However, it was precisely that small figure who had saved Chu Feng. Surrounding Hong Qiang was a vortex-like formation. This formation possessed a very powerful attractive force. It was precisely this formation that had completely absorbed all of the flames, saving Chu Feng in the process.</p>
 <p>As for the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower, although its body was still enormous, the flames that covered its body had dimmed considerably. Furthermore, its aura had also greatly decreased.</p>
 <p>“Good sword,” Right at this moment, Hong Qiang slowly spoke those words with a complacent smile on his face.</p>
 <p>After hearing those words, Chu Feng discovered that the Sealing Sword was pierced into the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower’s body. Furthermore, the reason why the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower was so weak was all because of the Sealing Sword.</p>
 <p>The Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower suddenly looked to Chu Feng and spoke with a vicious tone filled with hatred. “Damned brat, you deserve to die!”</p>
 <p>“It’s you who gave him that sword!”</p>
 <p>“However, don’t you feel complacent. I know what you desire, I know why you’ve come here.”</p>
 <p>“I will not allow you have your way. Even if I am to die, I will not let you get the thing that you want. You are destined to have come here in vain.”</p>
 <p>After it finished saying those things, its body started to rapidly decrease in size, and a very strange power started to form within its body.</p>
 <p>“Senior, he’s trying to destroy the lotus seed.” Chu Feng discovered that the situation was bad and immediately called out to get Hong Qiang’s attention. After all, only Hong Qiang was capable of stopping the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, with me here, it will not succeed,” As a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, Hong Qiang had naturally also realized the change that was occurring to the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p>
 <p>Thus, at the moment when Chu Feng had called out for his attention, Hong Qiang was already rapidly forming hand seals with his hands. In no time, he had set up a special spirit formation. At the time when his hands were spread open, that spirit formation covered the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower’s body.</p>
 <p>That spirit formation was extremely powerful. It was not a sealing formation. Instead, it was a slaughtering formation. Hong Qiang was killing the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p>
 <p>“Roarr~~~~”</p>
 <p>“Damned humans! I curse you all to die miserable deaths!”</p>
 <p>The Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower let out its final snarl. Even though its body was still growing smaller in size, its aura was gone. Its life had already disappeared from its body. It had truly died. It had been killed by Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>The only thing that remained was its very valuable carcass, the thing that Hong Qiang yearned for even in his dreams, the Raging Flames Metal.</p>
 <p>Finally, the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower stopped shrinking. To be exact, it was the Raging Flames Metal that had stopped shrinking.</p>
 <p>“This is the Raging Flames Metal?” Chu Feng walked toward the Raging Flames Metal and discovered that it was completely different from the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower. It no longer gave off a vicious, evil air and instead gave off a solid-like sensation.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. After all these years, I’ve finally obtained it.”</p>
 <p>“However, at the crucial moment, the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower tried to use all of its power to destroy its seed.”</p>
 <p>“Even though I put forth all my effort to stop it, the lotus seed was still sealed by it,” Hong Qiang opened the Raging Flames Metal and a seed appeared.</p>
 <p>This seed was burning with raging flames. It contained an extremely intense amount of natural energy. Unfortunately, it was as Hong Qiang said, the seed had been sealed.</p>
 <p>If the seal was unable to be undone, even Chu Feng would not be able to refine it.</p>
