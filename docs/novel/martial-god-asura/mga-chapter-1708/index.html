 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1708 - Ximen Feixue</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior Jiang, it’s really you!!!”</p>
 <p>The voice Chu Feng heard was Jiang Furong’s voice.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, upon looking toward the voice, he saw Jiang Furong. Not only her, but the other outstanding disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain, Bai Yunxiao, Qi Yanyu, Tao Xiangyu, Ben Leihu and Zhao Jingang, were also present.</p>
 <p>Merely, at this moment, Jiang Furong was being blocked by a group of people. They were people from the Ximen Imperial Clan. Not only had they completely surrounded Jiang Furong, there was also an old man standing before her. This old man had a very ferocious appearance, and was actually a Martial Emperor. The person who had angrily shouted at Jiang Furong was also him.</p>
 <p>Behind this group of people from the Ximen Imperial Clan was a large war chariot. Hearing the discussion from the crowd, Chu Feng came to know that Jiang Furong was being stopped by this group of people from the Ximen Imperial Clan because she had accidently run into the war chariot.</p>
 <p>Normally, this would be something small. However, the people from the Ximen Imperial Clan were unwilling to overlook this matter. They had the attitude of wanting an apology, a compensation.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, Bai Yunxiao and the others were all deeply frightened. One by one, they stood to the side and did not even dare to speak. They were deeply afraid that they would be implicated by Jiang Furong.</p>
 <p>After all, the other party was the well-known Ximen Imperial Clan. Furthermore, there was a Martial Emperor-level expert among them.</p>
 <p>“Senior, we are disciples from the Cyanwood Mountain. We have come here by the invitation of the Mooncloud City. We martial siblings are preparing to participate in the Nine Powers’ disciples’ competition. Now that the competition has started, if we do not hurry over, I fear that we will be late.”</p>
 <p>“Let alone, senior sister Jiang did not do that on purpose. Senior, might you be willing to be a person of great moral status, and not mind the offenses committed by one of low moral stature and let senior sister Jiang go?”</p>
 <p>To Chu Feng’s surprise, after Bai Yunxiao hesitated for a while, he actually spoke out. Not only did he speak, he was even pleading for Jiang Furong.</p>
 <p>Even though Bai Yunxiao was trembling with fear as he said those words, he had at least spoken out against what was happening. This was truly a surprise to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng remembered that Bai Yunxiao and the others didn’t seem to get along with Jiang Furong. In the Cyanwood Mountain, they could be said to be enemies of one another.</p>
 <p>Logically, with Bai Yunxiao’s temperament, he should have not done anything in this sort of situation, and instead been rejoicing from Jiang Furong’s misfortune.</p>
 <p>Yet, he had actually decided to brave danger and plead for Jiang Furong. From this, it could be seen that Bai Yunxiao wasn’t as bad as Chu Feng had imagined him to be.</p>
 <p>“Not on purpose? You think you can settle this with a mere ‘not on purpose?’”</p>
 <p>“I do not care whose disciples you all are. The fact that you dared to run into our clan’s Fifth Prince is akin to asking for death. If you all do not wish to die, then scram right now instead of being a hindrance.”</p>
 <p>Even though that old man was a Martial Emperor, he simply did not possess a Martial Emperor’s demeanor. He spoke with profanity right after opening his mouth, just like a scoundrel.</p>
 <p>“Senior Bai, there’s not enough time, we should take our leave first,” Seeing that this Martial Emperor was enraged, Tao Xiangyu and the others who were deeply afraid to begin with hurriedly urged Bai Yunxiao to leave.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Yunxiao did not dare to stay anymore, and immediately left with Tao Xiangyu and the others. Only Jiang Furong remained.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I truly did not do that on purpose. Senior, would it do if I apologize to you?” Jiang Furong said with a low and petty appearance.</p>
 <p>She had come here from far away, and did not wish to miss this opportunity to compete against the other members of the younger generation from the Nine Powers.</p>
 <p>“Apologize? If an apology is useful, then wouldn’t it mean that it would not be a crime to kill someone?” That old man was unwilling to forgive and acted extremely arrogantly.</p>
 <p>Faced with how the old man was deliberately making things difficult for her, Jiang Furong’s face grew very ugly. She did not know what to do. After all, the person before her was a Martial Emperor. Speaking of it bluntly, she, as a mere Martial King, was not even qualified to contend against that old man.</p>
 <p>“Yoho, what arrogance,” Right at the moment when Jiang Furong didn’t know what to do, a figure suddenly walked out from the crowd and arrived before her. This person was none other than Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had currently disguised himself. Not to mention strangers that didn’t know him, even Jiang Furong didn’t recognize him.</p>
 <p>Needless to say, Chu Feng’s appearance was a surprise to everyone. None of them expected for there to be someone with the courage to challenge the Ximen Imperial Clan. Furthermore, this person was a young man.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? Are you planning to meddle in my business?”</p>
 <p>The eyebrows of the old man from the Ximen Imperial Clan narrowed, and he revealed a cold glint in his gaze. In fact, he had even faintly revealed his oppressive might. He was evidently trying to scare Chu Feng away, telling him to beat it.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was not afraid. Instead, with a slight smile, he said, “It’s not important who I am. What’s important is… who you all are.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?” The old man asked. He faintly realized that this boy before him seemed to be different from the others.</p>
 <p>“Ximen Imperial Clan, one of the Four Great Imperial Clans in the Holy Land of Martialism. It is said to be one of the clans that possessed the most noble bloodline in the Holy Land of Martialism.”</p>
 <p>“However, I truly never expected for such a noble clan to actually do such a disgraceful thing.”</p>
 <p>“Firstly, we’ll not talk about how this place is where the Holy Land of Martialism’s younger generation competes. I do not know why your Ximen Imperial Clan would come here.”</p>
 <p>“Secondly, we’ll also not talk about how there are this many people here. Yet, you all decided to bring a war chariot to push your way through.”</p>
 <p>“However, merely by the fact that this young lady here had only accidently touched your war chariot, you all immediately started to pester her endlessly, and refused to let her leave.”</p>
 <p>“Tell me, are your actions any different from those of an evil tyrant? Is this really something that a grand Imperial Clan should do?”</p>
 <p>“You…” Hearing those words, that old man’s complexion immediately turned pale. He was deeply angered. He had really never expected that a mere brat would dare to provoke him and publicly insult their Ximen Imperial Clan in such a manner.</p>
 <p>“You what? What I said earlier was about your Ximen Imperial Clan’s conduct. What I’m going to say now is about your conduct.”</p>
 <p>“I do not know who you are. However, no matter what, you are still a Martial Emperor. You are one of the top martial experts in the Holy Land of Martialism. Yet, you utterly lack the grace of a senior. For such a trivial matter, you decided to deliberately make things difficult for one of the younger generation. You are truly a disgrace to Martial Emperors,” Chu Feng continued. Not only was he pointing his finger at that old man, his saliva was also splattering all over that old man’s face.</p>
 <p>“You are courting death!” The old man wiped the saliva off his face and smelled the smell on his hand. He had become completely enraged.[1.yep, he smelled it.]</p>
 <p>Not only had Chu Feng publicly contradicted him, he had actually even insulted him in such a manner. He was truly incapable of enduring this.</p>
 <p>“Courting death? Very well. Go ahead, beat me to death. Let everyone know how much of a scoundrel your Ximen Imperial Clan is. Let everyone know how much of a scoundrel you are.”</p>
 <p>“Let everyone know what it means by taking advantage of one’s position to bully others, what is meant by bullying the weak,” Chu Feng placed both hands behind his back and raised his neck. His appearance was stating: come, beat me to death.</p>
 <p>“Did you think that I wouldn't dare?” The old man was so angry that his complexion turned deep red. He raised his hand and was about to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from within the war chariot. “Uncle Pang, let it pass.”</p>
 <p>When this voice sounded, that old man who was gnashing his teeth after being enraged by Chu Feng immediately stopped his hand. Even though he was a Martial Emperor, he actually moved to the side like a servant.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the rest of the people from the Ximen Imperial Clan also moved to the side.</p>
 <p>This scene came as quite a surprise to Chu Feng. So far, Chu Feng had seen many Martial Emperors. However, a Martial Emperor who acted servile like this old man was a first.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a young man walked out from the war chariot. This young man possessed a very handsome yet ice-cold appearance. In between his brows was a faint killing intent.</p>
 <p>This man belonged to the sort of people that one could tell was extraordinary from merely his appearance.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, not only did he possess an extraordinary appearance, his cultivation was also very strong. He was a rank five Half Martial Emperor. To reach rank five Half Martial Emperor at such a young age, he was wholly capable of contending against the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s disciple, Baili Xinghe.</p>
 <p>He was most definitely one of the top geniuses from the Holy Land of Martialism’s younger generation. Likely, he was the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Fifth Prince that people spoke of, Ximen Feixue.</p>
 <p>“If there’s nothing, we’ll take our leave first,” As Chu Feng spoke, he grabbed Jiang Furong’s wrist and began to walk toward the entrance of the competition.</p>
 <p>“Wait a moment,” However, right at this moment, that Ximen Feixue suddenly spoke.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? You also wish to kill me?” Chu Feng sneered.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you wish to die. Rest assured, since you’ve contradicted my Uncle Pang today, I will definitely take your life. However, it won’t be today, nor will it be here. I do not want your filthy blood to dirty Mooncloud City’s soil,” Ximen Feixue said with a cold voice.</p>
 <p>Once those words left his mouth, a chilliness swept forth. It was as if even the air had been frozen solid. Practically all of the younger generation present started to shiver. They were unable to resist that cold.</p>
 <p>Threatening. He was openly threatening Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, faced with Ximen Feixue’s threat, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. Instead, he smiled lightly and said, “I look forward to it.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he continued to walk toward the entrance. As he walked, everyone began to hurriedly make way for him; none of them dared to block his path.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng had dared to publicly contradict the Ximen Imperial Clan, this made the others feel that Chu Feng was no ordinary character.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng walked away, Ximen Feixue’s ice-cold gaze filled with killing intent was still fixed upon Chu Feng the entire time.</p>
