 <p><strong> Chapter 1961 - Emperor Chi’s Successor</strong></p>
 <p>“Are Lil Rou and Lil Mei going to follow the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and I?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“No, they’ll be following us. We will protect their safety,” Lord Luokong said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown. Lord Luokong and the others were going to go and fight against the Dark Hall. Following them would be safe?</p>
 <p>Would it really be safe to follow them?</p>
 <p>But, if Su Rou and Su Mei were to follow him and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Chu Feng would not be able to guarantee their safety either.</p>
 <p>In comparison, it was safer to send Su Rou and Su Mei to follow Lord Luokong and the Ancient Era’s Elves’ elites.</p>
 <p>But… Chu Feng was still extremely worried.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, rest assured. We will protect them with all of our strength,” Lord Luokong seemed to have realized Chu Feng’s worry and he spoke to guarantee their safety.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng said, “Actually, I know of a shortcut to the Immortality Peach Tree,”</p>
 <p>“Shortcut?” Hearing those words, the crowd were all startled.</p>
 <p>“Mn. Thus, if that killing formation is easy to contain, there will not be a need for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to journey alongside me. I will use the shortcut to arrive at the Immortality Peach Tree first and set up the spirit formation. With that, I should be able to prevent that killing formation’s activation,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Really?” Lord Luokong asked. After all, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was a rank seven Martial Emperor. If the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were to proceed to the formation’s core with them, then even if they were to start fighting against the Dark Hall, he would be an enormous assistance in the battle.</p>
 <p>In the end, Lord Luokong wanted the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to go with them too.</p>
 <p>The best way to solve this issue would be to fight against the Dark Hall in a battle to the death at the formation’s core. As for proceeding to the Immortality Peach Tree and setting up a formation to prevent the activation of the killing formation, it was only to guard against the unexpected.</p>
 <p>“It is true that I know of a shortcut. If I am to take that shortcut, I will be able to reach the Immortality Peach Tree much faster than the others,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>What Chu Feng said was the truth. The map that the Compass Immortal had given him also led to the Immortality Peach Tree. Merely, the route shown on the map that the Compass Immortal had given him was a shortcut.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, to Chu Feng’s pleasant surprise, that shortcut would also bring him to the location where the Beast Emperor’s treasures were hidden. It could be said that he would be hitting two birds with one stone.</p>
 <p>In other words, regardless of the situation, Chu Feng would have to take that shortcut. After all, Chu Feng’s original intention in coming to the Moonlight Maze was to obtain the Beast Emperor’s treasures.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, if Chu Feng were to take that shortcut, his speed would indeed be much faster than the map spread to the crowd by the Dark Hall. Thus, Chu Feng was not worried that he would not be able to make it to the Immortality Peach Tree in time.</p>
 <p>In fact, Chu Feng felt that he would have sufficient time to obtain the Beast Emperor’s treasures on the way, and still make it to the Immortality Peach Tree first.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he felt that he would still have sufficient time to set up a spirit formation to prevent the activation of the killing formation.</p>
 <p>As long as that killing formation could be stopped, Chu Feng, with his world spirit techniques, would definitely be able to stop it.</p>
 <p>If that killing formation could not be stopped, then, even if the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were to join him, it would still be useless.</p>
 <p>However, the most important aspect in regards to Chu Feng’s decision was that he was worried for Su Rou and Su Mei’s safety. He wanted the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to journey with Lord Luokong to ensure Su Rou and Su Mei’s safety.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, how did you come to know about that shortcut? Are you able to ascertain that that shortcut is real?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked. As this matter was of the utmost importance, he was worried.</p>
 <p>“Senior, look at this map. Do you think it’s real?” Chu Feng directly took out the Compass Immortal’s scroll.</p>
 <p>“Actually, we also know of a shortcut. Merely, that shortcut can only be opened with a key. Little friend Chu Feng, might that shortcut you’re talking about be the same shortcut that we know of?” Lord Luokong asked.</p>
 <p>“Lord Luokong, have a look,” Chu Feng handed the map to Lord Luokong.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, that is the one,” After seeing the map, Lord Luokong smiled in a relieved manner. He said, “This was the shortcut left behind by Qing Xuantian. That map itself is the key. It is real.”</p>
 <p>“With that map in hand, little friend Chu Feng will be able to reach the Immortality Peach Tree very quickly. If you are to set up a spirit formation there to prevent the activation of the killing formation, the effect would be even better,” At that moment, Lord Luokong was overjoyed. After all, this situation meant that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal would be able to travel with them.</p>
 <p>“But… what if the people from the Dark Hall decide to guard against the unexpected, and also dispatch people to the Immortality Peach Tree?” Su Mei said worriedly. Compared to the overall situation, she was more worried about Chu Feng’s safety.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think they will dispatch people there. After all, when the killing formation is successfully activated, everyone in the Immortality Peach Tree’s vicinity will die. I don’t think they will dispatch their own people there just to die. Furthermore, I doubt people would be willing to throw their lives away like that,” Lord Luokong said.</p>
 <p>“I think what Lil Mei said is not without reason. As the saying goes, better safe than sorry,” Su Rou added. She was also worried about Chu Feng’s safety.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, not even rank seven Martial Emperors can cause me harm. I possess a treasure that can kill rank seven Martial Emperors,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, both Su Rou and Su Mei grew quiet. The implication of Chu Feng’s words were clear. Rank seven Martial Emperors could not harm him; only rank eight Martial Emperors could harm him.</p>
 <p>As for rank eight Martial Emperors, what level of experts were they? They were people on par with Lord Luokong. If an expert of that level was at the Peach Immortality Tree, even if the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were to accompany Chu Feng, he would not be able to do anything anyway.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, then little friend Chu Feng, you carry an enormous responsibility. Make sure to be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Remember, at the crucial moment, you must save yourself first,” Lord Luokong said.</p>
 <p>Lord Luokong knew how important of a character Chu Feng was. He was a young man that could potentially become the second Qing Xuantian. Chu Feng’s safety was actually his greatest concern.</p>
 <p>“Lord Luokong, do not worry about me. I merely have one request. If you all are to encounter the Dark Hall, please do not act leniently toward them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Even if you didn’t tell us that, we would not act leniently toward them. I guarantee you that we will kill every one of them that we encounter,” Lord Luokong said.</p>
 <p>“Dark Hall, this time, I will definitely make you all suffer the consequences,” At that moment, Chu Feng’s fighting spirit was very strong. The reason for that was because this was the first actual confrontation between him and the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>Before, he had suffered enormously from them.</p>
 <p>This time, he was planning to make them suffer.</p>
 <p>After this matter was decided, Chu Feng went his separate way from the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others as he snuck into the crowd by himself, .</p>
 <p>Merely, this time around, Chu Feng did not reveal his true appearance. Instead, he had disguised himself.</p>
 <p>“Did you all see what Chu Feng did? He killed Xian Yuyin with a single strike.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve heard of it. I just didn’t see it. It’s truly a pity.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, Xian Yuyin was truly a disgrace. It’s great that Chu Feng killed him.”</p>
 <p>Just then, the people around him were all discussing the matter concerning Chu Feng and Xian Yuyin. Even though that event ended not long ago, it had already spread through this entire region.</p>
 <p>“Look, look. That’s a shameless fellow declaring himself to be Emperor Chi’s successor. Furthermore, he even said that he had fought against Chu Feng before and defeated him.”</p>
 <p>“For real? Quickly, let’s go and have a look. Exactly who is it that’s this shameless?” Suddenly, the crowd burst into an uproar. They all began to proceed toward the place indicated by that fellow.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the crowd was talking about, Chu Feng also grew curious. As there was still some time before the opening of the Moonlight Maze, and he had nothing to do in the meantime, Chu Feng decided to join the crowd and see what was going on. Mainly, he was interested in knowing exactly who it was that was so shameless as to boast about defeating him.</p>
 <p>Emperor Chi’s successor?</p>
 <p>Defeated him?</p>
 <p>Whoever it was was truly shameless.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng arrived within the crowd, he saw a silhouette. Upon seeing that person, Chu Feng’s eyes shone, and then, unable to contain himself, he burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>It was a man. His age was about the same as Chu Feng’s. Merely, his appearance was truly peculiar.</p>
 <p>He had a head of hedgehog-like super pointy hair. Although he was as thin as a match, his torso was actually bare naked.</p>
 <p>In fact, he was actually only wearing underpants, as well as a pair of straw sandals.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, his underpants were covered with flowery embroidery. It was truly flowery.</p>
 <p>As for his star sandals, they were actually colored. Furthermore, their colors were different. One was red, and the other was green.</p>
 <p>Truly, his appearance was that of an enormous weirdo, extremely ridiculous.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, that man spoke with a stutter. Yet, he was currently boasting before all these people.</p>
 <p>This man was someone that Chu Feng had met before. His name was Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>After seeing Wang Qiang, Chu Feng felt a burst of delight. Although that Wang Qiang was a weirdo, his nature wasn’t bad, and Chu Feng’s impression of him was pretty decent.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had never expected to be able to see Wang Qiang here after separating for so long. This was truly fate.</p>
 <p>“Mn?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng’s eyes shone. Even with his current strength, he was actually unable to see through Wang Qiang’s cultivation!!!</p>
