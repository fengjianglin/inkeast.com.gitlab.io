 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1576 - Eggy’s Awakening</strong></p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was frowning slightly. A trace of annoyance flashed past his eyes. What he disliked the most was people provoking him, regardless of who they might be.</p>
 <p>“Brother Zimo, it’s merely a handshake. I’ll shake your hand, is that fine with you?”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a powerful hand was suddenly extended forward and grabbed tightly onto Beitang Zimo’s hand. It was Nangong Ya.</p>
 <p>Nangong Ya had been the first to arrive. Nangong Baihe and the others were still rushing over. Evidently, they had come to help Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Nangong Ya, do not be so anxious. After this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly is over, we’ll determine who among us is stronger. However, right now, I still wish to conserve my strength.”</p>
 <p>Beitang Zimo smiled lightly and retrieved his extended hand. Then, he looked to Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli who were rushing over.</p>
 <p>With an evil smile, he said, “Those two sisters of yours are pretty good-looking. Seems like they’re a pair of beautiful sisters. Not bad, I like them. In two more years, I’ll go to your Nangong Clan and propose marriage. I’ll take both of them.”</p>
 <p>“Pah! Who’s going to marry you?” Nangong Baihe snorted coldly and spit a mouthful of spit onto the floor. She had an expression of displeasure and contempt.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, little girl, quite a hot temper you have there. However, that’s just the sort of temper that I like. Oh, that’s right. I can tell you all this. If I plan to marry you sisters, you would really not be able to stop me. After all, there’s such an enormous gap between our statuses. Me marrying you sisters would be a blessing to you two. Hahaha…” Beitang Zimo left as he laughed loudly.</p>
 <p>“That Beitang Zimo is truly a scoundrel. Big brother, why must we cooperate with this sort of person? Is our Nangong Imperial Clan unable to reach the Immortal Island by ourselves?” Nangong Baihe was so enraged by Beitang Zimo that her little face had turned red with fuming anger as she gnashed her teeth.</p>
 <p>“It is true that Beitang Zimo is quite a scoundrel. However, the Beitang Clan’s strength is quite strong. This sea is not safe at all. We experienced it ourselves on our way here. As for the path onward, it is filled with unknowns. To cooperate with the Beitang Clan is our best choice,” Nangong Ya explained.</p>
 <p>“In any case, I’m not going to marry him,” Suddenly, Nangong Moli said while pouting her mouth.</p>
 <p>“Haha, rest assured, I will definitely not let you marry that guy,” Nangong Ya laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, that Beitang Zimo is such a character. Once he sees beauties, he will be fascinated by them. With how beautiful Miss Tantai is, he naturally began to yearn for her. That is why he views you as an enemy.”</p>
 <p>“However, rest assured. With me here, I will definitely not let him do anything to you,” Nangong Ya guaranteed to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Got it,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said to Nangong Ya, “Brother Nangong, I’ve discovered some things that might be of some assistance to the journey onward.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that Nangong Ya was a pretty decent person. Thus, he decided not to conceal the matter regarding the stele from him. Instead, he told Nangong Ya about the stele.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, are you really certain that there was a stele here?” Nangong Ya was also a world spiritist. However, he was only a gold-cloak world spiritist. After hearing what Chu Feng told him, he immediately began to inspect the stone platform. However, he was unable to discover anything wrong with it.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, you shouldn’t bother doubting Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques are extremely powerful. Especially his pair of eyes, he is able to see things extremely precisely. I believe what he said is the truth,” Before Chu Feng could answer, Nangong Baihe spoke without any doubt.</p>
 <p>“Oh you girl, I never said that I didn’t believe Brother Chu Feng,” Nangong Ya smiled bitterly. Then, he said to the other Nangong Imperial Clansmen, “Do not mention this matter to others for now. It might be helpful to us.”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” The people from the Nangong Clan replied in unison without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>Among the younger generation of the Nangong Imperial Clan, Nangong Ya was someone with quite a lot of prestige. Regardless of whether it was his strength or character, he was someone who was widely acknowledged. Thus, among all of the members of the younger generation who had come here for the Immortal Island, he could be said to be their leader.</p>
 <p>After a short while, the joint advance party sent forth by the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan had returned and brought back with them a very important piece of intelligence.</p>
 <p>Two passages appeared on the path toward the Immortal Island.</p>
 <p>Like before, one was filled with dangers while the second one appeared to be safe. The people from the advance party had decided to enter into the passages to test them. In the end, three people from the Nangong Imperial Clan had been injured, two from the Beitang Imperial Clan were injured and one had died.</p>
 <p>“It’s another multiple choice question. Can’t that Weaponry Refinement Immortal do something else?” After receiving the intelligence that had been gathered, Nangong Baihe was very displeased.</p>
 <p>“Even though we know this is still a multiple choice question, we already know that we do not have to hesitate this time around. We’re going to pick the safe passage again. That dangerous passage is too dangerous. It is only a road that will lead to disaster,” said one of the Nangong Imperial Clansmen that had gone to survey the path ahead.</p>
 <p>He had entered the dangerous path before. Thus, he would never forget how dangerous that path was. He had only been able to escape from there due to luck.</p>
 <p>“Most of the people from our Nangong Imperial Clan and Beitang Imperial Clan have gathered here. It’s time for us to set off,” After coming to a decision, Nangong Ya firmly gave the order to set off. He wished to quickly reach the Immortal Island.</p>
 <p>However, due to the fact that not everyone from the Nangong Imperial Clan was here, Nangong Ya decided to leave two of the Nangong Imperial Clansmen behind to guide the way for anyone else from the Nangong Imperial Clan who might end up coming here by telling them which passage to take.</p>
 <p>After making their decision, they immediately set off. The joint forces of the Nangong Imperial and the Beitang Imperial Clan truly did appear to be very powerful at first glance.</p>
 <p>Thus, the people from the other powers, regardless of whether they were powerful experts from the younger generation or characters from the older generation, they all decided to follow the two Imperial Clans to proceed onward together with them.</p>
 <p>A thing worthy of mentioning was that even the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts all followed them over. It could be said Chu Feng and the others had truly set off with a vast and powerful momentum. To see this many Half Martial Emperor-level experts, Nangong Baihe and the others also felt a lot safer.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not feel that having more people meant that it would be safer. Instead, he felt that the more people there were, the less safe it would be. Especially those people from the Beitang Imperial Clan, Chu Feng did not trust them in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, young man, it seems that you do not feel safe at all.”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in Chu Feng’s ears. It was sweet-sounding, pleasant to listen to and charming. Upon hearing this voice, Chu Feng immediately became spirited.</p>
 <p>“Eggy, you’ve woken up?” Chu Feng was overjoyed. That was because he knew that the long-asleep Her Lady Queen had finally awoken. At this moment, Chu Feng’s joy could not be described with words. Thus, he completely ignored traveling and immediately cast his consciousness into his world spirit space.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, Eggy was standing in his world spirit space.</p>
 <p>She was wearing a black feathered miniskirt; she had a head of long black hair, a pair of large eyes, an exceptionally beautiful face and a charming yet adorable smile as she looked to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Eggy was as beautiful as ever. Her Lady Queen was as enchanting as ever. Her every frown and every smile was something that no one could compare with. To say that she was the number one beauty in the entire world would not be an exaggeration.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng’s body moved, and he directly arrived before her. Then, he extended his arms and gave Eggy a tight hug, firmly embracing Eggy’s body in his bosom.</p>
 <p>The separation of many days felt like decades to Chu Feng. That sensation of missing someone was something that only Chu Feng would understand. Thus, at this moment, the joy that he felt was also something that only Chu Feng would understand.</p>
