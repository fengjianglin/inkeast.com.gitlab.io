 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1623 - Chu Feng Attending A Banquet</strong></p>
 <p>“Firstly, this weapon is not an ordinary weapon. Before you pulled it open, I did not dare to be certain about that. However, I am now certain that it should be an Imperial Armament. Even though it is not entirely complete, it is still an Imperial Armament. Else, its aura would not be that many times more powerful than that of an Incomplete Imperial Armament.”</p>
 <p>“As for that ball of light, it likely contains a treasure. While I am not certain whether or not the treasure is really present, I think that what is contained in the ball of light is the secret to recovering this Imperial Armament.”</p>
 <p>“If you were able to recover this Imperial Armament and use it, you would likely become unstoppable. Among all of the Holy Land of Martialism’s younger generation, there has yet to be anyone with an Imperial Armament, no?”</p>
 <p>“Most importantly, this Coldsnow Dagger has chosen you. It is trying to have you become its master. Are you really planning to oppose its decision?” Eggy asked.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart moved slightly. He had actually also guessed that this Coldsnow Dagger might be an Imperial Armament that was not complete. After hearing what Eggy said, he was even more certain that was the case.</p>
 <p>Imperial Armament, what sort of treasure was that? In the Holy Land of Martialism, even Incomplete Imperial Armament copies were rare items that everyone wanted. As for actual Incomplete Imperial Armaments, they were extraordinarily rare items. As for Imperial Armaments, there was no need to mention them. They were truly priceless treasures capable of causing a rain of blood as people fought over them.</p>
 <p>However, even when faced with the treasure before him and that unknown secret, even though Chu Feng’s heart was moved, he still did not have the slightest bit of selfishness. That was because he knew that this belonged to Tantai Xue, that it was something that belonged to his friend. As such, he could not take it.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng said to Eggy again, “Eggy, just help me.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, you are truly an idiot. I don’t know what to do with you,” Eggy sighed and then walked out from that world spirit gate. Then, she used her enormously powerful strength and stepped forward to help Chu Feng and Tantai Xue. In the end, Eggy still decided to help them.</p>
 <p>Once Eggy started helping them, the spirit formation that Tantai Xue had set up started to tremble. Sure enough, Eggy was extremely powerful. Even though her current cultivation was inferior to Chu Feng’s and much inferior to Tantai Xue’s, her actual strength surpassed both of theirs.</p>
 <p>With Eggy’s help, that ball of light began to move toward Tantai Xue’s forehead. Even though the ball of light was struggling ferociously, it did not possess any offensive functions. As long as it managed to touch Tantai Xue’s forehead, it, along with the secret contained within it, would enter Tantai Xue’s brain.</p>
 <p>“You ungrateful wretch! I’ve chosen you, yet you actually want me to submit myself to another!?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a reprimanding voice sounded from that ball of light. Even though this voice did not contain any power, it was very vigorous, and capable of making one’s soul tremble. Sure enough, this Coldsnow Dagger possessed life.</p>
 <p>“Look, it even talked. It said that it has chosen you. You should stop opposing it,” Eggy said with a beaming smile. She was saying those words jokingly. However, Chu Feng knew that she was serious.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I’m sorry. You do not belong to me. Your true master is her,” Chu Feng felt very apologetic. That was because, at this moment, he was truly being very ungrateful.</p>
 <p>“Humph! You will regret renouncing me!” That ball of light said. Then, with an enormous force, it surged towards Tantai Xue. That ball of light directly entered Tantai Xue’s brain.</p>
 <p>After that ball of light entered her brain, Tantai Xue’s body started to emit light. Especially her forehead, which was shining the brightest.</p>
 <p>“Are you satisfied now? Tsk~~~” Eggy cast a side eye at Chu Feng, then returned to the world spirit space.</p>
 <p>After seeing that the light being emitted by Tantai Xue was declining, Chu Feng smiled a relieved smile.</p>
 <p>After a while, the light completely disappeared. Tantai Xue opened her eyes again. After she opened her eyes, the first words she said to Chu Feng was, “Thank you.”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to be this courteous to me. How was it? Is that ball of light useful?” Chu Feng asked while smiling.</p>
 <p>“Useful, extremely useful,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“That’s good then. Here, take this back. I believe the secret contained in that ball of light is related to it,” Chu Feng closed the Coldsnow Dagger and handed it to Tantai Xue.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Coldsnow Dagger no longer possessed that miraculous power. Anyone could pull it out now. However, this Coldsnow Dagger also did not possess any power. The reason for that was because it was incomplete.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xue received the Coldsnow Dagger and cautiously put it away. Then, she said to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, I am going to go to the Ten Thousand Miles Snow Domain.”</p>
 <p>“Ten Thousand Miles Snow Domain? What sort of place is that?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s located in the Overlord Domain. It could be said to be a very famous Forbidden Area in the Holy Land of Martialism. Even though it’s not as famous as the Ancient Era’s Cemetery, the Moonlight Maze or the Blood Devouring Killing Formation, it’s still a Forbidden Area that brings about fear to others.”</p>
 <p>“You’re going to such a dangerous place? Could it be that it’s related to the Coldsnow Dagger?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Tantai Xue nodded. Then, she said, “The reason why the Ten Thousand Miles Snow Domain is considered a Forbidden Area is because there’s a mysterious monstrous beast there by the name of Icesnow Phoenix. The Icesnow Phoenix is extremely mysterious. There are very few records about it even in history. The reason for that is because practically everyone who has seen it, was killed by it.”</p>
 <p>“I am going there precisely to find the Icesnow Phoenix. However, you don’t have to worry about me. It will not harm me, as I possess the Coldsnow Dagger,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“I understand. However, there are always accidents. You must be extra careful,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Tantai Xue said, “Chu Feng, how about you go there with me? After all, if the two of us are to travel together, we’ll be able to look after one another.”</p>
 <p>“You have your mission, and I have my own mission too,” Chu Feng refused. The reason he did that was actually for Tantai Xue’s sake. Chu Feng had offended the Beitang Imperial Clan. If he were to travel with Tantai Xue, it would be very dangerous for her. He could not allow himself to harm Tantai Xue.</p>
 <p>“Okay then,” Tantai Xue did not say anything else.</p>
 <p>Just like this, in one day, Chu Feng had not only seen Hong Qiang off, he had also seen Tantai Xue off. The three people who had entered into the Overlord Domain together parted with each other just like this.</p>
 <p>Worried that Chu Feng might be depressed, Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli started to keep close to Chu Feng. Not only did they eat with him, they actually even wanted to sleep with him.</p>
 <p>When night came, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli refused to leave. In the end, Nangong Ya used the justification that it was immoral for unmarried men and women to be together to persuade them to leave.</p>
 <p>The second day was the same as the first. Before the sky was even bright, they had come to find Chu Feng. However, when afternoon came, they were called away by others. It seemed that something had happened.</p>
 <p>After they left, Chu Feng finally managed to have time to himself. He immediately took out the Natural Oddity in his Cosmos Sack. When he saw that the seal on the Natural Oddity had been completely removed, Chu Feng was overjoyed.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng assessed the Natural Oddity for a bit. While he would not be able to reach a breakthrough after refining this Natural Oddity, it would provide him a sufficient amount of power. After some time, he might even be able to break through only by training and absorbing the natural energies of the world through the use of a mysterious technique.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about how he would soon be able to become a Half Martial Emperor, Chu Feng became extremely impatient to refine that Natural Oddity. Unfortunately, right at this moment, Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli had returned.</p>
 <p>They had returned to invite Chu Feng to participate in a gathering, a gathering of the Nangong Imperial Clan’s younger generation.</p>
 <p>“You said that the Nangong Imperial Clan’s princes and princesses are gathering together? Furthermore, they want to invite me?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Mn, your impressive feat on the Immortal Island has already spread to here. They all wish to meet you,” Nangong Ya said with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>However, at this time, Nangong Baihe spoke against it. “It’s best that you don’t go. They’re not good people. Likely, they have invited you with ulterior motives.”</p>
 <p>“You should go. It’s a rare invitation from them. If you are to not go, things might instead be taken poorly,” Nangong Ya said.</p>
 <p>“But, if Chu Feng is to go, they will likely make things difficult for him,” Nangong Baihe said.</p>
 <p>“There’s no harm, I’ll go have a look,” Right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke calmly with a smile on his face. He did not wish to make things difficult for Nangong Ya. Thus, even though he knew that it might be a Hongmen Banquet, Chu Feng must still attend said banquet.</p>
 <p>[1. Hongmen Banquet = Feast at Hong Gate, a banquet set up by Xiang Yu to attempt to murder Liu Bang. In other words, an ill intended banquet with the aim of murdering its guest. {If you’re a Game of Thrones fan, think Red Wedding}]</p>
