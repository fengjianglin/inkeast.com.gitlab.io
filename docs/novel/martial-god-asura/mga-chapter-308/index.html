 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 308 - Oppressive Killing Intent</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you...”</p>
 <p>Seeing the two Protectors in the peak of the Profound realm being defeated by Chu Feng with one strike, the Grey-cloak World Spiritist showed his teeth and his expression was called “wonderful”.</p>
 <p>But it was quite understandable after some careful thinking. After all, no matter how much stronger the two Protectors were, they were absolutely not stronger than Dugu Aoyun. If Dugu Aoyun couldn’t even defeat Chu Feng, how could the two of them be able to?</p>
 <p>*whoosh* Thinking to that point, the Grey-cloak World Spiritist did not attack Chu Feng and instead, he used an extremely strong martial skill to attack the Spirit Formation that Chu Feng laid. He actually wanted to escape.</p>
 <p>But as he faced the Grey-cloak World Spiritist’s miserable appearance, Chu Feng did not do anything to him. He only stood where he was and silently stared at him, as if he was looking at an amusing clown.</p>
 <p>*boom boom boom*</p>
 <p>“Dammit, dammit!!”</p>
 <p>Despite one powerful attack after the other was thrown out, despite one layer of ripple after the other was spread out, despite the Grey-cloak World Spiritist using up everything he had and using up all sorts of methods, he had no way of breaking the Spirit Formation that Chu Feng laid. It caused him to feel a bit of panic and anger.</p>
 <p>*whoosh*</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Grey-cloak World Spiritist turned and became a gust of wind. He dashed towards Su Rou and Su Mei. Since he had no results from escaping, he planned to use Su Rou and Su Mei as hostages.</p>
 <p>“Hmph.”</p>
 <p>But how could Chu Feng give him that chance? With a flash of light under his feet, in a blink, he arrived in front of Su Rou and Su Mei. Following that, he threw a punch towards the incoming Grey-cloak World Spiritist and it directly landed onto his chest.</p>
 <p>“Ahh!!”</p>
 <p>Strong power forced the Grey-cloak World Spiritist back. Crackling noises came from his chest, and even his internal organs were currently being crushed and crumbled. That pain was truly heart-tearing and lung-splitting.</p>
 <p>However, that was merely the beginning. How would Chu Feng so easily let anyone who had any ideas with Chu Feng’s women? Before the Grey-cloak World Spiritist even landed, with lightning speed, he darted behind him again. He grabbed his robe and fiercely threw him onto the ground.</p>
 <p>After he fell onto the ground. Chu Feng first stuck his left foot out, and with cracking noises, he snapped his left leg. Then his right leg also suddenly dropped down, and with more cracking noises, he snapped his right leg.</p>
 <p>After that, Chu Feng grabbed his crotch area. He tightly held the vulgar thing within his hand.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what are you going to do?!” With that, the Grey-cloak World Spiritist panicked. It didn’t matter if it were the other body parts, as he could heal them; but if that place was destroyed, there was no way of recovering it. The genitals the genitals, they were the root of life. Those things could not be joked around with.</p>
 <p>[TN: The characters that represent “genitals” here are “命根”, which directly translates to “life root”.]</p>
 <p>“Do what? This is the result of touching my women. You will be a eunuch when alive, and hard to be a ghost when you’re dead.” As Chu Feng spoke with a full face of fierceness, his hand suddenly clenched. With a “pu”, a large amount of blood sprayed and shot out from his hand. That thing was squeezed into blood.</p>
 <p>“Ahh~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>The pain under his groin caused the Grey-cloak World Spiritist to endlessly shriek and to never-endingly miserably wail because that was not only physical pain. It was also the pain in his soul. He knew that his life was finished, and even if he could continue living, he was fated to become a crippled person.</p>
 <p>So, he loudly yelled at Chu Feng, “Kill me! Kill me! Even if I become a ghost, I will not forgive you!!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Even if you don’t plead, I will still kill you.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng chillily smiled, formed a fist with one hand, and threw it towards the old man’s head. With a bang, his skull exploded like a watermelon and it exploded into pieces.</p>
 <p>*hmm*</p>
 <p>Just that time, suddenly, a strand of light that was quite difficult to detect drilled out from the exploded head. Chu Feng was already prepared for that situation. He raised his hand, grabbed, and the light was grasped within his hand.</p>
 <p>“Damn Chu Feng! Let me go, let me go!!”</p>
 <p>At that instant, within Chu Feng’s palm, the voice of the Grey-cloak World Spiritist sounded out again. But this time, within his voice, he no longer had the heart to wish to die. Rather, it contained incomparable fear.</p>
 <p>It was the consciousness that he condensed before dying. As long as the consciousness was there, he would be able to survive. But if this consciousness was destroyed, he would certainly completely die.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. I remember telling you that you wouldn’t even be able to be a ghost.” Chu Feng coldly smiled and his hand suddenly squeezed.</p>
 <p>“Ahh~~~~~~~~~” This time, the Grey-cloak World Spiritist made his last miserable cry and forever left the world.</p>
 <p>After killing the Grey-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng walked towards the two other Protectors who still survived with some breaths left. He arrived in front of them and asked, “Where is Qi Fengyang right now?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know!!” The black-haired Protector ferociously howled and he had a full face of resolution.</p>
 <p>*puchi* But before he even finished speaking, Chu Feng raised his feet and completely crushed his head.</p>
 <p>“How about you? Do you know where Qi Fengyang is right now?” Chu Feng looked towards the white-haired Protector.</p>
 <p>“Don’t...don’t kill me. I’ll tell you everything that I know...I’ll tell you everything that I know!”</p>
 <p>“Speak now!!”</p>
 <p>“Qi Fengyang entered the Heaven realm and that caused the master of the Qilin Prince’s Mansion to be extremely nervous. He was nervous that Qi Fengyang would threaten his position, so he joined hands with my school head, Yan Yangtian, and captured Qi Fengyang.”</p>
 <p>“Then, with Qi Fengyang committing treason as the reason, they locked him up. In a few more days, he will be executed. Right now, Qi Fengyang is imprisoned within the Qilin Prince’s Mansion.”</p>
 <p>*puchi* However, Chu Feng abruptly kicked and like the black-haired Protector, he died the same way.</p>
 <p>After killing the three of them, Chu Feng took their Cosmos Sacks from their waists, then absorbed and refined their Source energy. Only then did he cast his gaze towards Su Hen and slowly walked towards him.</p>
 <p>Currently, both of Su Hen’s feet were trembling. This entire body was trembling. After he, who was originally already afraid of Chu Feng, personally saw him kill the three experts in the peak of the Profound realm with ruthless methods, he could truly imagine how miserable his death would be.</p>
 <p>*poof* Suddenly, the city lord of the Vermilion Bird City knelt to the ground and endlessly kowtowed to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, please spare me, please spare me. I was truly forced and had no other choice! I had no intentions of harming you.”</p>
 <p>“For the sake of little Rou and little Mei, please spare my life and give me a chance to change and start over.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine no matter what you do to me, Chu Feng. However, you ignored your daughters’ happiness many times in order to continue living in this world. You truly aren’t qualified to be a father.” Chu Feng slowly walked over with oppressing killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Little Rou, little Mei, quickly plead for me! I know that I have wronged and I won’t force you two do anything else in the future. I will listen to you two no matter what I do!!” Seeing that it was useless begging to Chu Feng, Su Hen climbed towards Su Rou and Su Mei, hugged his two daughters’ legs and started to wail.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t kill my father. No matter how many thousands or tens of thousands of wrongs he did, he is still our father. He’s the only close family member we have in this world.” Su Mei was the first to go soft-hearted as she cried and begged for Su Hen.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, spare his life. No matter what, he is still our father. If he wasn’t here, we wouldn’t be here. No matter what he did wrong, we can only choose to forgive.” Su Rou also spoke.</p>
 <p>At that instant, Chu Feng stopped his steps. After that, he opened both of his arms and a wave of strong attraction power surged out and sucked the sisters Su Rou and Su Mei into his embrace, leaving only Su Hen where he was.</p>
