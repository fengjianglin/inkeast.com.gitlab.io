At that time, we encountered an opponent. As for that person, he was Chu Feng."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Merely, back then, we had no idea that Chu Feng was actually someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan," Liangqiu Hongyue explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Liangqiu Hongyue speak in such a serious manner, the crowd had no choice but to believe her. Thus, they all cast their gazes to Chu Feng. They'd all realized that that arrogant person of the younger generation seemed to have the means to act arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, compared to the elders, who began to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng, the people of the younger generation started feeling upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were people that revered powerful peers, their peer's status must also be taken into consideration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue were the personal disciples of Grandmaster Liangqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Wuma Shengjie, while he possessed an ordinary background, it remained that he was the prophesied child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Chu Feng, he was merely some brat from the Chu Heavenly Clan. His identity caused them to feel contempt for him from the bottoms of their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were feeling like a bunch of noble young masters encountering a commoner with talent and ability. Even if the talent and ability of that commoner caused them to feel inferior by comparison, those noble young masters were still qualified to look down on the birth of that commoner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instinctively, they would despise that commoner, and feel displeased and envious of them. Ultimately, they would wish for the failure of that commoner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There's actually such a thing?" Liangqiu Chengfeng nodded. He knew Liangqiu Hongyue's personality, and knew that she was a very prideful person. For her to be willing to mention her defeat of her own accord, it would appear that she had truly been forced into a corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the person that had forced her to such a state, it was naturally Wuma Shengjie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Liangqiu Chengfeng was the person who brought the Liangqiu Sisters there, he knew best what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Liangqiu Sisters arrived, they actually took the initiative to approach Wuma Shengjie. However, Wuma Shengjie was extremely aloof and proud. This caused the Liangqiu Sisters, especially Liangqiu Hongyue, extreme displeasure, and they likely already remembered the grudge in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During their future interactions, the Liangqiu Sisters would, from time to time, encounter conflicts with Wuma Shengjie. Unfortunately, Wuma Shengjie was not a person to be trifled with, and the Liangqiu Sisters were unable to win against him every single time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the three of them interacted with each other more and more, the Liangqiu Sisters viewed Wuma Shengjie as their rival. Thus, even though they were defeated by him, they would still not allow him to win just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of that, they would rather admit that they were inferior to Chu Feng than admit that they were inferior to Wuma Shengjie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Young friend Chu Feng, might you be willing to trouble yourself with helping us breach the defensive formation?" Liangqiu Chengfeng's voice was aimed toward Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You must be senior Liangqiu Chengfeng, right?" Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It is precisely this old man," Liangqiu Chengfeng answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It is this junior's honor to be able to assist senior in breaching the defensive formation. As such, I will naturally help senior."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"However, on the other side of this defensive formation is the Ancient Era's remnant. This junior is also quite interested in it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If this junior is to help, might senior be willing to discuss things with the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief, and allow myself and my Lord Clan Chief to enter the Ancient Era's remnant and share the profits too?" Chu Feng asked with his fist clasped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This guy is actually making a demand?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Furthermore, he wants to get a share of the profits?! Who the hell does he think he is?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd were immediately displeased by Chu Feng's words. Those from the younger generation began to openly complain. Although those from the older generation did not react in the same manner as the younger generations, they still scoffed, and cast looks of disgust at Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief did not say anything in regards to Chu Feng's demand. Actually, after he saw the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief, he had really wanted to request the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's help. Should he request the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's help, he would naturally have to share the profits with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely, after he learned of Chu Feng's status, he gave up on that thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wuma Shengjie was the Wuma Heavenly Clan's hope. As the clan chief of the Wuma Heavenly Clan, he did not wish for Chu Xuanyuan's son to steal Wuma Shengjie's limelight in their Wuma Heavenly Clan's territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Actually, young friend Chu Feng's request is not excessive at all. Unfortunately, I am merely a guest to this place too, and do not possess the authority to make such decisions. As such, I will have to consult with the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief regarding this matter. He shall be the one to make the decision," after Liangqiu Chengfeng finished saying those words, he looked to the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief was placed in a very difficult situation. For Liangqiu Chengfeng to say those words, it meant that he had expressed his standpoint on the matter. With that, how could he possibly refuse?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, right after Liangqiu Chengfeng finished saying those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said, "Young friend Chu Feng, this old man is able to agree to that request of yours. Merely... if you're unable to open that defensive formation, what will you do then?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's words were spoken with a gentle laugh. He had deliberately relaxed his tone, and said those words in a manner as if he were joking around, and not deliberately making things difficult for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was definitely making things difficult for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What he was implying with his words was that Chu Feng would naturally be allowed to enter the Ancient Era's remnant should he be able to breach the defensive formation. However, should he fail to do so, he should scram back to where he came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng smiled gently at the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's words. He said, "Senior, it is you who need my assistance right now. If I am able to open that defensive formation, it would naturally be good. If I am unable to do so, then I am unable to do so. What more do you want from me? After all, all these seniors present have failed to breach the defensive formation, no?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Shameless."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Chu Feng said those words, it was not only the people from the younger generation that started to curse him out; even the grand characters present inside the grand formation revealed helpless expressions.</span></p>

That fellow not only had vast nerve, but his skin was also very thick. He actually dared to threaten Liangqiu Chengfeng and the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Threatening, this was naturally threatening. They were merely asking for him to try to help them, yet he actually demanded the qualifications to enter the Ancient Era's remnant and share the treasures.</span></p>

In my opinion, it's best that we tell him to scram out of here," someone inside the formation core said. That person was one of those people that did not wish for the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief to join them, and argued with Li Ruochu earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You don't want him to try? Are you able to unseal this defensive formation then?" Liangqiu Chengfeng asked.</span></p>

Besides, isn't young friend Wuma Shengjie capable of unsealing this defensive formation anyways?" That man said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's right. There’s really no need for us to give the two of them such precious spots for free just so that he can attempt to unseal the defensive formation. After all, this is a rare Ancient Era's remnant that we're talking about here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many other grand characters also began to voice their concern.</span></p>

Are you all capable of waiting that long?" Liangqiu Chengfeng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he said those words, many people revealed a change in expression. Indeed, a year was truly a bit excessive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, another thought soon came to their minds. To martial cultivators, a year could not be considered long at all. That was even more the case when compared to precious treasures.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This..." Hearing those words, those people swallowed the words that they wanted to say.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liangqiu Chengfeng's attitude was firm. Furthermore, he was the most important person for the unsealing formation. They could not do without him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, no matter how unwilling they were, they had no choice but to declare their decision to follow him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Milord, in this place, you are the one who gets to make the final decision. We are merely offering you suggestions. Since Milord already has a decision in mind, we'll have him give it a try then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the crowd had smiles on their faces when they said those words, their hearts were filled with unwillingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the result of having insufficient strength. Even though they were all people of status, their words did not hold any weight there. They could only obey Liangqiu Chengfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing they could do about it. After all, Liangqiu Chengfeng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and the most crucial person to breaching the defensive formation.</span></p>
