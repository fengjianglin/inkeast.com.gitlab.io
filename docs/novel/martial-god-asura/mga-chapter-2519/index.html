 <p><strong> Chapter 2519 - Cold-blooded and Ruthless</strong></p>
 <p>Honestly, it was quite ironic.</p>
 <p>Before Chu Feng came, the great majority of the people there had looked down on him.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, there was not a single person present that was not afraid of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng walked over, the crowd were not only trembling with fear, they also hurriedly moved to either side in fear that Chu Feng would attack them.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a path emerged from the crowd, a path toward the palace.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng walked through the path and past Zhou Fukong and the others. He did not stop, nor did he try to make things difficult for them.</p>
 <p>It was as if… Chu Feng was ignoring them.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng continued forward, straight for the palace, straight for Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd started to rejoice. No matter what, Chu Feng had, at the very least, not killed them yet. This was already an enormously fortune among this great misfortune.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng had entered the palace hall, an old man’s body shifted and entered the void.</p>
 <p>Evidently, that individual was trying to seize the opportunity to escape.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he did not even bother to turn around. Instead, with his back facing the crowd, he shot forth a palm strike.</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~~”</p>
 <p>The palm strike exploded in the distant space. It turned into energy ripples that started to wreak havoc through space.</p>
 <p>As the energy ripples wreaked havoc, a figure appeared out of thin air. Like a dying dog, that figure fell from the sky and ruthlessly crashed onto the surface.</p>
 <p>It was a person. His clothes had been completely shattered by the explosion. His body had turned pitch-black as his flesh was burned. Furthermore, he was twitching nonstop.</p>
 <p>As for that individual, he was none other than that old man who had entered the void in an attempt to escape earlier.</p>
 <p>Although he was still alive, he had been seriously injured.</p>
 <p>“Sssss~~~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd’s hearts tightened. No one dared to think about escaping again.</p>
 <p>One should know that the old man that had entered the void and was then seriously injured by Chu Feng was a peak Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>However, such a peak Martial Ancestor was unable to even withstand a single palm strike from Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In fact, when Chu Feng attacked, he did not even bother to look back. Yet, an attack with his back facing his target was actually able to seriously injure his target.</p>
 <p>From this, the crowd once again experienced how frightening Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>After shooting down that escapee, Chu Feng still didn’t say anything. At that moment, he had arrived before Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and the cage shattered into pieces. At the same time, the chains binding Zhao Hong were also shattered by him.</p>
 <p>Those were special chains. They were not very strong. Merely, when they were used to tie up seriously injured individuals, they would be able to restrict their cultivation.</p>
 <p>After the chains were shattered, Zhao Hong’s cultivation rapidly recovered. As for her injuries, they were merely superficial injuries, and not serious.</p>
 <p>There was simply no need for Chu Feng to heal Zhao Hong’s injuries. She sat cross-legged and began to operate her world spirit power. Soon, the insects within her were all driven out, and her flesh started to heal.</p>
 <p>In merely the blink of an eye, Zhao Hong returned to normal. Not to mention not having any scars on her face, there was not even a speck of dust on her face. Even her clothes that were pierced through by the sword had been restored to normal.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you damned bastard, so you were actually going to become this powerful after reaching rank eight Martial Ancestor. Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p>
 <p>“You made me think that you were only going to come out of your closed-door training after reaching rank nine Martial Ancestor. That’s why I decided to come here myself. Unfortunately, I ended up falling into that Kong Doumoyuan’s trap.”</p>
 <p>Although Zhao Hong was complaining, she was brimming with smiles on her face.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng’s close friend, she would naturally be very happy for Chu Feng to find out that he would possess such overwhelming abilities after two years.</p>
 <p>“My apologies. I should’ve explained myself to you beforehand. I’ve made you suffer,” Even though he knew that Zhao Hong was merely joking, Chu Feng was feeling sorry from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>He felt that although Zhan Hong was reckless to come by herself, it was because she was worried for Wang Qiang. He was able to understand that.</p>
 <p>If he had told Zhao Hong that he would definitely be able to defeat Kong Doumoyuan once he reached rank eight Martial Ancestor, then Zhao Hong would not have ended up in her earlier miserable state.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, he came right on time. What would’ve happened if he was late?</p>
 <p>If he were to truly come late, then he would likely end up recovering Zhao Hong’s corpse.</p>
 <p>If Zhao Hong were to die, how could Chu Feng possibly face Wang Qiang?</p>
 <p>“Enough, you. I was merely joking. I was clearly the one in the wrong, why are you apologizing? You’re making me feel uncomfortable,” Zhao Hong had a smile on her face as she punched Chu Feng’s chest. Then, she actually revealed an apologetic expression on her face.</p>
 <p>It could be seen that Zhao Hong knew that she had made a grave mistake.</p>
 <p>“You’ve already suffered. This is not something that can be changed. However, we must take revenge.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he turned his gaze to the crowd behind, “How do you want to handle these people?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Zhou Fukong and the others that were standing there in a well-behaved manner all felt their hearts tighten.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, it was as they had worried, Chu Feng did not plan to leave the matter at that.</p>
 <p>However, there was nothing they could do. Faced with such a powerful Chu Feng, they were truly nothing more than fish and meat on the chopping block.</p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng, Miss Zhao Hong, we were truly only invited here by Kong Doumoyuan. We never had the intention to disrespect you all.”</p>
 <p>“Miss Zhao Hong, this old man was not among the crowd to torture you earlier. Please inform Young Hero Chu Feng properly of this so that the innocent are not harmed.”</p>
 <p>Many among the people present feared death. Seeing that the situation had turned bad, they no longer cared about their status, and started tearing up. They pretended to be pitiful, and cried to gain sympathy.</p>
 <p>“Shut up! I will cut off the tongue of he who dares to utter another word!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a stern shout was heard. Like a sudden clap of thunder, that shout echoed in the sky for a very long time.</p>
 <p>At that moment, those people begging for forgiveness all shut their mouths immediately. Those who were planning to start begging for forgiveness did not dare to open their mouths.</p>
 <p>It was not that they were cowards. Merely, the person who shouted at them to shut up was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was someone who dared to do anything. As such, how could they dare to go against his order?</p>
 <p>“Zhao Hong, say, how do you want to handle them?” Chu Feng looked to Zhao Hong and asked again.</p>
 <p>“I don’t care about the others. However…” As Zhao Hong spoke, she pointed to Kong Doumoyuan, Dugu Jianxu, the Wine-Meat Monk and Zhou Fukong, “him, him, him and him… they must all die today.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the expressions of Dugu Jianxu and the others immediately turned ashen.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for Zhou Fukong. He was so scared that his eyes were wide open, and he was tongue-tied speechless. He started sweating profusely. His legs started shaking so hard that he was unable to even stand stably, nearly falling from the sky.</p>
 <p>“You all hear that?” Chu Feng turned his gaze over and cast his gaze over Dugu Jianxu, the Wine-Meat Monk, Zhou Fukong and Kong Doumoyuan.</p>
 <p>Sensing Chu Feng’s gaze that was filled with killing intent, Dugu Jianxu and the others turned green with fear. They knew that Chu Feng was truly planning to kill. It was clear… they would not be able to escape a calamity.</p>
 <p>At that moment, they were filled with regret. They regretted that they insulted and made things difficult for Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>Originally, it was only a grudge between Kong Doumoyuan and Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang. However, they were now wrapped up in it too.</p>
 <p>If they could choose again, they would definitely not have made things difficult for Zhao Hong. Unfortunately… they had no chance to choose again.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, all of this is Kong Doumoyuan’s doing. He was the one to capture Zhao Hong. He was also the one to torture Zhao Hong. This is unrelated to us. Why must you be so forceful and insistent on killing us?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you really shouldn’t do this. Let’s just drop this matter here today. We can talk things over. If you are to kill us, you will not have an easy time in the future either. You must definitely reconsider things.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, calm down, calm down. You must not allow your emotions to affect your decisions.”</p>
 <p>Dugu Jianxu and the others started to explain themselves and started to urge Chu Feng to reconsider killing them. They truly did not want to die.</p>
 <p>However, as if he could not hear them, Chu Feng did not bother to respond to their words at all.</p>
 <p>“Dugu Jianxu, you are the most talkative. Let’s start with you.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s gaze turned to Dugu Jianxu. He began to walk toward Dugu Jianxu. Zhao Hong was following behind him.</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Dugu Jianxu’s body started to tremble violently. Then, he felt that his body had turned ice-cold. It was as if even his soul was trembling.</p>
 <p>He felt that the current Chu Feng was like a cold-blooded and ruthless beast. He only saw his prey in his eyes. As for that prey, it was him… Dugu Jianxu.</p>
