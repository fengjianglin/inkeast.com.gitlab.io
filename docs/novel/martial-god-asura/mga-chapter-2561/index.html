 <p><strong>Chapter 2561 - The Third Prophesied Person</strong><br>　　<br>“Did you see that? The Demon Armament that you’re so scared of is merely this,” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said to the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>Actually, there was no need for the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief to call this to attention, as the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had witnessed everything that had happened.</p>
 <p>“Worked, it really worked. The Demon Armament Suppression Talisman really worked!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had completely changed. Not only was he no longer afraid, but he even let out frantic laughter.</p>
 <p>It was as if his feelings that had been repressed for so long were finally able to be unleashed.</p>
 <p>Then, he looked to Chu Feng with eyes filled with complacence. Loudly, he said, “Chu Feng, so what if you possess a Demon Armament? Are you able to unleash its powers?”</p>
 <p>“Today, that Demon Armament of yours will be purified, and you will be killed here.”</p>
 <p>“Damn it.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng began to pour all of his power into the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>He did not give his body to the Evil God Sword. However, he unleashed his greatest power to urge the Evil God Sword to give out greater strength.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”<br>　　<br>At that moment, the Evil God Sword immediately had a reaction.</p>
 <p>Surging crimson gaseous flames once again started overflowing from it. The crimson clouds once again appeared in the sky.</p>
 <p>Although the crimson gaseous flames were inferior to before, as they were being suppressed by the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, they managed to cover a fifth of that entire region.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they were gradually expanding in size.</p>
 <p>The Evil God Sword’s power was currently recovering.</p>
 <p>“Don’t even think of it!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief tossed his Demon Armament Suppression Talisman toward the sky.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>After being unleashed by the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and entering the sky, the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman reacted as if it had been liberated.</p>
 <p>Not only was the golden radiance it emitted even more dazzling, but many characters began to appear on the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.</p>
 <p>Those characters started to float out from the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, and began to spread everywhere with the golden radiance.</p>
 <p>It was as if the golden radiance was the sea, and the characters were fishes in the sea.</p>
 <p>Just like that, those characters started to surge forth in the sea, covering all the locations that the golden radiance had spread to.<br>　<br>Those were very ancient characters. They were most likely characters from the Ancient Era. As such, they could not be interpreted.<br>　<br>However, after those characters appeared, the power of the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman grew even more powerful.<br>　　<br>In fact, Chu Feng and the others were even able to hear an ancient voice being emitted by the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman nonstop.<br>　<br>They were simply unable to make sense of that voice. However, they felt a very sacred sensation upon hearing it.<br>　<br>At that moment, even though Chu Feng was going all-out to urge the Evil God Sword, the crimson gaseous flames emitted by the Evil God Sword were still being suppressed. Chu Feng was unable to unleash the power of the Evil God Sword.<br>　　<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword started to tremble violently. It was as if it was feeling extremely unreconciled.</p>
 <p>“Bastard brat, hand your body over to this Evil God. Let this Evil God destroy that thing.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Evil God Sword’s voice was sounding in Chu Feng’s ears nonstop. Its tone was filled with anger.</p>
 <p>It was reacting as if someone had desecrated it. It was determined to inflict punishment upon that person. It was determined to reveal its power.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng felt even greater murderous desire from the Evil God Sword’s voice.<br>　<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng was even more reluctant to hand his body to the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>“Why are you still standing there? Eliminate him immediately!” The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted at the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.<br>　<br>Although the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was able to suppress Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword using the power of the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, he was evidently unwilling to continue their stalemate. He was determined to quickly kill Chu Feng because he felt that there would be hidden dangers if Chu Feng were to be kept alive any longer.</p>
 <p>After all, he had already personally experienced the aura of Chu Feng’s Demon Armament. Fortunately, they possessed the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. Otherwise, he also felt that they’d have all been killed.</p>
 <p>By relying only on their own strength, none of the people present would be able to contend against Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for you to remind me.”</p>
 <p>The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief held his Ancestral Armament in hand and began to fly toward Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>Merely, his target was not Zi Xunyi, but rather Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The person he wanted to kill the most was Chu Feng. The reason for that was because he felt the greatest threat right at that moment to be Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zi Xunyi who was half kneeling on the floor and in extremely weak health suddenly stood up.</p>
 <p>At the moment she stood back up, the two Ancestral Armament daggers that had landed not far away also flew into her hands.</p>
 <p>“Scram!”<br>　　<br>Zi Xunyi’s arms moved as two blade rays shot out from her Ancestral Armament daggers. The two blade rays criss-crossed one another as they were shot out to cut the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief down.<br>　　<br>“Humph, the current you will not be able to stop me,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sneered.</p>
 <p>Then, he lightly waved his Ancestral Armament and easily dispersed Zi Xunyi’s blade rays.<br>　<br>Following that, he slashed down with his Ancestral Armament inin Chu Feng’s direction.</p>
 <p>Before the Ancestral Armament reached Chu Feng, the blade ray that it sent forth was on its way to cut down Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>With the might and distance of this attack, Chu Feng would not be able to avoid it. If he was struck by it, his body and soul would be completely shattered and he would undoubtedly die.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zi Xunyi appeared before Chu Feng. She placed the daggers in her hand before him and forcibly blocked the incoming blade ray.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>However, after blocking the blade ray, Zi Xunyi was not only knocked back several steps, but she also vomited a mouthful of blood.<br>　　<br>Then, she sat powerlessly beside Chu Feng. Zi Xunyi’s injuries were extremely serious; she simply did not have the strength to continue battling. She was totally putting her life on the line to block the attacks from the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.<br>　　<br>“Look at yourself, you’re still trying to protect him?” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said to Zi Xunyi mockingly.<br>　<br>“As long as I am still alive, you can forget about touching him in the slightest.”</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi stood back up with great difficulty and once again walked before Chu Feng, shielding him behind her.</p>
 <p>Firm determination filled her eyes.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart was moved.</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi and him were only people that had just met. Even though they got along very well, there was still no reason for her to go so far.</p>
 <p>Yet, Zi Xunyi had decided to do so. She was willing to sacrifice herself to protect him.</p>
 <p>Oh how loyal and righteous she was. “Very well, since you insist on it, I will kill you first.”</p>
 <p>As the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he slashed his Ancestral Armament at Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi tried her best to unleash her martial power. However, as if her martial power was completely extracted from her, she was unable to unleash anymore of her martial power.</p>
 <p>The current her was simply powerless to block the attack from the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.<br>　<br>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, a large crimson blade suddenly stood horizontally before Zi Xunyi, blocking the attack from the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.<br>　　<br>At that moment, Chu Feng’s expression changed greatly. It was not only Chu Feng; the expressions of everyone present had changed greatly.<br>　<br>The reason for that was because not only did a large crimson blade appear, but a figure was also standing before Zi Xunyi.<br>　　<br>That person was wearing armor. Although he had a humanoid appearance, he was not human. The reason for that was because his skin was completely covered in crimson scales.<br>　<br>That said, his aura was extremely powerful. He was a rank two True Immortal.</p>
 <p>That person was the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. With an Ancestral Armament blade in hand, he blocked the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s attack.<br>　　<br>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly waved his blade. He actually managed to force the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief back.</p>
 <p>The power behind his slash was so strong that the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was pushed several thousand meters away. Even the Ancestral Armament the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief held in his hand was trembling violently.<br>　<br>“You dared injure her, all of you shall die!!!”<br>　　<br>Right at that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief let out an incomparably furious roar.</p>
 <p>It was as if Zi Xunyi was his dragon’s forbidden inverse scale. Whoever dared to touch her would be met with death.</p>
