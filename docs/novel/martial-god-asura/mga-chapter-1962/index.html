 <p><strong> Chapter 1962 - Entering The Maze</strong></p>
 <p>Wang Qiang was still the same as always; he was still bragging about how powerful he was.</p>
 <p>However, as Chu Feng saw the reactions of the surrounding crowd, he felt them to be quite amusing. The reason for that was because no one believed in Wang Qiang. Many of the people thought Wang Qiang to be a shameless lunatic, and were merely watching this show for enjoyment.</p>
 <p>In fact, there were even people who insulted him on the spot. From this, it could be seen that Chu Feng possessed a very high status in the hearts of the crowd. Else, there would be no reason for them to insult Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>However, with how thick-skinned Wang Qiang was, how could he possibly care about the insults being thrown at him? Not only did he not care about them, he instead spoke back to them mockingly.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he did not reveal his true appearance, nor did he call out to Wang Qiang. After all, Chu Feng did not know whether or not there were people from the Dark Hall amongst the crowd. Even though he knew that the people from the Dark Hall did not plan to kill him, this was only limited to the time being. Sooner or later, they would aim to kill him.</p>
 <p>In order to guard against the unexpected, even if Chu Feng were to reveal himself, he would only do so after entering the Moonlight Maze.</p>
 <p>Just like that, Chu Feng concealed his identity the entire time until the day the Moonlight Maze was opened. Then, Chu Feng followed the crowd and entered the Moonlight Maze.</p>
 <p>The Moonlight Maze was truly an extraordinary place. Countless legends swirled around it. Furthermore, the majority of those legends were concerning treasures.</p>
 <p>Several tens of millions of people had arrived at the Moonlight Maze. As such, the first group of people to enter the Moonlight Maze also numbered extremely high; there were actually over a million individuals.</p>
 <p>These million-plus people were of all different cultivations. Not to mention Martial Kings, there were even Martial Lords who came to get in on the action.</p>
 <p>Many of the people who came were dreaming of becoming lucky and striking it rich. Even though they knew that their cultivations were very weak, they still wanted to test their luck.</p>
 <p>Of course, other than just those people, the majority of the people who dared to enter the Moonlight Maze were prepared. Not only were the people from the Three Palaces, Four Clans, Nine Powers and the many monstrous beast races present, there were also old monsters who had hidden themselves in seclusion for a long time present as well.</p>
 <p>In fact, some among those old monsters were people whose fame was widespread throughout the Holy Land of Martialism, people who even the Three Palaces wanted to rope into their powers.</p>
 <p>However, they were all people who were about to die from old age. They had all come for the sake of that legendary Immortality Peach Tree. Merely… they did not know that the map’s destination was actually the Immortality Peach Tree. The reason for that was because even though the Dark Hall had scattered the maps all over, they had not indicated what was at the destination of the map.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was among the first group to enter the Moonlight Maze. After all, he possessed the important mission of preventing the death of the crowd. in the beginning, everything was fine. However, as the crowd moved forward, someone accidently triggered a spirit formation. Although that spirit formation did not cause any harm to the crowd, it sealed the path ahead.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, that’s a world spirit formation. It’s impossible to destroy it. What do we do now?”</p>
 <p>“Who triggered that trap? Get out here!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd started to become agitated. They were planning to condemn the person that had triggered the trap.</p>
 <p>Naturally, in this sort of situation, no one would be willing to admit that it was them. After all, none of them were stupid. If they were to admit to it, they would simply be courting death from a beating. In fact, their corpse might not even be left whole.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a Heavenly Law Palace’s elder spoke. “Everyone, don’t panic. Based on this old man’s judgement, although that spirit formation is very powerful, it will disappear by itself after seventy-two hours.”</p>
 <p>“Since we cannot break through it, let’s wait patiently.”</p>
 <p>That elder’s name was Yue Ling. His cultivation was pretty decent; he was a rank six Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he was a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, and one of the Heavenly Law Palace’s management elders.</p>
 <p>Thus, this Elder Yue Ling possessed quite a large amount fame in the Holy Land of Martialism. As such, his words held authority, and many people began to believe him.</p>
 <p>“Elder Yue, you’re a world spiritist. Could it be that even you are unable to do anything to that spirit formation?” Someone asked.</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing I can do,” Elder Yue Ling shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Then, won’t we have to wait seventy-two hours? After seventy-two hours, how many more people from behind us will have entered the Moonlight Maze?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, many people were frowning. Those that were able to be in the first group’s vanguard were all people with decent cultivations; they were all experts above rank eight Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>To put it simply, the first group’s vanguard were mainly composed of Martial Emperors and peak Half Martial Emperors. They were the elite among the million plus people.</p>
 <p>As everyone possessed selfish desires, those from the vanguard who rushed to be the first to enter the Moonlight Maze did so for the sake of shaking off the people behind them. They did not wish to share the rewards with the people after them.</p>
 <p>If they were forced to stay here for seventy-two hours, all of the people from behind them would’ve caught up to them. In that case, their effort to be the vanguard would be all in vain. Evidently, they did not wish for such a thing to happen.</p>
 <p>“Apart from that, there is nothing else we can do,” Elder Yue Ling said.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Wang Qiang stuttered, “Ol, old, old fart, yo, you, you’re wr, wr, wrong.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” Hearing those words, Elder Yue Ling’s sword-like eyebrows narrowed. He was angered. He was not only angry because Wang Qiang was questioning his decision. Most importantly, it was because Wang Qiang rudely called him ‘old fart.’</p>
 <p>“I sa, said that yo, you’re wr, wrong. Ac, ac, actually, th, th, th, there is a way. Dra, dragon Mark Ro,royal-cloak World Spi,spiritsts will be able to br, bre, break thro, through that obs, obstruction,” Wang Qiang said.</p>
 <p>“Dragon mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist? You speak of it that casually, why don’t you go and find one?” Elder Yue Ling said in a displeased manner.</p>
 <p>“I, I, I, I kn, kn, kn, know a person. He, he’s a Dra, dra, dra, dragon Mark Royal-cloak Wo, wo, world Spiritist. I be, be, believe he is he, he, here righ, right now,” Wang Qiang said.</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about the Weaponry Refinement Immortal?” Someone asked.</p>
 <p>“No, no, no, it, it, it’s not o, o, o, only the Weaponry Ref, Refinement Immortal that ca, cam, came here,” Wang Qiang said.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking about the Demonic Genius Immortal Chu Feng?” Someone thought of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Not only was Chu Feng a demon-level character, he was also a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, many people had seen Chu Feng arriving at the Moonlight Maze. Thus, they knew that there was actually a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist here.</p>
 <p>“Th, th, th, th, th, that’s right,” Wang Qiang nodded with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng? Demonic Genius Immortal? Heh…” At that moment, Elder Yue Ling laughed lightly. However, his laughter was filled with mockery. He added, “Chu Feng was already scared away by the Ancient Era’s Elves after killing Xian Yuyin. He simply does not dare to show up here.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, even if he came, with his world spirit techniques, how could he possibly be able to break apart that spirit formation?”</p>
 <p>“Although this old man is not a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, I know that there exists a difference in strength between Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists.”</p>
 <p>“The spirit formation here is extremely powerful. It is impossible to break through it even if all of us were to attack it with all our combined strength. As such, how could a mere brat possibly be able to undo that spirit formation?”</p>
 <p>“Regardless, I do not care whether or not you all believe that Chu Feng is capable of doing that or not. However, this old man absolutely will not believe it,” Elder Yue Ling mocked.</p>
 <p>From his words, it could be seen that he seemed to despise Chu Feng enormously. In other words, he possessed quite a bit of hostility toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“If I were able to undo the spirit formation, Elder, what would you do?” Right at that moment, Chu Feng revealed his true appearance and walked out of the crowd.</p>
 <p>He had shown himself. Chu Feng had carefully inspected the crowd after entering this place, and discovered that there didn’t seem to be people among the Dark Hall here. As such, he decided that there would be no harm in him revealing himself.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng urgently wished to obtain the Beast Emperor’s treasures. Thus, he did not plan to waste time here anyways. He had already planned to reveal himself.</p>
 <p>And now, there was actually someone that was questioning his ability and even mocking him. As such, Chu Feng must teach him a lesson, and show him what kind of Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist he was.</p>
