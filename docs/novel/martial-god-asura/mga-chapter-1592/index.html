 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1592 - Training Begin</strong></p>
 <p>“Eggy, could it be that you want me to ask the Weaponry Refinement Immortal for help? How could he possibly help me? You’ve also seen how even the Left Reverend would not help me. Thus, it’s even more impossible for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to help me.”</p>
 <p>“That blind senior has his own intentions. He wants me to grow on my own. Thus, he is not going to use his relations to help me. Otherwise, he would have already helped me by now,” Chu Feng shook his head while smiling.</p>
 <p>“You’re being foolish. Who said that you must search for help from others? Who said that you can’t do it yourself? Could it be that you’ve forgotten that Old Daoist Ghost Face’s Cosmos Sack contains two World Spirit Stones that contain Dragon Mark Royal-level spirit energy?” Eggy reminded.</p>
 <p>“That’s true!” After hearing what Eggy said, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. He immediately took out two stones from his Cosmos Sack.</p>
 <p>These two stones were very small. They were only about half a palm in size. Other than being flat, they looked like ordinary stones. However, the two stones were emitting a faint golden light, and contained within them was Royal-level spirit energy. Most importantly, these two stones actually possessed dragon-like marks all over them.</p>
 <p>“These here are Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. I had thought that your world would not possess something like these. However, it would appear that it does.”</p>
 <p>“These stones are very precious, and also very hard to use. Only Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists are capable of using them. However, your current spirit power is very strong, and your world spirit techniques also surpass those of ordinary Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, you might be able to use them,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Eggy said, Chu Feng attempted to use the stones. After spending some time and putting forth effort, he actually managed to extract some spirit energy from them. The spirit energy fused with his own spirit energy, and ended up being able to be used by him.</p>
 <p>“I am indeed able to use them. However, the energy contained within these two stones is truly too little. They’re simply not enough to activate the Evil Spirit Binding Formation,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s simple. When even someone like the Old Daoist Ghost Face is capable of finding these two Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, how could you not be able to find some more?”</p>
 <p>“Think about it. As long as you manage to find a sufficient amount of Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, you would be able to control that Martial Emperor-level Asura World Spirit. At that time, who would dare to become your enemy in this Holy Land of Martialism?”</p>
 <p>“From then on, you would be able to bring it with you to challenge the various dangerous locations or forbidden areas. You would be able to search for Natural Oddities without any restraint. Then, after you refined those Natural Oddities, your cultivation would rapidly increase. It is very worthwhile. Truly worthwhile,” Eggy began to clap her hands and applaud. It was as if she was seeing the day where Chu Feng controlled that Martial Emperor-level Asura World Spirit as he traveled through the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>“Although it’s difficult, it is indeed feasible,” After hearing what Eggy said, Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not wish to rely on the strength of others in his own road of cultivation. However, if he were to control the world spirit within his body, it would be completely different from relying on someone else.</p>
 <p>That was because relying on his world spirit would not be considered to be relying on someone else. Rather, it would be equivalent to his own strength. After all, that world spirit belonged to him to begin with. It was something that should be used by him to begin with.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, if everything were to go smoothly, Chu Feng would have subdued his world spirit with his own strength. This would be akin to an experience, an accomplishment, an extremely dazzling success.</p>
 <p>“In that case, it’s decided. Now, you should first learn that spirit formation,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“I actually learned it already,” Chu Feng patted his chest and said with confidence.</p>
 <p>“You learned it this quickly?” Eggy was shocked.</p>
 <p>“This Evil Spirit Binding Formation is actually virtually the same as the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation. If I had not grasped the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation, it would definitely have been extremely difficult to learn the Evil Spirit Binding Formation.”</p>
 <p>“However, I have not only learned the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation, I have even grasped it completely. Thus, learning the Evil Spirit Binding Formation was extremely easy,” Chu Feng explained with a smile.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case. In that case, it seems that you only lack Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. Even though speaking of it is easy, I doubt that they’ll be easy to find. In this period of time, you must frequently study that spirit formation in the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram that can increase your spirit power, so that you can become a Snake Mark Royal-level World Spiritist sooner.”</p>
 <p>“If you are able to become a Snake Mark Royal-level World Spiritist at the time when you obtain sufficient Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, you’ll be able to save a lot of time,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“As expected of Milady Queen, we’ve thought of the same thing again,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Someone’s coming. It’s someone from the Immortal Island. This Queen is not interested in greeting those old fellows. So, I’ll return first.” As Eggy spoke, she gracefully stepped into the world spirit gate.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, not long after Eggy entered the world spirit space, a white-clothed old man from the Immortal Island knocked on Chu Feng’s door.</p>
 <p>“Senior, is there something that you might need?” Chu Feng asked courteously.</p>
 <p>Even though this old man only possessed a status akin to that of a guard in the Immortal Island, it remained that he had a peak Half Martial Emperor cultivation, and strength on par with the Nine Powers’ headmasters. Logically, Chu Feng should show respect toward him.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, it’s time for dinner,” After the old man entered the house, he waved his sleeve toward the table. As light flickered, many plates of aromatic delicacies filled the table. Even though they were all vegetable dishes, they still appeared to be extremely delicious.</p>
 <p>“Senior, thank you for your trouble,” Chu Feng expressed his thanks. After that, he took a seat, held a bowl, and picked up the chopsticks to begin eating. However, he suddenly noticed that the old man was still standing there, and didn’t seem to have any intention of leaving. Thus, Chu Feng stood up with a smile and said, “Senior, have you eaten yet? Would you like to join me?”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, this old man has already eaten. Please eat your meal quickly so that I can take you to the Immortal Cultivation Lake afterward.”</p>
 <p>“Countless treasures are gathered in that Immortal Cultivation Lake. It was created with meticulous care and effort from the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. The effect it has toward helping one’s cultivation surpasses even the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds,” The old man said.</p>
 <p>“Wasn’t it said that we would be going there at night? The sky is still bright right now. Are we going there to make preparations to enter?” Chu Feng looked outside and saw that even though the sun was beginning to set, the sky was still very bright, and it was not yet the time to enter the Immortal Cultivation Lake.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, this is something that you’re misunderstanding. Even though the Immortal Cultivation Lake possesses even greater amounts of energy than the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds, there is a difference between them.”</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds have existed since the Ancient Era. The energies contained within them were capable of existing forever. However, the Immortal Cultivation Lake is not. The energies contained within the Immortal Cultivation Lake were obtained through refining rare treasures. Thus, it possesses limited energies. Its energies will decrease as cultivators refine and absorb the energies contained within it.”</p>
 <p>“In normal times, the Immortal Cultivation Lake is sealed. Other than the several times when Young Island Master occasionally enters, practically no one else has entered it. Thus, the energy contained within the Immortal Cultivation Lake is very abundant.”</p>
 <p>“However, today will be different. The number of people who have come here is not a small amount. Furthermore, many among them are geniuses among the younger generation. Likely, in less than ten days, all of the energies contained within the Immortal Cultivation Lake will be consumed.”</p>
 <p>“In this sort of situation, if one is able to enter it sooner, one would be able to train and absorb its energies for longer.”</p>
 <p>“That is why I wish to take little friend Chu Feng over sooner. When the seal of the Immortal Cultivation Lake is lifted, you can be the first one to enter, and obtain the greatest amount of possible benefit.” The old man spoke with a dull tone. Even though he was wearing a conical bamboo hat that covered his appearance, Chu Feng was able to sense that he had an amiable smile on his face.</p>
