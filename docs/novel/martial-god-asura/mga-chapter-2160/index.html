 <p><strong> Chapter 2160 - Terrifying Everyone</strong></p>
 <p>Upon seeing the silhouette on the ground, the crowd all blurted out together, “Ghostfiend Beast?!”</p>
 <p>They all managed to recognize that it was the Ghostfiend Beast that they had been painstakingly searching for.</p>
 <p>“D-d-did you kill it?” The robust man asked while looking at Chu Feng with an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>“Who else then? You?” Chu Feng sneered as he cast an eye at the robust man. Chu Feng had managed to return all the mockery from that robust man with merely that one sentence.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the robust man’s expression changed to one of awkwardness.</p>
 <p>After all, he knew very well that he would not be able to kill the Ghostfiend Beast with the strength that he possessed.</p>
 <p>“Wow, Chu Feng, aren’t you too powerful? Do you know how much effort we have put into capturing that Ghostfiend Beast? Even when senior Luo Tian and Luo Di encountered the Ghostfirend Beast, it still managed to escape from them multiple times.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ying had an excited expression. As for the Luo Tian and Luo Di that she spoke of, they were naturally the twin rank six Half Martial Ancestor-level old men.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” Hearing those words, the two brothers snorted coldly. Evidently, they were displeased by Tang Ying’s words.</p>
 <p>Then, that Luo Tian even said to Chu Feng, “Little friend, one must be honest.”</p>
 <p>“What are you implying?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“You know very well what I’m implying. You know very well that the Ghostfiend Beast is not only a rank four Half Martial Ancestor, it also possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation. Its true battle power is on par with rank six Half Martial Ancestors.”</p>
 <p>“As for you, you are merely a rank one Half Martial Ancestor. Although it is very inconceivable that you would be able to obtain that level of cultivation at your age, that is not a cultivation level where you can kill the Ghostfiend Beast.”</p>
 <p>“Tell the truth, who was it that killed the Ghostfiend Beast, and where did you manage to find the corpse of that Ghostfiend Beast?” Luo Tian asked with a cold tone. Earlier, he had completely disregarded Chu Feng. However, after Chu Feng took out that Ghostfiend Beast, he completely viewed Chu Feng as his enemy.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Although he is strong, that Ghostfiend Beast is stronger. It is impossible for him to have killed that Ghostfiend Beast,” At the same time, the others present also managed to react. One by one, they expressed their disbelief that Chu Feng had killed the Ghostfiend Beast.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng, who had been sitting on the ground, slowly stood up. He gently patted away the dust on his buttocks, and then began to walk toward the twin old men, Luo Tian and Luo Di.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng was less than two meters from the brothers, he stopped and said, “I collected this corpse in the Radiance Immortal Mountain. As for the person that killed that Ghostfiend Beast… he stands before you.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, little friend, it is truly not that I am looking down on you. Rather, your strength is clearly present before us. There is an enormous disparity between your strength and that of the Ghostfiend Beast.”</p>
 <p>“It is not that us two brothers do not believe you. Instead, go and ask the crowd present; who would possibly believe you?” Luo Tian and Luo Di burst into loud laughter. Their laughter was filled with mockery.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…” Following their laughter, the people from the Tang Family that had arrived late all burst into loud laughter.</p>
 <p>“Zzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, lightning flashed in Chu Feng’s eyes. When the Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared, Chu Feng’s aura increased from rank one Half Martial Ancestor to rank three Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Immediately after that, a loud ‘bang’ was heard as a powerful oppressive might swept forth from within Chu Feng. That oppressive might directly smashed toward Luo Tian and Luo Di.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that they were so close to one another, and Chu Feng’s oppressive might was so powerful, the two old men were directly struck by Chu Feng’s oppressive might, and knocked several meters away before they even managed to react.</p>
 <p>“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”</p>
 <p>Like arrows shot out from a bow, the two aged bodies were shot forth explosively. They pierced through all the boulders and trees that they crashed into, leaving a complete mess behind them.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, the two old men were still knocked several hundred thousands of meters away before crashing to a stop.</p>
 <p>“Heavens!!!”</p>
 <p>This sudden scene caused everyone to open their mouths wide with shock. When the crowd looked back to Chu Feng, not to mention the others, even the robust man who had looked down on Chu Feng earlier revealed a very serious expression.</p>
 <p>After all, those two old men were actual rank six Half Martial Ancestors. However, they were knocked flying by Chu Feng’s oppressive might.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings on Chu Feng’s body astonished the crowd even more.</p>
 <p>While no one recognized Chu Feng’s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings in the Holy Land of Martialism, this was not true in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Practically everyone knew that the Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, as well as that heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, were the symbols of people from Heavenly Clans. They were abilities that only the wielders of Heavenly Bloodlines possessed.</p>
 <p>How powerful were the Heavenly Clans? In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, all of the Heavenly Clans were huge monsters ruling over a region.</p>
 <p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that regardless of how powerful the Tang Family might be, when compared to Heavenly Clans, they would be nothing more than little brooks against vast seas; they were simply incapable.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of that that the people from the Tang Family were this startled. Not to mention Chu Feng’s heaven-defying battle power, merely his background was already capable of terrifying them endlessly.</p>
 <p>At this moment, many of the people from the Tang Family were already shivering in fear with their legs gone soft.</p>
 <p>After all, they had planned to kill Chu Feng earlier. Yet, he was someone from a Heavenly Clan, someone that they could not afford to offend.</p>
 <p>“Bastard brat! Today, this old man shall dismember your body to ten thousand pieces!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a roar filled with overwhelming anger sounded. At the same time, boundless killing intent swept forth, covering this region.</p>
 <p>It was the twin old men, Luo Tian and Luo Di. They were rapidly rushing over. Before they even arrive, their voices and killing intents have already arrived.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng’s oppressive might had beaten them back, he had merely beaten them back, and not really injured them.</p>
 <p>Thus, although they might not be completely uninjured, they had only suffered light wounds.</p>
 <p>However, to be knocked flying by a member of the younger generation, and for it to have been done before their employers on top of that, caused the two old men to feel completely humiliated. As such, they wanted to teach Chu Feng a lesson.</p>
 <p>“If you wish to fight, I do not mind. However, let me tell you this beforehand. I do not have the time to bother with you. If you insist on making me fight, I will do so with the intention to kill,” Chu Feng spoke coldly. At the same time, intense killing intent emerged in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“What an arrogant brat. You dare boast this shamelessly? Very well, let us experience what abilities you might possess. We shall see how you will kill us.”</p>
 <p>The voices of Luo Tian and Luo Di sounded once again. At this moment, their voices did not sound from afar. Instead, they had already approached Chu Feng, and were in his and the crowd’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>“That is?!!!”</p>
 <p>However, when they saw the current Chu Feng, Luo Tian and Luo Di were immediately stunned, as if they had been petrified.</p>
 <p>Not only did the two men immediately retrieve their overwhelming killing intent, the two of them also revealed astonished and terrified expressions.</p>
 <p>Someone from a Heavenly Clan. If the Tang Family feared them, then the two brothers also feared them.</p>
 <p>“Puu,” Seeing this scene, Tang Ying hurriedly covered her mouth with her hand. She had nearly burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>While Luo Tian and Luo Di were people that they had hired using a great amount of wealth, those two old farts were extremely arrogant. They could be said to consider everyone beneath themselves. Those two old farts would refuse to even look at her and her third brother face-to-face.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, after the two old men saw Chu Feng, they actually revealed gazes of fear.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the two old men had been shouting that they would teach Chu Feng a lesson, that they would dismember Chu Feng to ten thousand pieces. Yet, at this moment, they were filled with cowardice. The way Tang Ying saw it, this was simply too funny.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Why aren’t you attacking me?” Chu Feng said without a trace of politeness.</p>
 <p>“I…” The brothers Luo Tian and Luo Di were at a loss as to what to say. However, they did not dare to say anything like teaching Chu Feng a lesson again.</p>
 <p>Humiliating. Even without others pointing it out, Luo Tian and Luo Di both knew that they had been humiliated right now.</p>
 <p>However, there was nothing they could do about it. After all, the two of them truly did not dare to offend the people of the Heavenly Clans.</p>
