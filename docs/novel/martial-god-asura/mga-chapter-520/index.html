 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 520 - Middle-Aged Man</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Azure Dragon, that old thing is truly looking to die. Why not go give him a lesson right now?” Hearing the mad loud laughter coming from the Ji Dynasty’s old ancestor afar, the Monstrous Monkey King was the first to be unable to accept it. He knew that if the Azure Dragon Founder wanted to kill the Ji Dynasty’s old ancestor, it was only a matter of flicking his finger. So, that was why he asked the Azure Dragon Founder to make his move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, that chariot is too strange.” However, the Azure Dragon Founder didn’t pay attention to the Ji Dynasty’s old ancestor who was escaping, but locked his gaze dead on the chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And after hearing his words, everyone noticed the chariot that stopped in mid-air, and couldn’t help locking their gazes onto the small-scale palace above the chariot as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*creak~~~*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the door to the small-scale palace opened. At that instant, everyone’s heartbeat couldn’t help racing a bit faster, and their gazes also became extremely serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what they didn’t expect was that after the palace door was opened, it was actually an old man who walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That old man’s age was too high. If he wasn’t eighty, he was ninety, but his cultivation wasn’t too strong, being only in the 1st level of the Heaven realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after the old man walked out, only then did everyone discover that he was pulling a person out with his hand. It was a middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man wore gorgeous clothing and had a large stature. Black hair went straight to his heel, fluttered with the wind, and he was elegant and unordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, his thick brows and big eyes looked very handsome and brave. However, a middle-aged man like him who had such an unordinary appearance didn’t have the slightest bit of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did he not have cultivation, even his mental state didn’t seem to be too clear. At that moment, despite already walking in front of the chariot, he didn’t even look straight at the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With dull eyes and a face filled with an idiotic smile, he munched the two roasted chicken in his hands. He ate like a wolf swallowing and tiger gulping, and was in extreme joy, as if he hadn’t eaten in a hundred years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t it right? What kind of joke is this? Just an old man like him, and an idiot, is his so-called secret weapon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, it was just for scaring people. The Ji Dynasty’s old ancestor is truly funny. Hahaha...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they carefully examined the two people at the front of the chariot, their originally tense hearts all calmed. Moreover, they started to loudly laugh mockingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, from them, it could be said that they didn’t feel the slightest bit of threat. The old man was only in the 1st level of the Heaven realm. Too many people on scene could easily kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the middle-aged man, although he had an unordinary and handsome appearance, he was clearly an idiot. Furthermore, an idiot without cultivation, so most people didn’t put the two of them in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person looks very familiar.” However, as the crowd relaxed, Chu Feng became even more uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, when the two of them appeared, Chu Feng concentration fully onto the middle-aged man. For some reason, he felt that the man was a bit familiar, yet he couldn’t remember where he saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the Azure Dragon Founder also carefully examined the middle-aged man. Although he didn’t discover any inklings, his gaze was also filled with alert, always feeling that the middle-aged man was not simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the old man made his move. He didn’t attack the people from the Jiang Dynasty, but extended his hand towards the middle-aged man next to him, and used his hand to brush the long hair on his forehead to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is bad! Ancestor, quickly stop that old man, do not let him touch his forehead!” At that instant, Chu Feng’s pupils shrunk, his face changed greatly, and he hurriedly loudly yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, when the middle-aged man’s long hair above his forehead was pushed to the side, Chu Feng understood everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the forehead of the man, he saw a scar. A scar that was vivid, lifelike, and like flames. Chu Feng had seen that scar before. He had seen it on the forehead of a beggar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And back then, Chu Feng almost got killed because he touched the scar on the beggar’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Chu Feng finally knew why the man looked so familiar. It was because he was the beggar from back then. The man who carried Chu Feng to the Chu family, and instructed Chu Yuan, telling him that he must raise Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng always wanted to see him again, because even though he knew that his mind was muddled, after all, he was his only hope in knowing where he came from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But currently, seeing him again, Chu Feng did not feel any joy. What he had was only endless fear because he knew how terrifying that man was after being enraged. If he truly exploded, it was likely that the entire Jiang Dynasty would be flattened by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Although he didn’t know why Chu Feng was that nervous, the Azure Dragon Founder still felt that something was wrong so he explosively yelled, flicked his fly whisk, and instantly, berserk power engulfed outwards. With light-like speed, it pressed towards the old man and the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Azure Dragon Founder’s strike was not only for stopping the old man’s action. It was to completely destroy the old man and the middle-aged man, including the chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had to be said that the Azure Dragon Founder’s strength was indeed very powerful. Almost in the moment the old man’s palm was going to touch the man’s forehead scar, his attack arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the deafening explosion, the area that the chariot was at instantly became chaos. Layers and layers of wild ripples kept on surging everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did it cause more and more cracks to form in the air, even the continuous structures on the ground were shattered from the shock. The Azure Dragon Founder’s strike was too fierce, and even some people from the Jiang Dynasty were dragged in by that, dying within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that more greatly showed the Azure Dragon Founder’s nervousness. He did indeed feel danger from the middle-aged man, and was also aware that the old man’s action was dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, that was why he didn’t restrain himself on that strike and harmed some innocent people because in the instant just now, he only wanted to stop the old man’s action and remove two uneasy, hidden troubles. He simply didn’t consider the safety of the people underneath the chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*wuaoo~~~~~~~~~~~~~*</span></p>
 <p><span style>But just as the layers of ripples were spreading, suddenly, a wild hurricane swept over. The hurricane was really too intense. It actually engulfed the horrifying ripple instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And very quickly, the hurricane also disappeared. At that instant, the almost shattered sky returned to silence once again. Simultaneously, a figure also came into view, appearing in the crowd’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the middle-aged man stood on air. His long hair fluttered, and his eyes no longer had their lifelessness from before. Replacing them were two endlessly rising flames of fury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes that were filled with flames of fury were really too terrifying. So terrifying that with a single glance, from deep inside one’s heart, strong fear spread outwards, engulfing their entire body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap. Although his strike successfully killed the old man, and even left nothing behind from killing the several Monstrous Beasts and the chariot, it also thoroughly stirred up this person’s anger.” At that instant, Chu Feng tightly frowned because he had seen how horrifying that person was in his mad times, and he had also heard, from Chu Yuan, how horrifying the strength that person grasped was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That very instant was when his strength was fully shown. In his psychotic state, they were likely going to be facing a disaster.</span></p>
