 <p><strong>Chapter 2719 - Going All-Out</strong></p>
 <p>“You’re courting death!” Chu Xianshuo shouted.</p>
 <p>Then, together with his giant sword formation, he soared into the air and began to fly toward Chu Feng to thrust at him.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng continued to stand there, completely motionless.</p>
 <p>Yet, there was a sort of expression that filled Chu Feng’s gaze.</p>
 <p>It was an expression of confidence.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>A loud sound was heard. That giant sword had collided with Chu Feng’s defensive formation.</p>
 <p>The powerful might of the sword immediately gave rise to an energy ripple. Like a cyclone, the energy ripple swept across and caused the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations, as well as the other bystanders, to roll and crawl on the ground.</p>
 <p>There were even people that were struck to a state of being seriously injured, and started to vomit blood because of the energy ripple.</p>
 <p>However, even with such a ferocious attack from that giant sword, Chu Feng’s defensive formation remained completely undamaged.</p>
 <p>Even though that giant sword was extremely powerful, it was still unable to pierce through Chu Feng’s defensive formation.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>Seeing such a scene, Chu Xianshuo revealed a stunned expression. Astonishment filled his eyes.</p>
 <p>It was not only him. The people outside the hunting ground that bore witness to it were also deeply astonished.</p>
 <p>If even the spirit formation Chu Xianshuo set up after using forbidden world spirit medicines was unable to breach Chu Feng’s defensive formation, exactly how powerful was Chu Feng’s defensive formation?</p>
 <p>At the moment when everyone was astonished, Chu Feng said, “It is time to settle this.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng said those words while looking at Chu Xianshuo. From such a close distance, Chu Xianshuo was able to clearly see one expression from Chu Feng’s gaze.</p>
 <p>Contempt!!!</p>
 <p>“You damned bastard!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng was actually looking down on him in such a manner, Chu Xianshuo was so furious that he was about to explode in rage.</p>
 <p>He shouted loudly, and then unleashed another attack toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, a special sort of light flickered in Chu Feng’s eyes.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Feng clenched his palms together. He was making a hand seal.</p>
 <p>Then, he shouted, “Break!!!”</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~~”</p>
 <p>The next moment, a loud sound was heard. Chu Feng’s defensive formation emitted enormous power.</p>
 <p>The power emitted by the defensive formation was so strong that even Chu Xianshuo’s giant sword formation was instantly split apart and then shattered to pieces.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Xianshuo was also knocked flying. By the time he landed on the ground, his body was already covered in blood.</p>
 <p>Chu Xianshuo was seriously injured. Even his aura had grown much weaker.</p>
 <p>“Impossible! Impossible! This is impossible!!!”</p>
 <p>“I refuse to believe that I’d be defeated by you!!!”</p>
 <p>However, even though he was already seriously injured, Chu Xianshuo’s state of mind was extremely unstable.</p>
 <p>He refused to believe that he had been defeated; so utterly defeated.</p>
 <p>“I know that you are unwilling to accept it.”</p>
 <p>“It’s alright, I will convince you. Truth be told, I had really not planned to go all-out against someone like you.”</p>
 <p>“After all, you are truly unqualified for me to do such a thing.”</p>
 <p>“However, today, I will make an exception. I will have you know the disparity between you and I.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng spoke, he removed the defensive formation before him and began to set up another spirit formation.</p>
 <p>This time around, Chu Feng took a bit longer to set up his spirit formation compared to last time. However, it was merely a bit longer. Compared to the time Chu Xianshuo took to set up his spirit formation, Chu Feng’s time could be said to be very short.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Finally, as light flickered about, a boundless spirit formation appeared before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That spirit formation was roughly a hundred meters in size. It was glistening with light, and resembled an enormous egg.</p>
 <p>“Snap~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a strange sound was heard. The next moment, that spirit formation suddenly opened.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Once that spirit formation opened, roars began to be heard nonstop. The roars shook the earth and rocked the mountains.</p>
 <p>At the same time, countless silhouettes began to fly out from the spirit formation and rush into the sky.</p>
 <p>Originally, those silhouettes were very small. They were the size of raindrops. However, once they arrived in the sky, they started to rapidly increase in size.</p>
 <p>In merely the blink of an eye, they all turned into huge monsters that were over a hundred meters in size.</p>
 <p>It turned out that those silhouettes were all ferocious beasts. Those ferocious beasts were all wearing armor, and looked very fiendish.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, their auras were extremely robust and strong. Each and every one of them possessed auras surpassing the giant sword formation Chu Xianshuo had set up.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, such ferocious giant creatures numbered in the tens of thousands. At this moment, they were standing in the sky in orderly rows. It was like an army of giant creatures.</p>
 <p>Their numbers were so numerous that they hid the entire sky and covered the earth below. It was a truly frightening sight.</p>
 <p>Seeing those ferocious giant creatures, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all so scared that they started to shiver in fear. None of them dared to raise their heads.</p>
 <p>Not only were the women crying tears of fear, but even the men were crying tears of fear.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were scared.</p>
 <p>At that moment, fear also appeared in Chu Xianshuo’s eyes.</p>
 <p>He had grown quiet. The reason for that was because those giant creatures were all so ferocious-looking. Furthermore, their murderous gazes were all aimed at him.</p>
 <p>Chu Xianshuo was scared. He was truly scared that Chu Feng would kill him.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! How could that Chu Feng be so powerful?!”</p>
 <p>“How was he able to set up such a powerful spirit formation in such a short period of time?!”</p>
 <p>“That is an actual slaughtering formation. He was actually capable of setting up such a powerful slaughtering formation so easily?!”</p>
 <p>“A genius world spiritist! He is a genius world spiritist!”</p>
 <p>“A genius like him would not come by in ten thousand years!”</p>
 <p>“No, not ten thousand years, it’s a hundred thousand years!”</p>
 <p>“A genius like him would rarely even appear in a hundred thousand years!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd outside the hunting ground had burst into an utter uproar.</p>
 <p>The younger generations were all astonished by what Chu Feng did. Adoration and admiration filled their eyes.</p>
 <p>As for the experts, their eyes were filled with shock.</p>
 <p>It was only at that moment that they realized how powerful Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>Firstly, Chu Xianshuo’s world spirit techniques were most definitely not weak among Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.</p>
 <p>Otherwise, he would not have been able to obtain first place in the hunt nine times in a row.</p>
 <p>But even though they were both Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, Chu Xianshuo had to take forbidden world spirit medicines in order to set up his powerful giant sword formation. Yet, his giant sword formation was completely no match for a spirit formation that Chu Feng had casually set up.</p>
 <p>The disparity in strength between them was simply self-evident. It was simply too enormous.</p>
 <p>It was precisely such a disparity that allowed the crowd to realize how unreasonably powerful Chu Feng’s attainments in world spirit techniques were.</p>
 <p>After all, judging from his age, Chu Feng was much younger than Chu Xianshuo.</p>
 <p>“Lord Villa Master, could it be that Chu Feng…?” The fiery red-haired old man looked to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.</p>
 <p>“It’s as you thought. Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques are already at the apex of Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.”</p>
 <p>“That child is only a fine line away from becoming a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“A Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? Such a young Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? I don’t believe there has ever been such a young Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, no?”</p>
 <p>The fiery red-haired old man had a face filled with astonishment. In a place like the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were not rare.</p>
 <p>However, a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist at an age like Chu Feng’s was something that had never appeared before.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng was truly capable of becoming a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it would be a stunning matter for the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have imagined that Chu Feng to be such a genius. It is no wonder he’s that confident.”</p>
 <p>The fiery red-haired old man had modified his previous remarks. He no longer thought Chu Feng to be arrogant and conceited. Instead, he felt that Chu Feng was confident.</p>
 <p>Confident. Indeed, it was confidence.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng wasn’t confident in being able to suppress Chu Xianshuo, he would not have allowed Chu Xianshuo to do whatever he wanted.</p>
