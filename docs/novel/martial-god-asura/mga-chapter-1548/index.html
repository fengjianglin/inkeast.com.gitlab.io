 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1548 - Overlord Domain</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior Yan, you said that you were controlled by someone? Who could have controlled you?”</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng asked. Disbelief filled his eyes. It was not only Dugu Xingfeng who was acting like this. Chu Feng and the others also found this matter to be extremely unimaginable.</p>
 <p>If someone of Chu Feng’s cultivation was controlled by another, it would be excusable. However, the Yan Clan’s Ancestor was a Martial Emperor. For even someone like him to be controlled, in that case… how powerful and frightening must the person who controlled him be?</p>
 <p>“I do not know who it was. However, I am certain that person is very powerful. At the very least, that person would be a rank three Martial Emperor. Else, it would impossible for my consciousness to be suppressed in an instant, for him to take over my body and use the techniques he has grasped with my body,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.</p>
 <p>“Rank three Martial Emperor?” Hearing those words, Dugu Xingfeng and the others were all shocked. Their expressions all became very serious.</p>
 <p>One must know that the Nine Powers generally only possessed three to five Martial Emperors each.</p>
 <p>As for the strongest individuals of the Nine Powers, existences on the level of the Sacred Assemblies’ Assembly Masters, they were all only rank two Martial Emperors. It was precisely because of this that the Nine Powers were able to maintain an equilibrium.</p>
 <p>Although it was possible that there would be people among the nine Assembly Masters who had managed to become rank three Martial Emperors, it was only a possibility.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this moment, an actual rank three Martial Emperor had appeared. That Martial Emperor had noticed all of their movements and conduct, and had even borrowed the Yan Clan’s Ancestor’s body to warn the people of the Cursed Soil Sect.</p>
 <p>However, in actuality, it was that unknown Martial Emperor that had saved them. If it hadn’t been for that person, it was likely that the Yan Clan’s Ancestor would have ended up dying at the hands of the Cursed Soil Sect.</p>
 <p>“Who exactly was that person? Why did he save us?”</p>
 <p>Everyone present were intelligent people. They knew that the person who had controlled the Yan Clan’s Ancestor had had good intentions. Else, he would not have saved them, and would not have placed the blame of killing the Cursed Soil Seven onto himself.</p>
 <p>Merely, they were curious as to exactly who it was that could help them for no reason. Furthermore, that person was such a powerful individual.</p>
 <p>“The Holy Land of Martialism is a place with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Without mentioning the Three Palaces, Four Clans and Nine Powers or those grand famous characters, the unknown experts are also very numerous.”</p>
 <p>“Even though the Cursed Soil Domain is merely a remote land, a place with scarce natural resources, in this vast Holy Land of Martialism, who would be able to guarantee that there are no hidden Martial Emperors in this place?”</p>
 <p>“For the sake of their own selfishness, the Cursed Soil Sect has willingly slaughtered the innocent. They are truly devoid of conscience. What they’ve done is something that everyone would wish to put an end to. It is also normal for there to be someone who was unable to continue watching and acted to give them a warning.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, no matter who that person might be, he should be a righteous individual. At the very least, his current conduct is only beneficial and not detrimental to us. Even though my consciousness has been injured, I have, nevertheless, managed to keep my life. Thus, we must thank that individual,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the others nodded in agreement. Thus, they stopped speculating about the identity of the person that had assisted them.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I’m going to bury my adoptive father here,” Tantai Xue walked over. At this moment, she was no longer crying. She had also wiped away the tears that covered her face. However, her eyes remained red. From this, it could be seen that she was still feeling extremely pained.</p>
 <p>“Bury him here?” Chu Feng was a bit surprised. This place could truly be considered to be a desolate mountain. It was a very unsafe location.</p>
 <p>Tantai Yingming was a peak Half Martial Emperor. His source energy and even his corpse were precious treasures.</p>
 <p>If someone were to discover his corpse, it was likely that it would be snatched away. Thus, it was very inappropriate to bury Tantai Yingming here.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Tantai, what do you think about burying your adoptive father in our Cyanwood Mountain?” Dugu Xingfeng said.</p>
 <p>“Senior Dugu, thank you for your kind intentions. However, my adoptive father has said before that he wished to be buried where he died. He has walked a very long journey in his life. I do not wish to have him travel even after death. Allow me to bury him here,” Tantai Xue insisted.</p>
 <p>“Very well, I’ll help you,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Tantai Xue did not refuse Chu Feng’s help and instead nodded.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the spirit formation that had concealed this region was dissolved. It was the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, he had removed the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, find a good location. I believe you know what to do,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master said.</p>
 <p>“This disciple understands,” Chu Feng left with Tantai Xue. He then began to use his Heaven’s Eyes to inspect the mountain they were on. Finally, he found a good location suitable to bury Tantai Yingming.</p>
 <p>Not only was this location very hidden, it also possessed great feng shui. It was truly a great location to bury the dead.</p>
 <p>After finding this location, Tantai Xue did not use her world spirit techniques to quickly create a grave. Rather, she used her own hands to personally dig a grave.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng also extended his hand to help Tantai Xue dig the grave.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Tantai Xue raised her head and asked, “Chu Feng, why did you help me?” A complicated expression was flickering in her clear eyes.</p>
 <p>“Because you helped me before,” Chu Feng replied.</p>
 <p>“I helped you back then because I was the one who brought forth the calamity. I merely did not wish to implicate you all with the calamity that I created.”</p>
 <p>“As for you, you helped me because you felt that you owed me. Is that why, even though you’re tens of thousand of miles away, you still insisted on coming to save me? Is it all so that you do not have to owe me anything anymore?” Tantai Xue asked.</p>
 <p>“No,” Chu Feng shook his head, “I helped you because I consider you to be my friend. Perhaps you might feel that my debt has been settled by me helping you. However, if there is a next time and a next time on top of that, as long as you need me, I will help you unconditionally.”</p>
 <p>“Remember, what flows between friends is friendship. In this world, there are not many things more important than friendship. Thus, I helped you without seeking anything. However, it is also not without an intention. My intention in helping you is for you to be well,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Tantai Xue’s face grew a bit stiff, and a change appeared in her beautiful eyes. Then, she grew silent, lowered her head and began to continue to use her lily-white hands to dig at the hard soil. However, regardless of how hard the soil might be, before her, it was soft as water.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she and Chu Feng had dug very deep. However, they continued to dig. They planned to bury Tantai Yingming even deeper.</p>
 <p>“What’re your plans after this?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I plan to go to the Overlord Domain,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“Overlord Domain?” Chu Feng was startled to hear those words. Having been to the Holy Land of Martialism for so long, Chu Feng naturally knew of the Overlord Domain.</p>
 <p>The Holy Land of Martialism was very large. However, due to its boundary energy, it was separated into many domains. There were domains occupied by humans and domains not occupied by humans. However, undoubtedly, the Overlord Domain was the most vast and prosperous domain in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>The Overlord Domain was located in the center of the Holy Land of Martialism. It occupied an area over several tens of times the areas that the Nine Powers occupied.</p>
 <p>The Overlord Domain was the domain where the Dongfang Imperial Clan, Ximen Imperial Clan, Beitang Imperial Clan and Nangong Imperial Clan were located.</p>
 <p>The Overlord Domain was the domain where the Mortal King Palace, the Underworld Palace and the Heavenly Law Palace were located.</p>
 <p>The Overlord Domain was also the domain where the core of the Ancient Era’s Elves, the Elf Kingdom, was located.</p>
 <p>The Overlord Domain was the domain with the greatest amount of experts in the Holy Land of Martialism. Yet, it was also the domain that was hardest to survive in within the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>If one were to go there without sufficient strength, one would only be humiliated and tormented to death by others.</p>
 <p>However, if one wished to become powerful, that would be the domain that one must go to. If one wished to become an emperor, a king, an overlord, one could only accomplish that by going there.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, come with me,” Suddenly, Tantai Xue said. She actually invited Chu Feng to journey together with her.</p>
