 <p><strong> Chapter 2526 - Power Awakening</strong></p>
 <p>At that moment, Wang Qiang’s body seemed to have doubled in size. His skin was distorting and wriggling nonstop.</p>
 <p>It was as if something was about to emerge from within his body.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Wang Qiang’s body was also emitting a faint glow.</p>
 <p>This faint glow was slightly strange. Even though it was very faint, one could tell upon closer inspection that it was composed of four different colors.</p>
 <p>They were green, blue, red and purple.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, apart from the radiance, there was also a sort of gaseous flame that surrounded Wang Qiang together with the light. Those gaseous flames were also green, blue, red and purple.</p>
 <p>It was as if flames were rising from Wang Qiang’s body.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what happened to Wang Qiang?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that the poison has been removed?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was panicky. He was unable to determine exactly what was happening with Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s not poison. I’ve already removed that poison. The change to Wang Qiang right now is indeed somewhat strange.”</p>
 <p>“However, you all actually do not have to worry about it. What’s happening to him is not something bad but something good,” Suddenly, the Golden Crane True Immortal removed his serious expression and revealed a faint smile.</p>
 <p>It was as if he had been deliberately pretending with that serious expression he wore before, that he was toying with Chu Feng and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>“Good thing?” Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were confused.</p>
 <p>“Wang Qiang’s current appearance seems more like some sort of hidden power within him is awakening,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Some sort of hidden power within him is awakening?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were both shocked. Then, they were overjoyed.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because if the power hidden within Wang Qiang were to awaken, then it would most likely increase Wang Qiang’s strength. To Wang Qiang, this would indeed be something good.</p>
 <p>“However, exactly what sort of power is this? Could it be Divine Power?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Something like this is hard to tell. For some, it might be because their Inherited Bloodline has been sealed. For others, it might be that their Divine Power was sealed.”</p>
 <p>“However, regardless of which it might be, it remains a good thing for Wang Qiang. Thus, the two of you do not have to worry too much,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, is this sort of seal man-made?” Chu Feng wanted to know whether or not someone had sealed Wang Qiang’s power.</p>
 <p>“That’s hard to say. It might be possible that someone did the sealing, and it might also be possible that it was caused by some sort of unforeseen event.”</p>
 <p>“Since his power is automatically awakening, it is very possible that his hidden power sealed itself.”</p>
 <p>“If it was sealed by someone, how could the seal be undone this easily?” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“What senior says is very true,” Hearing what the Golden Crane True Immortal said, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>If the sealing of Wang Qiang’s power was not man-made, then it would mean that Wang Qiang did not have some sort of enemy that sealed his power.</p>
 <p>However, there was no such thing as an absolute. Even if the sealing wasn’t man-made, it could not be said with certainty that Wang Qiang did not have enemies.</p>
 <p>After all, as long as his power was sealed, this meant that he must’ve encountered something in the past.</p>
 <p>“My husband is truly exceptional. His talents were already this amazing even before his power completely awakened. If his power is to completely awaken, wouldn’t he be even more powerful?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, I truly want to see exactly what my husband’s awakening power will be like.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hong was overjoyed. As Wang Qiang’s lover, she would naturally be more happy than others to see her husband receiving such a fortunate opportunity.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a roar suddenly sounded from within Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>That roar was extremely strange. The moment it was heard, Chu Feng immediately felt a shiver all over.</p>
 <p>Precisely because that voice was so frightening, Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and the Golden Crane True Immortal all involuntarily took two steps back.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng looked at Zhao Hong and the Golden Crane True Immortal, and discovered that they had the same reaction as him.</p>
 <p>It was one thing for Zhao Hong to have the same sort of reaction as him. However, the Golden Crane True Immortal was a renowned individual from an Upper Realm. Yet, even his expression changed upon hearing that roar.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what’s happening to my husband? Why would there be a beast roaring from within his body? Furthermore, that roar was so terrifying.”</p>
 <p>“Are you certain that it is his power that is about to awaken, and not some sort of monster sealed within him?” Zhao Hong asked nervously.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because she had discovered that not only was Wang Qiang’s body emitting that strange roar, but the dark purple radiance on his body was also growing stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>“Move back immediately.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal waved his sleeve and brought Chu Feng and Zhao Hong behind him.</p>
 <p>He had moved to the edge of the palace hall with Chu Feng and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>Then, he set up a spirit formation to seal Wang Qiang within it.</p>
 <p>That spirit formation was very large, and was composed of many layers of spirit formations. It was a very powerful sealing formation.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what are you doing?” Seeing this scene, Zhao Hong started to panic even more.</p>
 <p>She was panicky because she was worried that some sort of monster was sealed in Wang Qiang’s body, a monster that could end up taking Wang Qiang’s life.</p>
 <p>Among them, the Golden Crane True Immortal would be the person with the greatest capability of saving Wang Qiang’s life.</p>
 <p>However, not only did the Golden Crane True Immortal not do anything to save Wang Qiang’s life, he instead set up such a powerful sealing formation to seal Wang Qiang within it. She felt that he was simply abandoning Wang Qiang. As such, how could Zhao Hong not be panicky?</p>
 <p>“Zhao Hong, you don’t have to worry. It is most definitely some sort of power awakening from within Wang Qiang. Thus, his life will not be in danger. Instead, it is us, the bystanders, that need to be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Judging from things now, regardless of what sort of power Wang Qiang’s awakening power might be, it is very powerful.”</p>
 <p>“I fear that power will be enormously ferocious once it is completely awakened,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Hearing those words, Zhao Hong’s mouth opened slightly. Joy emerged in her eyes. According to what the Golden Crane True Immortal had said, this was most definitely a good thing.</p>
 <p>Not only would Wang Qiang obtain a new power, but this power was also extremely strong.</p>
 <p>“Senior, there are four different beast roars coming from Wang Qiang’s body. Could it be that there are four ferocious beasts within his body?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Four different beast roars?” Zhao Hong was surprised. She had felt that the roars were all the same.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, your hearing is very good. Indeed, there are four different beasts roaring right now. Thus… it might be possible that Wang Qiang is a person from a Monstrous Clan, and his body contains some sort of Monstrous Bloodline,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“A person from a Monstrous Clan, is it?” Chu Feng’s expression changed. Although he was surprised, he was able to accept it.</p>
 <p>After all, Wang Qiang’s origins were a mystery. Although he appeared to be a human the entire time, if his Monstrous Bloodline was sealed, it would be natural for him to be unable to take a Monstrous Beast form or emit a Monstrous Beast’s aura.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the four roars grew even more resounding and distinctive.</p>
 <p>Those were indeed roars from four different beasts. Furthermore, their roars were extremely frightening. One would feel fear from one’s heart upon hearing those roars.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, heaven and earth started to shake violently. It was as if Wang Qiang’s body had exploded.</p>
 <p>A dark purple radiance and dark purple gaseous flames filled the entire spirit formation that sealed Wang Qiang within.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong’s hearts tightened. They were both afraid that something might happen to Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>However, through seeing with his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng’s suspended heart was lifted.</p>
 <p>Wang Qiang was still present within the spirit formation. Not only was he completely unscathed, but his body was also emitting a purple radiance.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Wang Qiang’s body had returned to its original size. It was also no longer distorted or twitching. It was as if Wang Qiang had returned to normal.</p>
 <p>Although Wang Qiang was fine, Chu Feng once again revealed an extremely astonished expression.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because four enormous ferocious beasts were standing around Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>Those four ferocious beasts were respectively green, red, blue and purple.</p>
 <p>They were each over a hundred meters tall and several hundred meters long. Those were four actual colossuses.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, although those four ferocious beasts had different appearances, they were all extremely fierce-looking, and possessed sharp fangs.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had seen many frightening things in his life. However, it was the first time Chu Feng had ever seen ferocious beasts as frightening as the four before him.</p>
 <p>If the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise were four Divine Beasts from the heavens...</p>
 <p>Then, the four ferocious beasts surrounding Wang Qiang resembled Demonic Beasts from hell.</p>
 <p>Not only were they extremely ugly in appearance, but their auras were also ice-cold, dark and fierce.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, even though a spirit formation was separating them, Chu Feng was still able to sense the might of the four ferocious beasts. They were so powerful that even Chu Feng’s hairs started to stand on end.</p>
 <p>However, to Chu Feng’s joy, regardless of how fierce and frightening the four ferocious beasts were, they did not seem to have any intention of harming Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>Instead, they seemed to be guarding Wang Qiang.</p>
