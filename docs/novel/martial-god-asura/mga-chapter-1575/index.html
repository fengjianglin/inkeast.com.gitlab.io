 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1575 - Dreadful Heart For Self Interest</strong></p>
 <p>“You have some sort of conflict with the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts?” After hearing what Chu Feng said, Tantai Xue revealed a gaze of worry.</p>
 <p>“I don’t. Merely, I have come across Monstrous Dragon Beasts before, and felt that they were very powerful. However, I’ve heard that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts are even stronger. That is why I wish to see them for myself,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“It’s good as long as there’s no conflict between you and them. The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts are not beings that one can provoke as one wishes. It’s best that you don’t provoke them either,” Tantai Xue felt relieved.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I would not go and provoke them for no reason, I am not so bored to do such a thing,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s right. There’s another piece of important news. Su Rou and Zi Ling were here. However, I did not see them. But, those who came here before me said that they had seen two extremely beautiful women. Based on their appearances, I think they are Su Rou and Zi Ling,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“I got it. In that case, it would seem that they left for the Immortal Island before us?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Mn, they have already left. Merely, I do not know whether their journey is going smoothly or not. Other than that, the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan have joined together and formed an advance party. That party has already left to survey the path ahead. I believe they will be returning here soon,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that it is truly difficult to reach the Immortal Island,” Chu Feng laughed bitterly. Even though he already knew that he would have to undergo trials by participating in this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly, the trials here were even more difficult than he’d imagined them to be.</p>
 <p>“Miss Tantai, is there any other information that you managed to obtain?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes. There is a stone platform on this island. However, that stone platform appears to be a very unnecessary construction. I don’t know whether it might have any special implication. How about you go and have a look at it?” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“Okay, lead me there,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s right. Chu Feng, there’s another thing,” Tantai Xue suddenly said.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s better that you call me by my name directly,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“Call you by your name directly? Okay, is it fine for me to address you as Lil’ Xue?” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xue’s beautiful eyebrows creased. She seemed to be displeased. However, she did not say anything.</p>
 <p>“You don’t like it? In that case, what about Xue’er?” Chu Feng asked again.</p>
 <p>“Do whatever you wish. It’ll be fine as long as you do not keep calling me Miss Tantai. We are of the same generation. For you to address me as such makes me feel extremely weird.” After Tantai Xue finished saying those words, she took the lead and left.</p>
 <p>Following Tantai Xue, Chu Feng soon ran into a group of people. It was a group of young people. There were both men and women. They all had very decent appearances. However, they were, to be exact, not humans. That was because they all had a sharp horn growing out of their foreheads. The horns looked like rhinoceros horns. However, those horns were much sharper than rhinoceros horns and they contained a very strong power. In fact, even their auras were different. They were emitting monstrous auras.</p>
 <p>It was clear that they were the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. Sure enough, these King Monstrous Dragon Beasts weren’t weak. Each and every one of them were Half Martial Emperors. The strongest among them was actually a rank three Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts seemed to dislike talking. When they saw Chu Feng and Tantai Xue walk past them, they merely took a cold glance at them. They were neither friendly nor hostile. It was as if they were using their gazes to say ‘regardless of where you all are from, it’s best to not provoke us, because we are not to be trifled with.’</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that these King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were quite interesting. The reason why he felt that they were interesting was not because of their temperament. Rather, it was the fact that even though they were monstrous beasts, they had transformed themselves into the appearance of humans. Furthermore, each and every one, regardless of whether they were male or female, had all taken very beautiful appearances. It was as if they wanted to become handsome men and beautiful women among humans.</p>
 <p>“It’s here,” Tantai Xue finally stopped her footsteps and pointed toward a stone platform.</p>
 <p>This stone platform was rectangular in shape and constructed on top of a piece of lawn. It was ten meters long, five meters wide and less than three meters tall.</p>
 <p>The material of the stone platform was a bit special. It was not formed with ordinary stones. Instead, it was formed with a kind of diamond, a kind of black diamond. This sort of diamond could be said to be the toughest kind of diamond.</p>
 <p>“I am very confused as to why there is a stone platform here. Exactly what is the implication of this stone platform?” Tantai Xue asked with confusion.</p>
 <p>“Someone has altered this stone platform,” Chu Feng managed to detect that right away.</p>
 <p>“Really?” Tantai Xue was a bit surprised. Even though she was skeptical that there was something going on with this stone platform, she was unable to determine any traces of this stone platform being altered. Yet, Chu Feng was able to notice that with a single glance. This was truly unexpected for her.</p>
 <p>“I can guarantee that this stone platform is incomplete. There should be a stele on top of the stone platform. Merely, someone has taken away that stele. Even though they have concealed their tracks perfectly, they are unable to escape my eyes,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, what would be written on that stele? Furthermore, who would it be that took away the stele?” Tantai Xue asked.</p>
 <p>“I think that it is very likely that the stele should have offered some hints on how to get to the Immortal Island. The person who took away the stele did so because he did not wish for the people that came later to see the stele. If my guess is correct, the person that took the stele away was the first person who arrived on this island. Furthermore, he is someone very proficient with world spirit techniques, a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Otherwise, it would be impossible for even you to not be able to tell that the stele had been taken,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Exactly who was it that would do such a thing that harms others without benefiting himself?” Tantai Xue’s long, shapely eyebrows narrowed. A trace of anger appeared in her ice-cold eyes.</p>
 <p>With how unsafe this sea was, people should be helping one another. However, someone had actually done something that was the complete opposite of that. This caused her to be extremely displeased.</p>
 <p>“That’s not necessarily the case. It’s very likely that he decided to harm others for his personal benefit,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You’re implying that the stele likely contained things that benefitted him? In that case, exactly what do you think was written on the stele?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Tantai Xue became curious.</p>
 <p>“As that stele is gone, I can only make wild guesses. I think that it might contain information to some sort of treasure nearby, or what the path ahead would be like, or some other sort of hint. In short, everything is possible, but there was definitely some sort of beneficial information.”</p>
 <p>“In any case, Lil Xue, we must be extra careful later on. We must be on guard toward everyone,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Even though there was not much of a change to Chu Feng on the surface, he had become extremely alert and on guard. The people who had come to participate in this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly and had been able to make it to this island, could all be said to be extraordinary. However, the heart for self interest was dreadful. At this time, other than a specific few people, Chu Feng did not trust anyone else.</p>
 <p>Even though these people appeared to be harmonious with one another on this island, if something beneficial were to appear in the following path, it was very likely that they would fight each other for their own benefits. As such, they had to be careful.</p>
 <p>“I understand. Oh, that’s right… there’s a matter that I wish to speak with you about,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Don’t call me Lil’ Xue. It’s a very weird feeling. Just call me Tantai Xue directly,” Tantai Xue said.</p>
 <p>“But I’m already accustomed to calling you Lil’ Xue,” Chu Feng made a reluctant expression.</p>
 <p>“Then do as you wish,” Tantai Xue said in a helpless manner.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, Lil’ Xue, that must be your companion Chu Feng right?” Right at this moment, a man’s voice sounded, and a group of people walked over. They were people from the Beitang Imperial Clan.</p>
 <p>As for the person leading them, regardless of whether it was his age or his strength, he was very similar to Nangong Ya. Although he was quite young, he was already a rank three Half Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>However, the attitude of this man, when compared to Nangong Ya’s good-natured and amiable attitude, was worlds apart. He currently had an extremely unrestrained ill-intended smile on his face. Furthermore, he was sizing up Chu Feng with a gaze filled with contempt.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, allow me to introduce myself. I am Beitang Zimo. I am the Fourth Prince of the Beitang Imperial Clan,” After sizing up Chu Feng, Beitang Zimo extended his hand toward Chu Feng. He was trying to display his might.</p>
 <p>That was because he had declared that he was the Beitang Imperial Clan’s Prince, not a young master. This meant that his father was the Beitang Imperial Clan’s clan chief. Furthermore, the hand he extended toward Chu Feng contained hidden strength.</p>
 <p>“My pleasure to meet you.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled lightly. He did not bother too much with him. He was able to detect that this man had not come with good intentions. Thus, there was no need for him to bother with such a person. That was because, even if he were to greet him with a smiling face, this sort of man would still come and create trouble for him when the time to do so arrived.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? You do not even have the courage to shake my hand? Are you still a man?” Sure enough, Beitang Zimo spoke again. This time around, his tone was filled with provocation.</p>
