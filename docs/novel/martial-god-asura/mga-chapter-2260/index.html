 <p><strong> Chapter 2260 - Number One Expert</strong></p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you all this; what you have done today is very vile. This is especially true because you all are Law Enforcement Elders. As such, this matter is even more vile.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, I will spare your dog lives for the time being. After Elder Su Jingrui leaves his closed-door training, I will properly punish you all then.”</p>
 <p>“All of you, scram. Scram back to the Law Enforcement Department and ponder your mistakes. Without my order, you all are not allowed to go anywhere else. Anyone who goes against my orders will be killed without exception,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Milord,” Li Rui’s master and the other Law Enforcement Elders left while trembling with fear.</p>
 <p>At that moment, both Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang had astonished expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>As people of the Sunset Cloud Valley, they all knew that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master possessed a deep relationship with Li Rui’s master.</p>
 <p>Originally, none of them had expected that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley master would truly severely punish Li Rui’s master for Chu Feng’s sake. They thought that he would only lightly discipline Li Rui’s master.</p>
 <p>However, they now discovered that they had been mistaken.</p>
 <p>Their Lord Valley Master had not only publicly beaten up Li Rui’s master, he even beat him up so ruthlessly. This truly surpassed their imagination.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. After Elder Su Jingrui comes out from his closed-door training, I will definitely punish them severely,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said to Chu Feng with a face filled with apology.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master is being too courteous,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, this is not be being overly courteous. Rather, I cannot allow you to be wronged. Thus, I must definitely return justice to you,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley master said as he patted his chest.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said, Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang became even more astonished.</p>
 <p>After all, with the status that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master held, there was simply no need for him to be this courteous toward a member of the younger generation like Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Afterward, when the Sunset Cloud Valley invited Chu Feng back into his palace and ordered his servant to prepare generous gifts to express his gratitude toward Chu Feng, Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang were even more astonished.</p>
 <p>However, after thinking about it, they seemed to have realized something. After all, Chu Feng was not an ordinary member of the younger generation; he was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>The two of them had personally seen Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket, as well as the other grand characters from first tier powers, offering Chu Feng invitations outside of Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>“Immortal-cloak World Spiritists are truly extraordinary,” At that moment, Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang gasped with admiration in their hearts.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I wish to invite you to become a guest elder of our Sunset Cloud Valley. Might you be willing?” Suddenly, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.</p>
 <p>Once the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said those words, the person that was feeling the most joyous was none other than Xu Yiyi. Even though she did not say anything, she started to shoot meaningful glances at Chu Feng nonstop. She was telling him to hurriedly accept it.</p>
 <p>As someone from the Sunset Cloud Valley, she knew that there was not a single guest elder in the Sunset Cloud Valley right now.</p>
 <p>It was not that they did not wish to invite people to become their guest elders. Rather, they did not have any suitable people to become their guest elders. The reason for that was because the title of ‘guest elder’ came with a very respectful and high-standing status in the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p>
 <p>Without sufficient strength, it would simply be impossible for the Sunset Cloud Valley to invite someone to be their guest elder.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Lord Valley Master, for your kind intentions. Merely, I, Chu Feng, truly do not plan to join any power,” Chu Feng said in an apologetic manner.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, not to mention Xu Yiyi, even Elder Ning Shuang was startled. They truly never expected that Chu Feng would refuse.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, our Sunset Cloud Valley’s guest elder is actually only a nominal title. It will not bind you,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said with a smile.</p>
 <p>His intentions were very clear. If Chu Feng wanted to proceed to a higher elevation, it would be completely fine. This nominal title would not affect Chu Feng from joining other powers in the future.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, just accept it. You should know that our Sunset Cloud Valley’s guest elder title is not only unfettered to our Sunset Cloud Valley, it is also a very noble status.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s say it this way: if you are to become our Sunset Cloud Valley’s guest elder, then… your status would surpass even ordinary management elders. Even Elder Ning Shuang’s status would be greatly inferior to yours.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, although our Sunset Cloud Valley is a second tier power, both our Lord Valley Master and my master are rank eight Martial Ancestor-level experts.”</p>
 <p>“Among the second tier powers, our Sunset Cloud Valley is most definitely among the finest of all. If we are to continue to develop like this, our Sunset Cloud Valley will definitely become a first tier power one day.”</p>
 <p>“Even if the Four World Spiritist Emperors wished to create trouble for you in the future, our Sunset Cloud Valley would also be able to back you up,” At that moment, Xu Yiyi spoke to Chu Feng through a voice transmission. This girl was truly anxious. She really wanted Chu Feng to become their Sunset Cloud Valley’s guest elder.</p>
 <p>However, even after what Xu Yiyi told him, Chu Feng still shook his head decisively. He said to the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master, “Lord Valley Master, I, Chu Feng, truly do not plan to join any power.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng truly did not plan to join any power. Else, he would not have refused Liu Chengkun back then.</p>
 <p>Now that Liu Chengkun was dead, Chu Feng inevitably felt guilt in his heart. Thus… he was even more determined to not join any powers.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng had already offended some people, and should be finding formidable powers to back him up, Chu Feng would still not agree to join any of them.</p>
 <p>Not only was this a decision that he had already made before coming to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, most importantly, if he were to agree to join other powers now, he would have truly let Liu Chengkun down.</p>
 <p>“That’s alright. If little friend Chu Feng wishes to join our Sunset Cloud Valley in the future, the doors to our Sunset Cloud Valley will always be wide open for you,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master did not try to force Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Merely, little friend Chu Feng, I have a request. Might little friend Chu Feng be willing to help me with it?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, Yiyi and Elder Su Jingrui are people who have saved my life.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, Elder Ning Shuang also helped me on Mount Cloud Crane. Although I am not a part of the Sunset Cloud Valley, I am already associated with the Sunset Cloud Valley.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, Lord Valley Master, there is no harm in making your request. As long as it is within my capabilities, I will definitely help out,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Since that is the case, I’ll say it bluntly then. Originally, our Sunset Cloud Valley was actually only a small sect. Even among the tier three powers, our Sunset Cloud Valley was only a minor character.”</p>
 <p>“In fact, for a period of time, we were on the verge of being exterminated.”</p>
 <p>“Do you know how our Sunset Cloud Valley managed to obtain our current standing?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, please tell me how,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master smiled lightly. He said, “Regarding this, we would have to start from fifty thousand years ago.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, the founder of our Sunset Cloud Valley was merely a child still.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, a peak expert appeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. That person declared himself to be someone from the Ancient Era’s War Clan. Wearing silver armor and holding a silver spear in hand, he began to challenge the many powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and defeated all of them.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, he could be considered to be the fully deserving number one expert in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said.</p>
