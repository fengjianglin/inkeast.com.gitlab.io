 <p><strong> Chapter 2361 - Battle Power Capable Of Surmounting Four Levels Of Cultivation</strong></p>
 <p>“Eh. This is truly strange. Why would so many trash from many big clans be here?” Zhao Hong revealed a suspicious gaze.</p>
 <p>The reason for Zhao Hong’s reaction was because the outfits of those people from the younger generation showed that they possessed extraordinary status. Not only were there disciples from powerful tier two powers, there were also disciples from the four tier one powers among them.</p>
 <p>As for those people of the younger generation that were not wearing distinctive clothing, their cultivations were also generally pretty good. Likely, they too were people with backgrounds.</p>
 <p>“T-this bunch w-with special b-backgrounds, e-even though they generally have bad m-moral quality, i-it remains t-that they possess a special a-advantage. T-that is, t-they possess g-good backgrounds, w-which provides them w-with more re-resources than others.”</p>
 <p>“F-for t-them to be here f-for no reason or cause, t-there must be s-some sort of shenanigans,” Wang Qiang said as he narrowed his eyes while staring at that group of people.</p>
 <p>The intention behind his words was very clear. He felt that it was not an ordinary younger generation’s gathering for that bunch to be gathered In that place. It was very possible that they had come to search for something.</p>
 <p>“As for exactly what sort of shenanigan they might be conducting, wouldn’t we know if we listened?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Although the overall strength of that group of people from the younger generation was quite strong, and a few among them were stronger than Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, it remained that Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.</p>
 <p>Not only were they unable to detect Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, Chu Feng and the others were able to observe their each and every action, and hear all of their conversations.</p>
 <p>“Zhao Yu, is that news reliable? If we are to enter and it turns out that there’s nothing there at all, I will take away your little life,” From among the crowd, a two-meter-tall grave and stern-looking man spoke coldly to a thin man in the group.</p>
 <p>This robust and stern-looking man was wearing the outfit of the Kong Heavenly Clan. Although that man had a youthful appearance, Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were able to tell with a single glance that he was over a hundred years old. Strictly speaking, he was no longer a person of the younger generation.</p>
 <p>That said, that man was only a bit over a hundred years old, and far from two hundred years old. Thus, it was no wonder that he would be hanging out with those other people of the younger generation. Likely, both him and those people he was with felt that he was still a member of the younger generation.</p>
 <p>One thing worthy of mentioning was that that man’s strength was not weak. Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were able to clearly sense that this man was a rank one Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Kong Cheng, how could I-I dare to deceive you? It is absolutely true. I would absolutely not dare to deceive you,” That man by the name of Zhao Yu revealed an expression of absolute humility and fear toward that rank one Martial Ancestor Kong Cheng.</p>
 <p>This could not be blamed on him. After all, this man by the name of Zhao Yu was the one with the weakest cultivation among the bunch; he was only a rank two Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the rank one Martial Ancestor Kong Cheng, practically anyone in the group would be able to beat him into submission.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Describe the appearances of those two women again so that we can find them.”</p>
 <p>“Remember, if you dare to deceive us, we will definitely not let you off so easily,” Kong Cheng said.</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare, I definitely wouldn’t dare,” That Zhao Yu said while trembling with fear. Then, he began to describe the appearances of the two women to the crowd.</p>
 <p>It must be said that while this fellow by the name of Zhao Yu did not possess a strong level of cultivation, he was very proficient in describing someone’s appearance.</p>
 <p>His descriptions were so vivid and realistic that even just by hearing them, the crowd felt as if they could could see the appearances of the two women.</p>
 <p>“B-brother,” At that moment, astonishment filled Wang Qiang’s eyes. Unable to help himself, he looked to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, his gaze was much more complicated than Wang Qiang’s. He turned around and said to Zhao Hong with a very serious tone, “Zhao Hong, if I were to ask you to take care of that fellow by the name of Kong Cheng, would you be able to deal with him?”</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I am absolutely certain that I will be able to subdue him,” Zhao Hong smiled confidently. Then, with a joking tone, she said, “Chu Feng, you couldn’t possibly have taken a fancy to those two women just by hearing their descriptions?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not care about Zhao Hong’s joke. Instead, he said, “If possible, watch my back. I have some questions that I wish to ask that Zhao Yu.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he suddenly revealed himself, and began to fly toward that group of people. In the end, he landed before that Zhao Yu.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?!” The sudden arrival of a person that landed among them caused that group of people to be startled.</p>
 <p>After all, their current location was within the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond’s surroundings. A place like that was a place that people would not appear at all year-long. And if someone dared to visit, they would definitely not be individuals to be trifled with.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng ignored the questioning of the crowd. He directly grabbed that man by the name of Zhao Yu and asked, “Where did you see those two women?”</p>
 <p>A young man of the Kong Heavenly Clan with the cultivation of rank six Half Martial Ancestor pointed at Chu Feng’s nose and shouted, “Hey! Damned bastard, exactly who are you?! I am asking you a question here!”</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, two more figures descended from the sky. Like bodyguards, they stood at Chu Feng’s side.</p>
 <p>Naturally, the two of them were Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>The crowd was still relatively fine with Wang Qiang’s appearance. Even if he possessed a cultivation that surpassed Chu Feng’s, it remained that he was only a rank six Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>However, Zhao Hong’s appearance was no small matter. After all, she was a rank one Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“All of you, shut up!” Zhao Hong cast her cold gaze at the crowd. At the same time, her rank one Martial Ancestor’s oppressive might swept forth.</p>
 <p>“Huu~~~”</p>
 <p>Her powerful oppressive might was unstoppable. Other than that man by the name of Kong Cheng, the rest of the people present were all knocked flying by the oppressive might. When they landed on the ground, those with less severe cases were bleeding from their noses, whereas those with more serious cases had fainted away.</p>
 <p>Zhao Hong’s actions could be said to be extremely ruthless. She truly spared no-one. Even though she was only threatening the crowd, she still left them injured.</p>
 <p>“Martial Ancestor. S-s-she’s a Martial Ancestor?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, those people that were knocked flying all revealed frightened expressions. After all, they were all only Half Martial Ancestors. To them, the Martial Ancestor realm was an insurmountable summit.</p>
 <p>“You dare attack my people? Do you know who we are?” Kong Cheng asked coldly.</p>
 <p>“I don’t care who you are. I’m telling you to shut up so you’d best shut up. If you spout superfluous words again, I will tear your damned mouth apart,” Zhao Hong said.</p>
 <p>“Truly courting death! Did you really think that you, a mere rank one Martial Ancestor, would be able to contend against me?!” Kong Cheng revealed a furious look.</p>
 <p>“A mere Heavenly Bloodline possessor, why wouldn’t I dare to contend against you?” Zhao Hong said in a disapproving manner.</p>
 <p>“Mere Heavenly Bloodline possessor? What arrogance! I shall have you understand how powerful a Heavenly Bloodline is!!!” Kong Cheng was furious. As he spoke, he shot forth a punch directly at Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>His punch was no small matter. The power of the punch so strong that he was simply trying to take Zhao Hong’s life.</p>
 <p>While his cultivation was only that of a rank one Martial Ancestor, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Thus, to be exact, the strength of his punch was on par with an ordinary rank five Martial Ancestor’s attack.</p>
 <p>However, facing that punch, Zhao Hong only smiled lightly. She lightly swung her sleeves, and a strong wind immediately shot forth. Just like that, she easily blocked that punch.</p>
 <p>At that moment, not to mention the others, even that Kong Heavenly Clansman revealed a shocked expression.</p>
 <p>“You actually also possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?”</p>
 <p>“You’re also a possessor of Heavenly Bloodline?” Kong Cheng asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation was the symbol of Heavenly Bloodline possessors.</p>
 <p>Furthermore… only when one’s cultivation reached Martial Ancestor, and one’s Heavenly Bloodline’s Nine Divine Lightnings fused into one, would one’s battle power reach a level capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>Before reaching the Martial Ancestor realm, they generally only possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>At that moment, that Zhao Hong actually possessed the same heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Thus, the crowd felt that the only possible explanation would be that she was also a Heavenly Bloodline possessor.</p>
 <p>However, who would’ve expected that Zhao Hong would snort disdainfully when that Kong Cheng asked whether or not she was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor.</p>
 <p>With an expression of contempt, Zhao Hong said, “Humph, Heavenly Bloodline?”</p>
 <p>“Your mother, I, do not have it, nor do I care for it either.”</p>
