 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 675 - Gathering of Elites</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Look! It’s the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago! Waa, who’s that beauty? She’s so pretty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! She is simply comparable to the </span><i><span style>Four Seasons!</span></i><span style> I didn’t expect the Immortal Execution Archipelago to also have beauties like her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You idiots! Quiet down! That’s the daughter of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s master, Murong Xun’s younger sister, Murong Wan. Do you want to die by talking behind her back like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a commotion arose from the square. Focusing and looking over, one saw a group formed by several females appearing above the square, and judging by their clothing, one knew they were from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cultivation that group had was all very strong. Indeed, as it was known, the weakest was a rank four Martial Lord. Moreover, they were not very old, and the one who led was even a rank five Martial Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did the rank five Martial Lord have powerful strength, her appearance was outstanding too. It seemed that she wasn’t too old, and at most, she had recently passed the age of twenty. Looking at her youthful and pure countenance, one could even say she was a young lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, from the respectful and fearful looks that the Immortal Execution Archipelago geniuses behind her gave, Chu Feng knew, from guessing, that she was Murong Xun’s younger sister, Murong Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-i-isn’t that Ya Fei? The fiancée of the young master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, one of the Eastern Sea Region’s three great beauties, Ya Fei?” Very soon, another group of people formed by beauties appeared, and a few, to Chu Feng, were familiar faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman who led was incomparably beautiful. She was seductive and hot, and when one looked at her bulging two peaks, slender long legs, lustre and snow-white skin, their blood vessels burst and they couldn’t even look away. The only person on scene that could be comparable to her was Qiu Zhu, and that woman was naturally Ya Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for those behind her, all of them were her attendants. However, those who came here today were all rank four Martial Lords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s said that Ya Fei and Qiu Zhu have the same level of fame, and looking at them today, they are indeed outstanding. Truly rarely seen great beauty.” When he saw Ya Fei, Gao Xiong and the other males were quite moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard that Lady Qiu Zhu’s beauty is like ice, whereas Ya Fei’s beauty is like fire. It seems like the rumours are true! This Ya Fei is truly like a flame—with a glance, it makes one’s blood boil and one would even want to get intimate with her. Hehe.” The disciple from the Four Seas Academy called Wang Long even shamelessly licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph. She dresses up like a woman from a brothel. How can she be compared to my Senior Qiu Zhu?” Chun Wu coldly snorted, then shot a glance at Wang Long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ehh, hehe, Lady Chun Wu is right, Lady Chun Wu is right. That Ya Fei looks decent at a glimpse, but she is truly inferior to Lady Qiu Zhu when looked at in more detail. Lady Chun Wu is more beautiful than her too!” Wang Long had a face full of solicitousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph.” However, facing people like Wang Long, Chun Wu once again coldly snorted, the disdain in her gaze not diminishing, but instead, increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nevertheless, regardless of what Chun Wu thought, it had to be admitted that the commotion made by Ya Fei’s appearance indeed overshadowed Murong Wan’s. The title of the number one beauty was indeed powerful, especially Ya Fei’s allure that made one’s mood explode. Her level of attraction was even higher than Qiu Zhu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instantly, many people started to compare Ya Fei’s and Qiu Zhu’s appearance, but no matter the result, the males on scene had feasted their eyes fully by the concurrent appearance of the two great beauties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That Murong Wan doesn’t seem to like her future sister-in-law that much, huh.” As the crowd was focused on Ya Fei and Qiu Zhu, Chu Feng cast his gaze towards Murong Wan. He could see that the young lady had an unsightly face at that moment. When she looked at Ya Fei, there seemed to be a bit of enmity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard that there’s been some clashes between Murong Wan and Ya Fei, and looking at their attitudes today, it seems like that rumour is true,” Xia Yu said with a smile, as if she really liked the conflict between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look! More people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago have come! They are truly interesting… Obviously, they’ve come together, yet they don’t come together.” Just at that moment, another group of people walked over from the bottom of the mountain peak. Like before, they were from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were also several people in that group, but there was both men and women. The one who led, like before, was also a rank five Martial Lord, but it wasn’t a beauty. It was a young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person is called Zhan Feng. He’s the son of the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s Second Immortal, Zhan Jiuxiao and is one of the top geniuses of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Although he may look young, he does things ruthlessly, doesn’t care what method he uses, and doesn’t care about the consequences. In comparison to Murong Wan and Ya Fei, that person requires extra caution,” said Xia Yu to Chu Feng and the others via mental messaging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhan Feng, huh? He really does look like a ruthless person.” After hearing Xia Yu’s words, Chu Feng examined him in detail and discovered that innately, that person had a sinister appearance. The type that could make a child cry just by looking at his outer appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Feng knew that Zhan Feng’s sinisterness did not only come from his appearance. From the faintly detectable aura on his body, Chu Feng could feel that his hands had been tainted by quite a bit of blood. The number of people who died by his hands numbered at least several tens of thousands. Indeed, he was a great demon who killed without even blinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago appeared in succession. Some came alone, some came in pairs, side-by-side, some formed groups of three or five, but other than Murong Wan, Ya Fei, and Zhan Feng, there was nothing special to notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all of the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago arrived, pretty much everyone who had the qualifications to enter the Martial Marking Immortal Realm was present. Chu Feng initially wanted to peacefully await the opening of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, but he could do nothing about that as a very unkind gaze locked onto him. It was Ya Fei. Not only did she discover Chu Feng, she even told her group of subordinates to stay behind, and aggressively walked towards Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look! Ya Fei is coming over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Waa, this great beauty is actually walking towards me on her own accord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Ya Fei walk towards them, everyone who stood together with Chu Feng were very confused. They couldn’t think of a reason why Ya Fei came to them because clearly, no one knew Ya Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, they made a guess that Ya Fei very likely came for Qiu Zhu to greet her. After all, as the “great beauties” of the Eastern Sea Region, the two of them, regardless of cultivation or appearance, were very similar. They were always figures of comparison, and unknowingly, the two of them became rivals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the crowd did not expect that after Ya Fei neared, she simply paid no attention to Qiu Zhu and directly walked up to Chu Feng, saying with a light smile, “What a coincidence! I didn’t think I would meet you here too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is really quite a coincidence.” Chu Feng smiled faintly, though there weren’t many changes on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you’ve also gotten the qualifications to enter the Martial Marking Immortal Realm? You’ve passed through the screening to do that, right?” Ya Fei asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I’m sorry, you’ve guessed wrong. I’ve gotten the qualifications because I received a Misty Badge.” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out his own Misty Badge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing the badge in Chu Feng’s hand, Ya Fei was taken aback. However, she was not that shocked and only said, “I’ve heard that it’s quite dangerous in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. After entering, you must be a bit more careful.” After leaving those words behind, she turned around and left. From the very start, she had never even looked at anybody else.</span></p>
