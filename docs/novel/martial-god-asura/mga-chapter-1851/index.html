 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1851 - Making Inquiries About The Blind Old Man</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s really you,” Right at this moment, Sima Ying and the others ran over. Sima Ying even directly leaped in front of Chu Feng and grabbed the corner of his sleeve. She was grinning from ear to ear. It could be seen that she was extremely excited.</p>
 <p>“Lil Sis Ying, it’s been a while,” Chu Feng stroked Sima Ying’s blazing red hair intimately. He was also extremely happy to see Sima Ying, for she was truly a friend that he had spent life and death with. Their relationship was very deep.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, it’s been a while. However, seeing you again, I am truly shocked. What’s with you? How did you become this powerful? You’ve become so powerful that you’ve cast us far behind,” Sima Ying asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Brother Chu Feng, isn’t the speed of your cultivation’s increase too fast? How are we supposed to catch up to you?” Fu Feiteng and the others said.</p>
 <p>Faced with Sima Ying’s questioning as well as the passionate gazes of Fu Feiteng, Lin Yezhou and the others, Chu Feng could only smile foolishly. After all, how was he supposed to explain this sort of thing? Should he say that his talent was exceptional, and that was why his breakthrough speed was so lightning fast? That this was why he had managed to leave them far behind? Chu Feng would naturally not be able to say something like that.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, “Eh? Where’s Su Mei?” He had discovered that Su Mei was not among the crowd here.</p>
 <p>“Lil Mei was received by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal,” The Left Reverend said.</p>
 <p>“The Weaponry Refinement Immortal?” Although Chu Feng was surprised to hear that Su Mei was with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, he did not continue to ask.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was a very strong senior in Chu Feng’s heart. Furthermore, he was also his benefactor that had helped him before.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng knew that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, like the Left Reverend, also possessed a certain connection with the master of Su Mei and the others, that blind old man. Thus, Chu Feng was not at all worried that Su Mei was with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. As such, he did not ask further.</p>
 <p>“The Dark Hall is unfathomable. They have failed this time. However, they will definitely come to create trouble for the World Spiritist Alliance again. I’m afraid that the World Spiritist Alliance cannot remain here anymore,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, regarding that, you can rest assured. Our World Spiritist Alliance has not been in existence for so long without any preparations for the unexpected. As long as we activate our defensive formation, regardless of how many experts the Dark Hall might send, they will not be able to break through to our World Spiritist Alliance.”</p>
 <p>“We had allowed them to enter this time around because we were caught off guard. However, after today, our World Spiritist Alliance will activate that defensive formation. Unless we have important matters to take care of, our disciples and elders will all not leave here,” The World Spiritist Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Is that truly feasible?” Chu Feng was worried.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you can rest assured. What sort of place is our World Spiritist Alliance? It is a gathering of World Spiritists. Perhaps our current generation is inferior to the generation of our founder. However, the defense of our World Spiritist Alliance is most definitely among the very best in the Holy Land of Martialism.”</p>
 <p>“As long as we activate our grand defensive formation, absolutely no one will be able to break through it and reach our World Spiritist Alliance. Furthermore, our World Spiritist Alliance possesses all the required materials to do so. Even if our people are to live here for several thousand years, it would still not be an issue,” The Left Reverend said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized the intentions of the Left Reverend and the World Spiritist Immortal.</p>
 <p>The reason why the Dark Hall had been able to break in was actually very simple. As long as they abducted an elder or disciple, they would be able to enter the World Spiritist Alliance. Upon entering, that defensive formation would be ineffective.</p>
 <p>However, after what had happened, the World Spiritist Immortal planned to completely seal off the World Spiritist Alliance. Once that happened, there would be no gap for the Dark Hall to break through into the World Spiritist Alliance. If they wished to attack the World Spiritist Alliance, they could only do so head-on.</p>
 <p>However, it could be seen that the people from the World Spiritist Alliance were extremely confident in their defensive formation. Even if the Dark Hall were to come again, they would still not fear them.</p>
 <p>However, this would also lead to the elders and disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance only being able to stay in the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>To speak of it unpleasantly, they were so frightened by the Dark Hall that they would not even dare to open their doors again, and could only withdraw themselves into that defensive formation. However, to the current World Spiritist Alliance, that was the only method for them to protect themselves.</p>
 <p>Even if they became an object of ridicule for others by doing so, it would still be better than the massacre of everyone in the World Spiritist Alliance and the destruction of the World Spiritist Alliance itself.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, with your talent, you will be able to surpass the Four Great Imperial Clans sooner or later. You might even be able to become the strongest person in this era.”</p>
 <p>“However, it remains that you have yet to mature, and the Four Great Imperial Clans are determined to take your life.”</p>
 <p>“How about you stay here with us? It would not be too late to seek revenge after you’ve matured,” The World Spiritist Immortal suggested.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you do not know about this. However, for this junior to reach a breakthrough, I need an enormous amount of cultivation resources. If I am to stay here, I fear that I will not be able to progress.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, I possess many friends outside. If the Four Great Imperial Clans were to discover their connection with me and decided to go after them after being unable to catch me, I would feel extremely guilty,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“This… Okay then,” Seeing how determined Chu Feng was, the World Spiritist Immortal and the others no longer tried to urge him to stay.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, while it’s fine to leave, you must take this,” Suddenly, the Left Reverend took out a cloak and handed it to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>This cloak was no ordinary cloak. It was dazzling with a golden sheen, and made out of exquisite materials. This was a Royal World Spiritist Cloak. However, it was no ordinary Royal World Spiritist Cloak, for it was much more precious than ordinary Royal World Spiritist Cloaks.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because a large character was written on that Royal World Spiritist Cloak. This character was an Ancient Era’s character. The people of this era were incapable of understanding it, nor did they know what it represented. However, it greatly resembled the character ‘King,’</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this ‘King’ character was emitting a special sort of power. This power caused the cloak to appear extraordinary. With a single glance, one could tell that it was an extraordinary item.</p>
 <p>“King Royal Cloak,” Chu Feng’s eyes shone upon seeing that Royal Cloak. This King Royal Cloak had been presented to him as a gift by the Left Reverend before. Merely, at that time, Chu Feng felt that he did not have the strength to protect the King Royal Cloak. As such, he did not accept it, and asked the Left Reverend to safekeep it for him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this Reverend has helped you safekeep this King Royal Cloak for some time now. It’s time for it to be returned to its rightful owner,” The Left Reverend said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this time around, you must definitely not refuse it again. Right now, you possess the power to safekeep this King Royal Cloak yourself,” Miao Renlong said with a beaming smile. He was intentionally mocking Chu Feng for refusing the Left Reverend’s gift back then.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, accept it. This junior brother of mine has treated that King Royal Cloak as a treasure. He refused even me when I asked to borrow it to wear. However, he was willing to present it to you. As such, he has truly placed his trust in you, and thinks highly of you,” The World Spiritist Immortal added.</p>
 <p>“Thank you seniors,” This time around, Chu Feng did not refuse, and accepted the King Royal Cloak.</p>
 <p>“Senior Left, I have another question that I wish to ask of you,” Chu Feng said those words through a voice transmission.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I have something that I wish to discuss with you alone,” The Left Reverend understood Chu Feng’s intentions. Thus, he said those words and soared into the sky. He proceeded to fly toward a place without people. As for Chu Feng, he naturally followed after the Left Reverend.</p>
 <p>None of the people present were fools. They were actually able to guess a bit about what was going on. Thus, no one followed them, and no one tried to disturb Chu Feng and the Left Reverend.</p>
 <p>“Senior Left, exactly who is that senior that entrusted Lil Mei to your care? Might you be capable of telling me?” Chu Feng wanted to make some inquiries about the blind old man from the Left Reverend.</p>
 <p>After all, Su Mei had once said to Chu Feng that the Left Reverend was an old friend of that blind old man. Thus, Chu Feng felt that the Left Reverend might know things regarding that blind old man.</p>
