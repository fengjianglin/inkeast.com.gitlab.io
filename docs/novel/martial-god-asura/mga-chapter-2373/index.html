 <p><strong> Chapter 2373 - Unfair</strong></p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, this subordinate will follow little friend Kong Zheng into the Hundred Refinements Stage. I will absolutely not let him do anything that goes against our Hundred Refinements Stage’s rules. Lord Clan Chief, please rest assured,” Hu Xuanyi continued to plead for Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>“The rules are dead, whereas people are alive. Since this matter concerns the safety of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s younger generation, I will make an exception today, and allow little friend Kong Zheng to enter our Hundred Refinements Stage.”</p>
 <p>“However, little friend Kong Zheng, it will be up to you yourself as to whether or not you will be able to obtain that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said to Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Senior Clan Chief, please rest assured. This junior will definitely not disappoint you,” Seeing that the guardian clan’s clan chief had consented to allowing him to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage and obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, Kong Zheng revealed an extremely confident expression.</p>
 <p>Then, led by that Hu Xuanyi, Kong Zheng left the palace and proceeded toward the entrance to the Hundred Refinements Stage.</p>
 <p>After Kong Zheng left, an elder of the guardian clan turned to ask their clan chief, “Lord Clan Chief, how are you so certain that Kong Zheng will not be able to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?”</p>
 <p>Once that question was asked, the other elders also turned their curious gazes to their clan chief.</p>
 <p>The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was truly an extraordinary item. As such, the people from the guardian clan were curious about it too.</p>
 <p>“The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone has been placed there for many years. Regardless of whether it is people from our guardian clan or the cultivators from the Lower Realms, many people have wanted to obtain that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. However… has any one of them succeeded?” The guardian clan’s clan chief answered with a question.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, no one has managed to succeed,” The elders nodded to express their approval.</p>
 <p>One elder said, “Those who are curious about the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone are generally people of the younger generation. They possess one similarity. That is, they are all lacking in strength.”</p>
 <p>“This subordinate understands now. Although that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone has already lost its sealing power, it remains the Ancient Era’s Sealing Stone, and not an ordinary item.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, unless one’s cultivation has reached a certain level, it is impossible for one to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.”</p>
 <p>“No, that’s not it,” That clan chief shook his head. Then, he said, “Not to mention you all, even I… am unable to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.”</p>
 <p>“Clan Chief, then… exactly why is that the case?” Hearing what their clan chief said, the various elders were all shocked. Then, they felt very curious.</p>
 <p>As members of the guardian clan, they knew very well how powerful their clan chief was.</p>
 <p>Their Lord Clan Chief was actually a True Immortal-level expert.</p>
 <p>Merely, as he guarded the hundred refinements stage all year round, and behaved in a very low-key manner, the people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm did not know of his cultivation.</p>
 <p>That said, even though others did not know how strong their clan chief was, the people present knew very well how powerful he was.</p>
 <p>Thus, if even their Lord Clan Chief was unable to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, it would mean that it was unrelated to one’s cultivation, and was because of something else.</p>
 <p>“The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is something that only those from the Chu Heavenly Clan can move,” The guardian clan’s clan chief said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Heavenly Clan?!” Hearing those words, the crowd’s expression changed. They finally realized the truth.</p>
 <p>“Judging from that, it seems that there is truly no one capable of moving the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone,” At that moment, the various elders began to sigh.</p>
 <p>While the Hundred Refinements Stage was constructed by the Chu Heavenly Clan, and there were many people of the younger generation from the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, those Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all extremely arrogant and haughty people.</p>
 <p>They all felt that the Hundred Refinements Stage was merely a place to cultivate trash. As such, not to mention entering the Hundred Refinements Stage, they were disinclined to even go to that place.</p>
 <p>As for the guardian clan, the reason why they had guarded that area for generations on end was because they were once helped by an expert from the Chu Heavenly Clan. That was how they ended up shouldering such a heavy responsibility.</p>
 <p>Due to the help from the Chu Heavenly Clan back then, the people from the guardian clan possessed special sentiments toward the Chu Heavenly Clan. Unfortunately, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan looked down on them.</p>
 <p>They considered them lackeys; servants.</p>
 <p>In fact, they felt it beneath themselves to even meet them.</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>The entrance to the Hundred Refinements Stage was opened. It was not only Hu Xuanyi that followed Kong Zheng into the Hundred Refinements Stage.</p>
 <p>There were over twenty individuals who entered together with Kong Zheng. They were all very powerful, all peak Half Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>However, one thing worthy of mentioning was that there was not a single Martial Ancestor-level expert among them.</p>
 <p>As for the reason why there were no Martial Ancestor-level experts among them, it was not because the guardian clan did not possess Martial Ancestor-level experts, nor was it because those Martial Ancestor-level experts were unwilling to accompany Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>Rather, it was because the Hundred Refinements Stage possessed a special power and restriction...</p>
 <p>Unless one increased their cultivation from Half Martial Ancestor to Martial Ancestor in the Hundred Refinements Stage, it would be impossible for Martial Ancestor-level experts to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage.</p>
 <p>“Senior Xuanyi, that Chu Feng… he couldn’t possibly be able to enter this place too, right?” After the Hundred Refinements Stage’s entrance gate was closed, Kong Zheng turned to ask Hu Xuanyi.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Kong Zheng, please rest assured. I have already explained this matter to the others. Regardless of how much that Chu Feng pleads, he will not be allowed to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage,” Hu Xuanyi said.</p>
 <p>“This junior is put at ease by senior Xuanyi’s manner of conduct. Since you said it like that, that Chu Feng will definitely not be able to enter this place,” Hearing what Hu Xuanyi said, Kong Zheng smiled complacently.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of how many abilities he might possess, he will absolutely not be able to enter here,” Hu Xuanyi said.</p>
 <p>Hearing what Hu Xuanyi said, the complacent expression on Kong Zheng’s face grew even stronger.</p>
 <p>Then, he actually disregarded the presence of others and burst into loud laughter. “Chu Feng, you are but a person without any backing in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. What makes you think you can contend against me? Right now, you’re going to suffer. Hahaha!!!”</p>
 <p>At this moment when Kong Zheng was feeling extremely complacent and thinking that victory was within his sight, Chu Feng was rapidly flying toward the direction of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone with Ma Yue and Tian Yi.</p>
 <p>On their way there, Chu Feng came to find out from the conversation between the two that they were from the same Lower Realm. Furthermore, the two of them were a couple who had grown up as childhood friends. Right now, the two of them were already married.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt extremely envious of them. At the same time, the impression Chu Feng had of them also grew much more favorable.</p>
 <p>After all, in the world of martial cultivators, a place where one’s benefits surpass everything else, a love as pure as theirs was very rarely seen.</p>
 <p>“I’ve been hearing you two talking about revenge the entire journey. What exactly happened?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Senior, my wife possesses outstanding talent. As such, her cultivation speed is extremely fast. After we arrived here, she soon became a well-known individual among the cultivators. She also managed to rapidly reach the third place on the Hundred Refinements Ranking List.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, she already possesses the strength to compete for the second place on the ranking list. Thus, after she made her preparations, my wife issued a challenge to Zhou Zongzhi, the second-ranked individual on the Hundred Refinements Ranking List.”</p>
 <p>“However, that Zhou Zongzhi was so very despicable. He actually poisoned my wife and caused her to be unable to unleash her actual strength. Then, before everyone, he beat my wife to a seriously injured state,” Tian Yi said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“In that case, your wife’s injuries and poison were all caused by that Zhou Zongzhi?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That is the case,” Tian Yi said.</p>
 <p>“Since you two knew about the poison, why did you not report this matter to the guardian clan? Why did you instead hidee yourselves to secretly heal your injuries?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Tian Yi sighed. “That Zhou Zongzhi is from the Splendor Night Lower Realm.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Splendor Night Lower Realm, it is the strongest among the many Lower Realms. Practically every year, the strongest individuals in the Hundred Refinements Stage are from the Splendor Night Lower Realm. Thus, over time, the guardian clan began to favor the people from the Splendor Night Lower Realm, and would take very good care of them.”</p>
 <p>“The Elm Lower Realm that Lil Yue and I are from is simply incomparable to the Splendor Night Lower Realm. Before that, we had already suffered many unfair treatments. In fact, on some occasions, not only did we not obtain any assistance, we would instead be punished.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, even if we were to report this matter, it would be useless,” When mentioning that matter, Tian Yi felt very helpless.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected that this place would be that unfair too,” Chu Feng shook his head. After hearing those things, Chu Feng felt very disappointed with the guardian clan.</p>
