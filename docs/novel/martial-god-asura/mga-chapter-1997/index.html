 <p><strong> Chapter 1997 - Chu Feng Entering Closed Door Training</strong></p>
 <p>After Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal left, the curtains dropped completely on the Moonlight Maze’s battle.</p>
 <p>Although the great majority of the people that had entered the Moonlight Maze had returned empty-handed, there were also many that had obtained treasures in the Moonlight Maze.</p>
 <p>The treasures from the Moonlight Maze were no ordinary items; they were all invaluable and priceless treasures. Some among them were even capable of starting wars.</p>
 <p>However, to the people, the matter that was the most inconceivable were not the treasures that had been obtained from the Moonlight Maze. Rather, it was the major events that had occurred in the Moonlight Maze.</p>
 <p>The first major event was the battle between the Dark Hall and the Ancient Era’s Elves. Even though those experts that fought against the Dark Hall all left after the battle, it remained that there was no wall in the world that didn’t leak air. As such, news of the battle would eventually be spread. Furthermore, once it started, it spread like a wildfire.</p>
 <p>When the crowd found out that the Dark Hall was a power capable of contending against the Ancient Era’s Elves, and that the map of the Moonlight Maze was spread by them with the intention of killing all those that entered in order to summon the Moon Demon, the crowd all began to feel enormous fear of the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>They all realized that the mysterious power that had suddenly emerged was an extremely dangerous power.</p>
 <p>The Dark Hall had declared themselves to be the power that would rule over the Holy Land of Martialism. And now, they actually did this sort of thing. As such, the crowd could not help but feel fear toward the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>As for the second major event, it was the resentment between Chu Feng and the Heavenly Law Palace. Even though the Heavenly Law Palace’s Elder Yue Ling and Elder Zhao Yu had indeed wronged Chu Feng in the Moonlight Maze, it remained that Chu Feng had killed Elder Kuang Kui without bothering to say a single word to him when he questioned Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s action was absolutely looking down on the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>Although there were people declaring that the Ancient Era’s Elves were allies with Chu Feng, to many humans, the Heavenly Law Palace was not an existence inferior to the Ancient Era’s Elves. Thus, they felt that a great catastrophe would befall Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because, with the nature of the Heavenly Law Palace, they would absolutely not leave the matter at that.</p>
 <p>At the moment when this news was rapidly spreading throughout the Holy Land of Martialism, Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had arrived at the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>After returning to the Cyanwood Mountain, Chu Feng entered closed-door training. He was going to use his world spirit techniques to study a grand spirit formation that not even peak Martial Emperors could break through.</p>
 <p>That grand spirit formation was extremely difficult. Furthermore, with Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques, it was even more difficult to successfully set up that spirit formation.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng still had to study it. The reason for that was because the Cyanwood Mountain was no longer the same as before. After what had happened in the Moonlight Maze, even Zhang Tianyi and his father had arrived at the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>It could be said that all the people related to Chu Feng were practically all gathered in the Cyanwood Mountain right now. As the battle against the Dark Hall had already begun, Chu Feng had to put forth all of his strength to protect the people important to him.</p>
 <p>During this time when Chu Feng was in closed-door training, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Baili Xuankong, Nangong Longjian, Zhang Tianyi and his father Zhang Ming, Bai Ruochen, Jiang Wushang and the others were all closely guarding the gate of Chu Feng’s closed-door training location.</p>
 <p>They were all worried for Chu Feng. The reason for that was because Chu Feng had looked like a completely different person ever since he had returned. They all knew that Chu Feng was acting like this because of Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>“Has little friend Chu Feng still not left his closed-door training?” An old man walked over to the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>Not only did this old man possess the same powerful cultivation as the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, his reputation was also on par with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. That old man was the Immeasurable Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Why is that boy Chu Feng so stubborn? It would be one thing to protect one person. But he wants to protect the entire Cyanwood Mountain. The Cyanwood Mountain is such an enormous place. Yet, he wants to set up a spirit formation capable of withstanding peak Martial Emperors? Isn’t that simply indulging in fantasy?”</p>
 <p>“If he continues on with this, he might go haywire and become possessed by a devil,” A snow-haired woman said.</p>
 <p>This person was also one of the Holy Land of Martialism’s Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. She was the person that had wanted to make Chu Feng her disciple, the Snow-haired Immortal.</p>
 <p>Both the Immeasurable Immortal and the Snow-haired Immortal possessed a decent relationship with the Ancient Era’s Elves. After finding out about the battle between the Ancient Era’s Elves and the Dark Hall, they had immediately proceeded to the Elf Kingdom to assist them.</p>
 <p>However, they were instead asked by the Elf King to come to the Cyanwood Mountain. Furthermore, they brought back news upon their arrival to the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>As the Dark Hall had suffered enormously in the Moonlight Maze, those Dark Hall’s forces that were attacking the various strategic locations held by the Ancient Era’s Elves had all retreated.</p>
 <p>However, the Ancient Era’s Elves did not relax just because of that. Instead, they were increasing the defenses at all these strategic locations so that they could face the Dark Hall’s next assault.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Ancient Era’s Elves were worried for the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, this time around, they had not only requested that the Immeasurable Immortal and the Snow-haired Immortal go to assist the Cyanwood Mountain, they had also dispatched a lot of their own forces to the Cyanwood Mountain as well.</p>
 <p>“Snow-hair, you can’t say it like that. Little friend Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques have surpassed our own. Likely, in the Holy Land of Martialism, only the Heaven Reaching Immortal possesses world spirit techniques comparable to little friend Chu Feng,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>After personally seeing Chu Feng grasping the spirit formation capable of sealing the Moon Demon in an instant, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was fully aware of how powerful Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng’s talent is truly exceptional. Furthermore world spirit techniques are the strongest defensive method in this world. In fact, there are even rumors that say that world spiritists are actually the strongest experts in the world.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, no one was capable of using only world spirit techniques. This is why the people in the Holy Land of Martialism ended up choosing, without the slightest hesitation, to master martial cultivation instead of world spirit techniques.”</p>
 <p>“However, little friend Chu Feng’s attainments in world spirit techniques are greatly superior to our own,” The Immeasurable Immortal also praised Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that evaluation a bit too high?” Hearing those words, the Snow-haired Immortal revealed a disbelieving expression.</p>
 <p>Even though she held great appreciation and admiration for Chu Feng, she did not feel that only the Heaven Reaching Immortal’s world spirit techniques would be comparable to Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because she knew very well that the World Devastator Immortal was capable of ranking second amongst the Ten Immortals not only because of his martial cultivation. Most importantly, his world spirit techniques were exceptionally powerful.</p>
 <p>However, based on what the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had said, Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques had already surpassed those of the World Devastator Immortal. She felt very skeptical of that.</p>
 <p>“Snow-hair, don’t forget that little friend Chu Feng is an Asura World Spiritist. Without mentioning anything else, merely the fact that he could make Asura World Spirits serve him is already something that no one can compare with,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed. Chu Feng’s strength back then cannot be compared to his current strength.”</p>
 <p>“Back then, Chu Feng was merely a rank one Half Martial Emperor. However, he released a rank one Martial Emperor-level Asura Evil Spirit in the Nangong Imperial Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Although that Asura Evil Spirit was only a rank one Martial Emperor, it nearly razed our Nangong Imperial Clan to the ground. Even though I managed to beat it back afterwards, I was also injured in the process.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, I felt that Asura Evil Spirit’s strength to not have been completely revealed. Else, even I would not have been a match for it.”</p>
 <p>“And that, that is the potential that little friend Chu Feng possesses,” Nangong Longjian said.</p>
 <p>“......” At that moment, the Snow-haired Immortal grew silent. The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s past accomplishments were truly astonishing and unbelievable.</p>
 <p>In fact, after hearing what Nangong Longjian said, it was not only the Snow-haired Immortal that was astonished. All the other grand characters present sucked in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>There were not many people that knew exactly what had happened in the Nangong Imperial Clan with the Asura Evil Spirit. This was also the first time that they had heard that story.</p>
 <p>Even though they already knew that Chu Feng was very powerful, what Chu Feng had revealed was only his heaven-defying battle power, as well as his powerful Inherited Bloodline. Thus, the crowd was focused mostly upon the martial aspect of Chu Feng’s cultivation. By comparison, they did not focus as much on Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>Yet now, the crowd finally realized that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were actually his most frightening aspect.</p>
