 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1568 - People One Should Not Talk About</strong></p>
 <p>“That’s good then,” Nangong Baihe did not bother to investigate the matter. However, even though she did not investigate it, she also did not try to have the old man and his disciples outside come in. Instead, she grabbed onto Nangong Moli’s hand and walked into the palace.</p>
 <p>Likely, she also knew that these two men were actually very hard to deal with. Even though they were acting very humble right now, it was not because they feared her. Rather, it was because they feared her clan.</p>
 <p>There was no reason for her to have unnecessary conflict with these two men because of the people outside. Speaking of it, this Nangong Baihe was a very realistic and bright person.</p>
 <p>“Young misses, your journey here must have been difficult. You must be hungry, right?” Seeing that Nangong Baihe did not plan to do anything to them, those two men immediately followed them back into the palace hall and politely handed the two lamb legs that they had finished roasting to Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng took a glance at the lamb legs and discovered that nothing had been done to them. Thus, he did not bother to do anything regarding the men’s action. Instead, he directly walked further into the palace hall. The reason for that was because there was an enormous map there. It was the map to the Immortal Island.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng discovered that this sea region was enormous. There were a total of ten isles like the one that they were on. As for the map, it indicated that each island led to another relatively larger one. However, that island was not the Immortal Island. That was because there was a very large island ahead of that island. Two words were written on top of that farther island: Immortal Island.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng came to an understanding of the map. This sea region was most likely separated into ten regions. They were currently on one such region. Furthermore, the endpoint of this region was the current isle that they were presently located on. Right now, what they would have to do would be to gather together on another island.</p>
 <p>If there wasn’t anything unexpected, a lot of people should have gathered on that island.</p>
 <p>That was because that island was the location where all the people from the ten regions must gather. As long as they reached that island, there would only be a single path left, the path directly toward the Immortal Island. However, merely by looking at the map, Chu Feng was able to tell that the last path would not be easy to travel. In fact, it might be the hardest path to travel.</p>
 <p>However, what Chu Feng cared about was not that. What he cared about was whether Zi Ling and Su Rou might have come here, and whether or not they were safe.</p>
 <p>He was also worried about which region Hong Qiang and Tantai Xue might be in, as well as their safety. After all, Chu Feng had realized how powerful this sea was. It was truly a very dangerous place.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, try out this meat, they’ve roasted it pretty well,” Right at this moment, Nangong Baihe walked over to Chu Feng with a lamb leg in hand. It was emitting a delicious smell. She had yet to eat it.</p>
 <p>“I’m not hungry, you all can eat,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Come on, give it a try. We’ve relied on you this entire journey, and you have been put to a lot of trouble. If you refuse to eat, I’ll find it very difficult to eat too,” Nangong Baihe said.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Big brother, eat first. If you don’t eat, Moli won’t eat either,” Nangong Moli held the other lamb leg and walked over with a pouting expression. These two sisters were actually determined to make Chu Feng eat.</p>
 <p>“Okay then. In that case, let’s eat together,” Chu Feng received the lamb leg from Nangong Baihe and took a bite off of it. Speaking of taste, this meat was indeed roasted pretty decently.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng had begun to eat, Nangong Moli and Nangong Baihe began to eat the other lamb leg with smiles on their faces.</p>
 <p>Actually, having reached their level, even if they did not eat or drink for months, they would not die from hunger. However, it remained that they were people. The journey had left them very weary. If they were to be able to eat delicious foods, it would also help comfort their mental state enormously. Thus, the three of them enjoyed the lamb legs.</p>
 <p>“Who is that boy? He actually managed to become associated with the Nangong Imperial Clan’s two young misses?”</p>
 <p>“No clue. Perhaps he’s only a pretty boy who managed to obtain enormous luck to receive the good graces from those two young misses.” The two brothers, Lei Buqun and Lei Buguang, began to mutter in low voices. When they spoke, a deep sense of jealousy could be heard in their words.</p>
 <p>Even though they were muttering with low voices, someone at Chu Feng’s level of cultivation would be able to clearly hear what they were talking about. Evidently, the two of them also knew that Chu Feng would be able to hear them. That was why they had deliberately muttered with low voices. Sure enough, these two fellows were not good-natured people.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, they’re speaking ill of you. Are you not planning to teach them a lesson?!” Nangong Baihe said. Even though she knew that she was no match for the two of them, she firmly believed that Chu Feng would definitely be able to defeat them. That was because she had experienced how powerful Chu Feng was during the journey. Ordinary rank three Half Martial Emperors would definitely be no match for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Forget about it. Why lower oneself to the level of people like them?” Chu Feng refused. He acted as if he did not hear anything.</p>
 <p>“So he’s actually a coward. Hahaha…” Seeing that Chu Feng did not react, those two men began to directly insult him and laugh loudly.</p>
 <p>“You two, pay attention to the way you speak. The troops of my Nangong Imperial Clan following behind us will soon arrive. If you do not behave properly, you’ll have to bear the consequences later,” Nangong Baihe was unable to sit tight anymore. However, she could not win against these two men in a fight. Thus, she could only bring up her Nangong Imperial Clan suppress them.</p>
 <p>After hearing the words of Nangong Baihe, the expressions of those two men changed. Sure enough, they did not dare to insult Chu Feng anymore. However, their mouths did not stop. Instead, they began to continue on, discussing other things.</p>
 <p>“Big bro, I wonder what happened to those two chicks who left this place several days ago. Do you think they’ll be able to reach the Immortal Island?” Lei Buguang asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“If it’s the two of them, I think they’ll be able to. After all, they’re so powerful. Even though they’re young, they are much more powerful than us brothers. They are not ordinary members of the younger generation. They are true geniuses.” When mentioning this matter, a faint lingering fear appeared in Lei Buqun’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. That chick wearing the blue long skirt was truly too powerful. The coldness she emitted was terrifyingly cold. It was simply enough to take one’s life. Even I was unable to endure that coldness. Even though she is a rank one Half Martial Emperor, I am definitely no match for her,” Lei Buguang also had an expression of lingering fear.</p>
 <p>“While that blue skirted chick was very powerful, I feel that purple skirted chick was even more powerful. Even though she did not reveal her strength, I keep thinking that she’s a very frightening existence,” Lei Buqun said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart immediately throbbed. It was evident that those two men were talking about Su Rou and Zi Ling.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng felt immense joy in his heart. It would seem that not only were Su Rou and Zi Ling here, they had also coincidentally been sent to the same region as he was. Based on what those two men said, Su Rou and Zi Ling should be very powerful right now. Furthermore, it seemed that Su Rou was now more skillful in using the Ice Pearl in her body. To Chu Feng, this was good news.</p>
 <p>However, soon, Chu Feng’s expression changed. That was because those two men began to speak about things that they shouldn’t have.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. That’s actually what I felt too. However, I also felt that that purple skirted chick was truly too beautiful. She was even more beautiful than the blue skirted chick. Her fair skinned face was simply perfect. If I could hug her and caresses her body, oh how nice that would be. If I could sleep with a chick like her, even if I were to die, I wouldn’t regret anything,” As that Lei Buguang spoke, he actually began to fondle the air as if imagining something. He had a very lewd and shameless smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Look at your shameless appearance. However, I actually thought of the same thing as you. Hahaha,” Lei Buqun also began to smile the same sort of lewd smile.</p>
 <p>“Two shameless scoundrels,” Hearing their conversation, Nangong Baihe started to frown. However, she did not say anything. After all, the two of them were discussing their own topics. Thus, she had no right to interfere.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly stood up and began to walk toward those two brothers.</p>
 <p>“You two, how do you wish to die?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“What did you say? You dare speak to us Qunguang Brothers like this? Have you grown tired of living?” After hearing what Chu Feng said, those two men were immediately enraged. Not only did they stand up, they even took out their respective Royal Armaments from their Cosmos Sacks. They had the appearance of wanting to teach Chu Feng a lesson.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzzzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng’s body started to flicker with lighting. Then, he suddenly attacked. ‘Woosh, woosh, woosh.’ Several crimson rays flew past, and then the Qunguang Brothers fell to the ground. They began to roll around while howling in pain. Blood soon began to spread and completely filled the ground below them.</p>
 <p>Not only had their cultivations been crippled, their tongues had also been sliced off. Even their family jewels had been sliced off. With their dantians destroyed and their consciousnesses shattered, they had extremely tragic appearances.</p>
 <p>“I shall have you two bleed to death,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he returned to Nangong Baihe, picked up the lamb leg on the ground, and began to continue eating it nonchalantly, as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“What happened with you? Earlier, when they insulted you, you completely ignored them. Why did you suddenly attack them now and even take their lives?” Nangong Baihe asked with both shock and fear. That was because Chu Feng’s actions were too ruthless. Furthermore, he acted so nonchalantly after doing those things. It was as if he did not think killing them was anything serious.</p>
 <p>“That’s because they were speaking about people whom they should not have,” Chu Feng said.</p>
