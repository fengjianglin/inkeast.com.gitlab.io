 <p><strong>Chapter 2749 - Demon-level Geniuses List</strong></p>
 <p>“You all know who they are?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, it seems that you really don’t know them?” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Who are they?” Chu Feng asked.<br>　<br>“Isn’t it written on the banner? Han Yu,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Who’s Han Yu?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“The hell?! Brother, don’t tell me you don’t know who Han Yu is,” At that moment, one of the two men behind Li Xiang looked to Chu Feng with an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>“Brother my ass. Since when did this guy become your brother?” At that moment, Li Xiang glared fiercely at that man. Then, he said to Chu Feng, “Where did you come from? I can tell that you’re not someone from our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Else, you would have known who Han Yu is.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, I am not from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. I have just arrived here, and indeed don’t know very much about the people and things here,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, then your daddy here will be benevolent today and explain who those three people are to you.”</p>
 <p>“That man with the long face is called Yuwen Tingyi. He is the young city master of Yuwen City.”</p>
 <p>“As for that man with the tanned face, he is called Yuwen Hualong. He is the number one genius in Yuwen City.”</p>
 <p>“Although Yuwen City cannot be considered an enormous power in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, both Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong are extremely famous geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”</p>
 <p>“As for their cultivations, I believe you already felt it earlier. The two of them are extremely powerful,” Li Xiang said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>He was smiling joyously when he said those words. There was a slightly provocative feeling to his smile. It was as if he was declaring to Chu Feng that he was akin to an ant before those two people.</p>
 <p>“I want to know who that Han Yu is,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That Han Yu is even more amazing.”</p>
 <p>“When mentioning Han Yu, one must mention the grand ceremony that happens once every three years in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.”</p>
 <p>“The Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition is a contest between the younger generations in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm under the age of a hundred years old. It is also the most anticipated grand ceremony in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition is a grand ceremony that practically all of the younger generations from the various powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would participate in.”</p>
 <p>“They will spar and compete with one another. As for those ranked amongst the top, they will very likely become grand characters in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”</p>
 <p>“Because of that, the top ten individuals in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition will be known as demon level geniuses. Commonly, the top ten rankings are known as the Demon-level Geniuses List.”</p>
 <p>“The ones capable of leaving their names on the Demon-level Geniuses List are known to be the ten strongest geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. They will receive the reverence and respect of countless younger generations. Even the various powers will have to treat them earnestly and without negligence.”</p>
 <p>“As for that Han Yu, he is the existence ranked tenth on the Demon-level Geniuses List,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“What sort of background does that Han Yu possess?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“In the path of martial cultivation, one’s talent is very important. One’s nurture is also very important. Naturally, a power capable of nurturing a genius like Han Yu would be very remarkable. The power behind Han Yu is the Swordking’s City.”</p>
 <p>“The Swordking’s City is a power not inferior to our own Sacred Pellet Villa. That’s why I said that Han Yu is an existence that you cannot afford to provoke.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, in terms of background, Han Yu would be the one with the most inferior background among all of the people on the Demon-level Geniuses List,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, can you tell me about who the other nine individuals on the Demon-level Geniuses List are, as well as where they’re from?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Originally, I disliked you greatly. After all, you meddled in my business. However, it just so happens that I’m a very kindhearted and good-natured individual. Thus, I might as well tell you about them,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” At that moment, Chu Feng sneered. Then, he said, “You’re kindhearted? How could a kindhearted person beat up a little girl?”</p>
 <p>“Brat, do you want me to tell you or not?” Li Xiang was slightly angry.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead,” Chu Feng said with an indifferent smile.</p>
 <p>“If you want to know, then listen carefully. If Han Yu is someone that you cannot afford to provoke, then the following nine people are people that you absolutely cannot afford to offend. Else, you wouldn’t even know how you died,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“You truly have a lot of superfluous words. Can you get to the main topic?” Chu Feng urged.</p>
 <p>“Brat, watch your attitude!”</p>
 <p>He sighed, “Forget about it. After all, your daddy is too merciful and kind. Listen carefully.”</p>
 <p>“Ranked ninth on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Chu Lingxi. She is one of the five most talented younger generations in the Chu Heavenly Clan right now. The five of them are known as the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Five Great Demon-level Geniuses.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Lingxi is currently the weakest among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s five demon-level geniuses.”</p>
 <p>“However, she is also the youngest among them, and the one with the best talent. Thus, it will be very difficult to determine what her growth will be like in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, not only does Chu Lingxi possess extraordinary talent, but her background is also extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>“Her grandfather is the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Law Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master, and her father is the Law Enforcement Hall’s Vice Hall Master. It could be said that her father and grandfather are in control of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Law Enforcement Hall.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Law Enforcement Hall, it is the existence in the Chu Heavenly Clan that holds the most power beneath the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Utmost Exalted Elders and Clan Chief. The Law Enforcement Hall is extremely strong, and holds enormous power.”</p>
 <p>“Because of this, whenever a person from the Law Enforcement Hall is to appear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, regardless of how powerful one might be, they will still fear them somewhat.”</p>
 <p>“The members of the Law Enforcement Hall are akin to envoys from hell. One would feel fear just hearing of them.”</p>
 <p>“Most importantly, not only are this Chu Lingxi’s father and grandfather existences that possess great strength and enormous power in the Chu Heavenly Clan, but her mother is also not an existence to be trifled with.”</p>
 <p>“In fact, her mother could be said to be even more amazing. The reason for that is because her mother is the princess of the overlord of the Ten Thousand Provinces Upper Realm, the Wanzhou Ancient Clan.” [1. Wanzhou means ten thousand provinces.]</p>
 <p>“If you are to offend Chu Lingxi, then you’re practically doomed to die. Even if the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm’s Chu Heavenly Clan is willing to spare you, the Ten Thousand Provinces Upper Realm’s Wanzhou Ancient Clan would not spare you,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“Continue,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng appeared to remain very calm, he had remembered Chu Lingxi’s name. According to what Li Xiang had said, this Chu Lingxi was indeed very extraordinary. The backing she possessed was truly powerful.</p>
 <p>“Ranked eighth on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Ghosteye Boy. He is the Ghost Sect Hall’s number one genius. As for the Ghost Sect Hall, they could be said to be one of the four strongest powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Ranked seventh on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Ren Xiaoyao. He is the Paradise Valley’s number one genius. Like the Ghost Sect Hall, the Paradise Valley is also one of the four strongest powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Ranked sixth on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Chu Huanyu. He is also from the Chu Heavenly Clan, and one of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Five Great Demon-level Geniuses.”</p>
 <p>“Ranked fifth on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Chu Haoyan. He too is from the Chu Heavenly Clan, and one of the Five Great Demon-level Geniuses.”</p>
 <p>“Ranked fourth on the Demon-level Geniuses List is Jian Wuqing. The power behind him is the Dao Imperial Palace. The Dao Imperial Palace is also one of the four strongest powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan,” Li Xiang said.</p>
