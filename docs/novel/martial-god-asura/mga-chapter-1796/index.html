 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1796 - Borrowing Another’s Blade To Kill</strong></p>
 <p>Chu Feng naturally could not hear what Baili Xinghe was thinking in his heart. However, Chu Feng was able to guess what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng looked to Leng Yue and said, “Oh, that’s right. Leng Yue, you’d best make sure that I do not discover people from the Heavenly Law Palace trying to assassinate me. Else, I will publicize all that has happened here today. I believe you know the consequences that that will bring.”</p>
 <p>“That being said, while I am able to temporarily keep what has happened here confidential, I am not sure about others,” As Chu Feng said those words, he deliberately took a glance at Baili Xinghe.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you!!!” Hearing those words, Baili Xinghe, who was already sweating like a pig, nearly fainted from anger.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was sowing dissension. He was most definitely sowing dissension. He was trying to borrow another’s blade to kill. Chu Feng was trying to have Leng Yue kill him.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Leng Yue also managed to react. She turned her gaze filled with coldness toward Baili Xinghe.</p>
 <p>In panic, Baili Xinghe immediately said, “Leng Yue, I, Baili Xinghe, swear upon the heavens that I will definitely not spread what has happened here today!”</p>
 <p>“How am I supposed to trust you?” Leng Yue began to walk toward Baili Xinghe one step at a time.</p>
 <p>“Leng Yue, you must trust me. No matter what, I, Baili Xinghe, am the personal disciple of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. I am someone who will definitely keep my word. I am definitely trustworthy.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Baili Xinghe discovered that Leng Yue began to have intentions of eliminating him. Thus, he tried his hardest to struggle free from Leng Yue’s binding. Unfortunately, Leng Yue’s power that had restricted him was simply too strong. He was simply unable to escape at all.</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, he had no other choice but to bring up the name of his master.</p>
 <p>Baili Xinghe was truly afraid, extremely afraid. He, Baili Xinghe, was the personal disciple of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. He possessed both talent and status. In the future, he would definitely have a bright road ahead. As such, how could he possibly be willing to die? How could he possibly be willing to lose all that he possessed?</p>
 <p>“Very well, I’ll reluctantly trust you,” Leng Yue had already arrived before Baili Xinghe. The murderous intent in her gaze had also decreased greatly.</p>
 <p>“My thanks,” Seeing that Leng Yue’s killing intent was gone, Baili Xinghe heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“Puchi~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, Baili Xinghe’s expression became distorted. He lowered his head and discovered that Leng Yue’s hand had pierced into his dantian. Blood was flowing from below his abdomen.</p>
 <p>Even though Leng Yue was already seriously injured by Chu Feng, it required no effort from her to take care of someone like Baili Xinghe.</p>
 <p>“Leng Yue, you!!!” Baili Xinghe had an expression of irreconciliation.</p>
 <p>“Baili Xinghe, although I trust you, I must kill you. As for the reason why, we both know.”</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, a trace of ruthlessness flashed through Leng Yue’s eyes. Her palm suddenly trembled. Then, Baili Xinghe was shattered into pieces.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this is yours. I hope that you can keep your promise. I won’t do anything to you. So, do not say anything about me,” Leng Yue tossed Baili Xinghe’s Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That Cosmos Sack was a scalding sweet potato. No matter what, Baili Xinghe was the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s disciple. However, Chu Feng still accepted that Cosmos Sack. The reason for that was because Baili Xinghe’s treasures were quite alluring.</p>
 <p>[1. The Cosmos Sack was a sweet potato because it contained treasures. It was scalding because contained within the Cosmos Sack were Baili Xinghe’s treasures. If Chu Feng were to reveal them, people would know, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal would know → Consequences for Chu Feng.]</p>
 <p>Although Leng Yue had handed Baili Xinghe’s Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng, Chu Feng did not feel grateful to her at all. Instead, he took off the ring on his finger and said, “Leng Yue, I have also recorded the scene of you killing Baili Xinghe.”</p>
 <p>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng carefully put the ring away.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are ruthless,” At this moment, Leng Yue came to a sudden realization that she had been made a fool of by Chu Feng again.</p>
 <p>“Heh, there’s no other way. For someone like you, I must resort to this sort of method.”</p>
 <p>“Remember, do not mention anything to your Heavenly Law Palace’s elders. Else, not only will I ruin your reputation, I will also make it so that you cannot stay in the Heavenly Law Palace. I will also make the Weaponry Refinement Immortal chase after you to kill you.”</p>
 <p>“You should know what sort of consequence you will suffer should you lose the protection of the Heavenly Law Palace and gain the Weaponry Refinement Immortal as your enemy.” When Chu Feng said those words, he was smiling. His appearance was extremely relaxed.</p>
 <p>However, when those words entered Leng Yue’s ears, they were like a myriad of blades piercing into her body. Furthermore, those blades were all coated with poison that caused deep penetrating pain to her heart and soul.</p>
 <p>Leng Yue did not say anything anymore. She retrieved the three bowls that sealed this region and prepared to leave.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough, I believe those are not yours, no?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Leng Yue turned around and discovered that Chu Feng was currently using an avaricious gaze to look at the three golden bowls in her hand.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Leng Yue’s body trembled. That Chu Feng was truly planning to suck her dry.</p>
 <p>However, there was nothing she could do. She was completely under Chu Feng’s control. As such, she could only toss the three golden bowls to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After tossing the golden bowls to Chu Feng, with serious injuries, Leng Yue soared into the air and left this place. She did not wish to stay here for a moment longer. She did not wish to see Chu Feng’s complacent expression again.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because seeing his complacent expression would make her remember her defeat.</p>
 <p>“These bowls are quite good. They’re rare treasures too,” Chu Feng put the bowls away. Then, he opened his world spirit gate and said to Eggy, “I have troubled you, Milady Queen.”</p>
 <p>“This is a trivial matter not worth mentioning,” Eggy waved her hand. Then, she entered the world spirit gate and returned to Chu Feng’s world spirit space.</p>
 <p>After returning to Chu Feng’s world spirit space, Eggy asked, “Chu Feng, did that ring of yours really manage to record everything? It’s that miraculous?”</p>
 <p>“How could it be that powerful? Although I obtained this spirit formation from the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram, it is not that miraculous. It only recorded the portion that I showed her earlier. It is unable to record anymore. Furthermore, that portion it recorded will also disappear very soon. It is impossible for me to save it long term.”</p>
 <p>“The hardest thing to change in the world are the things that have occurred. The time that has already passed, how could it possibly be saved?” Chu Feng looked toward the horizon and sighed.</p>
 <p>The strength of humans was, after all, limited. For a lot of things, it would be impossible to change.</p>
 <p>“That means, the scene of you defeating Leng Yue, and the scene of Leng Yue breaking her promise, neither of those are recorded?” Eggy was even more shocked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Then, what about when Leng Yue killed Baili Xinghe?” Eggy asked.</p>
 <p>“Also not recorded,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Even that small portion you’ve recorded will soon disappear?” Eggy asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. It will disappear by the end of today,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“My god! In that case, doesn’t it mean that you simply do not have anything that can be used to threaten Leng Yue?” Eggy began to worry.</p>
 <p>“Indeed. However, Leng Yue thinks that I do. Thus, I naturally do,” Chu Feng smiled. He had a confident expression on his face.</p>
 <p>The way he saw it, Leng Yue considered her honor to be more important than anything else. Even though she was skeptical of Chu Feng, she was not willing to take the risk.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had already contained Leng Yue completely. Likely, from today onward, Leng Yue would not dare to make Chu Feng her enemy again.</p>
 <p>“My my my, little fellow, you’ve made this Queen gain a whole new level of respect for you.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng was able to remain this calm and confident when even she started to get a bit panicky, Eggy suddenly realized that Chu Feng had truly matured.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a ray of light suddenly flew past. In the end, it landed beside Chu Feng. It was a person.</p>
 <p>“Leng Yue?” Seeing that it was Leng Yue, Chu Feng was surprised.</p>
 <p>Not only had Leng Yue arrived beside Chu Feng with a speed akin to light, her body had also been restricted.</p>
 <p>The next moment, a voice filled with anger sounded. “The two of you have fought in private, and even tried to act as if nothing had happened?”</p>
