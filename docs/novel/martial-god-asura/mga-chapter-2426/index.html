 <p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter 2426 - The First Manifestation Of Might</strong></p>
 <p>“There’s actually such a powerful Demon Armament in this world? This is simply many times more powerful than even Ancestral Armaments. Chu Feng is actually able to use such a powerful Demon Armament?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng… exactly what is his origin?”</p>
 <p>As the crowd praised in admiration, they began to ponder Chu Feng’s origin again.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Compared to the overwhelming might emitted by the Evil God Sword, Her Lady Queen was more concerned about Chu Feng’s safety.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had officially unleashed the power of the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>“For the time being, this sword has yet to go out of control. It has given its power to me, allowing me to use it.”</p>
 <p>“I now have a rough sensation of its power. If my guess is correct, I will be able to contend against True Immortals as long as I have it,” Chu Feng grew excited.</p>
 <p>“Really? Then quickly activate your Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings to increase your cultivation so that you can kill those Kong Heavenly Clan’s old farts,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>“No. right now, I have only obtained the strength of the Evil God Sword, and my cultivation isn’t really at the True Immortal realm.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, not only am I unable to use the Heavenly Bloodline’s power, I am also unable to use my martial power to unleash my martial skills and secret skills.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Chu Feng looked at the Evil God Sword he held in his hands, he said, “Right now, this sword is the only thing that I can use.”</p>
 <p>“The Evil God Sword is the only thing you can use?” Her Lady Queen revealed an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>“However, I feel... that this sword by itself is sufficient.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Chu Feng pointed the Evil God Sword in his hand toward one of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a strange and ear-piercing voice sounded. Then, a crimson sword ray was shot directly toward that Supreme Elder.</p>
 <p>“This aura, damn it!”</p>
 <p>Faced with the sword ray unleashed by the Evil God Sword, that Supreme Elder revealed a panic-stricken expression. He simply did not even dare to block the attack. Rather, he immediately moved aside to dodge it.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not give up just like that. He continued to brandish his Evil God Sword, and unleashed several sword rays toward that Supreme Elder.</p>
 <p>“Damn!”</p>
 <p>In Such a situation, that Supreme Elder could only try to dodge continuously.</p>
 <p>It was not that he did not want to fight back. Rather, Chu Feng’s attacks were simply too fast.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, it wasn’t that he didn’t want to block the attacks. Rather, the crimson sword rays emitted by the Evil God Sword were simply too frightening.</p>
 <p>Those sword rays brought that Supreme Elder a sensation, that... he was simply unable to block them.</p>
 <p>Thus, he naturally did not dare to block them.</p>
 <p>In merely a blink of an eye, that Supreme Elder was forced many thousands of meters away by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he did not continue to chase after that Supreme Elder. Rather, he arrived beside Kong Shunlian.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, that sword of yours!!!” Kong Shunlian was also astonished by Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>“Senior Kong, I will tell you about the origins of this sword in detail in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, we must get through this crisis first. As you’re already injured, you should not battle anymore. Leave with Wang Qiang first, I’ll handle them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Kong Shunlian revealed a surprised expression.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng completely disregarded Kong Shunlian’s expression.</p>
 <p>Instead, Chu Feng looked at the mysterious individual and said, “Senior, I do not know who you are. However, this Chu Feng is truly thankful that you have placed your life on the line to come to my assistance.”</p>
 <p>“Might you be willing to leave me your distinguished name? If this Chu Feng is able to live past today, I will definitely repay senior’s kindness today.”</p>
 <p>“Young Master Chu Feng, this old man is your servant,” That mysterious individual said.</p>
 <p>“Servant?” The response from that mysterious individual came like a sudden clap of thunder in the hearts of all the crowd present.</p>
 <p>“Servant? That unknown True Immortal actually declared himself to be Chu Feng’s servant?!”</p>
 <p>“Heavens, a True Immortal-level expert is actually Chu Feng’s servant?! Sure enough, Chu Feng possesses an extraordinary origin, a truly extraordinary origin!”</p>
 <p>The word ‘servant’ was caught by Zhuge Mingren. He immediately cried out in alarm.</p>
 <p>Once he muttered those words, the rest of the bystanders all heard it too.</p>
 <p>“True Immortal servant?! Chu Feng’s servant is a True Immortal?! Heavens! Chu Feng not only possesses such a powerful Demon Armament, what sort of huge monster does Chu Feng have behind his back too?!”</p>
 <p>“He is most definitely not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He must be a Young Master from a certain Upper Realm.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, Kong Heavenly Clan… oh Kong Heavenly Clan, you all have truly met your match now, no?”</p>
 <p>Upon finding out the matter of that True Immortal being Chu Feng’s servant, the crowd was completely astonished. However, they all burst into laughter too.</p>
 <p>They were all people standing on Chu Feng’s side. Thus, to them, this news was extremely great.</p>
 <p>At that moment, they were all certain that Chu Feng was not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Although there were indeed some hidden True Immortal-level experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they were all proud and arrogant individuals, and would definitely refuse to submit to others as servants.</p>
 <p>Thus, merely from one word from that mysterious True Immortal, the crowd was certain that Chu Feng must be someone from an Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>As for the Upper Realms’ huge monsters, how could a mere Kong Heavenly Clan possibly contend against them?</p>
 <p>At that moment, everyone felt that the Kong Heavenly Clan had kicked an iron plate, that they would definitely suffer enormously in the future.</p>
 <p>In fact, even the destruction of their Kong Heavenly Clan was possible.</p>
 <p>“Servant?”</p>
 <p>In fact, Chu Feng was also very astonished right now. No matter how hard he thought about it, he was unable to think of a True Immortal-level servant.</p>
 <p>“Senior, regardless of who you might be, I still thank you for your grace today. However, what happened here today is caused by me, Chu Feng. As such, I truly do not wish to implicate you. Thus… please leave too. You can leave the rest to me.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you…”</p>
 <p>Kong Shunlian’s expression grew increasingly shocked. He simply did not dare to believe his own ears.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was actually planning to take on three True Immortals by himself?</p>
 <p>“What shameless boasting. Do you really think that you can contend against True Immortals with a mere weapon?”</p>
 <p>“I will let you experience exactly how powerful the might of a True Immortal is right now.”</p>
 <p>The remaining Supreme Elder who was fighting against Kong Shunlian grew extremely furious and rushed to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>He brandished the Ancestral Armament he held in his hand and shot a slash toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That slash was no ordinary attack. Rather, it was a martial skill, an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.</p>
 <p>A True Immortal unleashing an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill with an Ancestral Armament, oh how powerful must that be?</p>
 <p>It was so frighteningly powerful that even Kong Shunlian, a fellow True Immortal, would not dare be careless toward it. Kong Shunlian raised his Ancestral Armament with the intention of blocking that attack.</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when Kong Shunlian was about to act, Chu Feng suddenly thrust forth his Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>A crimson sword ray was once again shot forth from Chu Feng’s Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>The very next moment, the crimson sword ray collided with the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill unleashed by the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder.</p>
 <p>To the crowd’s astonishment, the collision did not end in a loud explosion, nor did it create energy ripples wreaking havoc through the surroundings.</p>
 <p>Instead, like a stream assimilating into the sea, it quietly and completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>That’s right, it was like a stream assimilating into the sea.</p>
 <p>That Supreme Elder’s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was devoured, devoured by the Evil God Sword’s sword ray.</p>
 <p>At that moment, not only did that crimson sword ray not grow weaker, it instead became more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>That scene stunned everyone present.</p>
 <p>One should know… that the people involved, with the exception of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, were all True Immortals.</p>
 <p>When even True Immortals were stunned, one could tell how astonishing what had just happened was.</p>
