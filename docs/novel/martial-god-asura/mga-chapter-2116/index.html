 <p><strong> Chapter 2116 - The Disclosure Of The Truth</strong></p>
 <p>“Master, please sit,” That old man’s voice sounded again. However, he still had yet to reveal himself.</p>
 <p>“Senior, why don’t you show yourself?” Chu Feng clasped his fist.</p>
 <p>“Master, it has only been several years since we last met, yet you’ve actually forgotten my voice?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an old man appeared beside Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Senior, it’s you?” Upon seeing that person, Chu Feng revealed an overjoyed expression.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng recognized that old man. He was none other than the blind old man he had met in the Eastern Sea Region.</p>
 <p>“Master, please don’t address me as senior. To be precise, I am your servant,” As the blind old man said those words, he bowed to Chu Feng respectfully.</p>
 <p>Although the blind old man was truly blind, he seemed to possess an extremely strong perception. Through his perception, he was able to see the entire world.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what exactly is going on here?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Please stop addressing me as ‘senior’, for that would be equivalent to cursing this old servant to die sooner. If you do not mind, you can address me as ‘Blind Servant,’” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“Senior is a great benefactor to this Chu Feng. How could I address you as a servant? If you do not mind, I can address you as ‘Blind Uncle,’” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Actually, based on the difference in age between the two of them, Chu Feng should be addressing the blind old man as ‘grandpa.’ However, Chu Feng felt that the word ‘grandpa’ possessed too much seniority, and that the blind old man would refuse to accept being addressed as ‘grandpa.’ Thus, he decided to address him as ‘uncle.’</p>
 <p>“Since master insists, then please address this old servant as such,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“Blind Uncle, exactly what is going on here? Where is Zi Ling right now?” Chu Feng asked in succession.</p>
 <p>He knew that the blind old man had taken Zi Ling away a long time ago. Chu Feng had been worried about Zi Ling’s safety the entire time.</p>
 <p>“Master, please have a seat. I’ll slowly tell you everything,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Chu Feng did not hesitate, and took a seat. He was able to tell that this blind old man would not tell him anything should he not sit.</p>
 <p>It was different from before. Chu Feng seemed to really be their master. All the people in this Realm of Gods, regardless of what their cultivation might be, regardless of how much more powerful they were compared to Chu Feng, none of them dared to disrespect Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I shall start explaining from this place known as the Realm of Gods to the people of the Holy Land of Martialism. This place is the former site of the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“The Chu Heavenly Clan was the most powerful clan in the Holy Land of Martialism after the Ancient Era passed. In their era, no one dared to disobey them. They were the true rulers of this land.”</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Era’s Elves that deem themselves to be the rulers now were also extremely respectful toward master’s clan back then. Every year, they would always pay enormous tribute to the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“The so-called Five Emperors after the Ancient Era, if they were placed before master’s clan, they would all be nothing more than ants,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“My clan?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was surprised. He had actually already had the thought that he possessed a special relationship with the Realm of Gods, that the Realm of Gods had a very high chance of being a remnant of his clan. Merely, he did not dare to ascertain anything.</p>
 <p>The reason for all that was because the Old Ape that he met on the Heavenly Road had told him that his clan originated from this world. Merely, the Old Ape did not tell him whether remnants of his clan remained in this world. He only said… that the people of this world had already forgotten about his clan.</p>
 <p>“Blind Uncle, in that case, are there any of my clansmen left in this place?”</p>
 <p>“Why did they decide to enter the Outer World?”</p>
 <p>“Moreover, do you have any news of them now?” Chu Feng asked in succession.</p>
 <p>“Master, please don’t be anxious. This old servant will explain everything to you,” The blind old man said, “Currently, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan is in the Outer World. This old servant possess a low status. Thus, I do not have any news regarding them.”</p>
 <p>“As for why they decided to enter the Outer World, it was because a great lord appeared in the Chu Heavenly Clan back then. That person possessed extremely powerful strength that surpassed all of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s previous Clan Chiefs. He was confident that he would be able to let the Chu Heavenly Clan obtain an acknowledged place even in the Outer World.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, although the Chu Heavenly Clan was the fully deserving overlord of the Holy Land of Martialism, none of its clansmen were willing to stay in this place for the rest of their lives. Thus, they ended up deciding to proceed for the Outer World together.”</p>
 <p>“Back then, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan planned to leave. However, they were unwilling to abandon this place. Thus, that great lord ordered us, their servants, to stay here and guard this place.”</p>
 <p>“However, that great lord was still worried. He feared that there would be people in the Holy Land of Martialism that would pretend to be people from the Chu Heavenly Clan and ruin the Chu Heavenly Clan’s reputation.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, before leaving, he had eliminated the memory of the Chu Heavenly Clan from all the people in the Holy Land of Martialism. Thus, as matters stood, there was no one in the Holy Land of Martialism that knows that the Chu Heavenly Clan was the true ruler after the Ancient Era.”</p>
 <p>“All these years, us, the servants, have guarded this place the entire time. We have never set foot outside,” The blind old man explained.</p>
 <p>“In that case, the reason why the Realm of Gods possessed its ferocious name, the reason why so many people would die in the Realm of Gods was all caused by you all?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Throughout our generations, we have followed that great lord’s order. We are not allowed to let the people of this world know about our existence, or the existence of the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“However, we would also not willfully slaughter the innocent. Merely, for the sake of preventing others from knowing about us, we set up many traps in this place. Many of the people who died here were killed after they triggered the traps, and not because they were killed by us.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, we will also warn them before they encounter those traps. Merely, they refused to listen, and insisted on entering. As such, their deaths cannot be blamed on us,” The blind old man explained.</p>
 <p>“But, didn’t they say that all the people that set foot into this place will definitely end up dying?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That was all falsehoods,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“I’ve also heard that this place possessed a special sort of germ. If one were to be infected by it, one would definitely die. Furthermore, all the people that entered this place would be infected by it.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, it is said that those below the Martial Emperor level will definitely die if they are inflicted by that germ. Is that true?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That germ does exist. It is something emitted by a special plant in this place. However, not everyone will be infected by it. Only those that enter the area where that plant is grown will be infected,” The blind old man explained.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case. But, if you all just do not wish for people to know about this place, wouldn’t it be fine to seal this place away? Why go through that much trouble?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That great lord said that the gates to this place could not be closed. If we were to close the gates, it would signify that we are afraid. The Chu Heavenly Clan does not fear anyone,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“I understand now,” Chu Feng truly understood. His clan was most definitely extremely conceited. They were so conceited that while they did not wish for people to know about this place, they refused to conceal it.</p>
 <p>In the end, even though Chu Feng’s clan had left, even though they had wiped away the memories regarding them from everyone...</p>
 <p>The Chu Heavenly Clan actually did not wish for the people to truly forget about them.</p>
 <p>Thus, even though they had left, they still left behind fear, a fear of the unknown.</p>
 <p>Using that fear, they warned the people from the Holy Land of Martialism that regardless of how powerful they might become, there remained a power they could not contend against in this Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>“But, Blind Uncle… why would you be in the Eastern Sea Region back then? At that time… you?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“This old servant had already known about master’s identity at that time. Furthermore, I have been secretly protecting you ever since the day you were brought out of the Heavenly Road by Huangfu Haoyue. Merely, because Lord Xuanyuan had ordered it, this old servant did not dare to inform you of the truth,” The blind old man said.</p>
 <p>“Lord Xuanyuan? Who is this Lord Xuanyuan that you speak of?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“He is your father,” The blind old man answered.</p>
