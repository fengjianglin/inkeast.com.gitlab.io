 <p><strong> Chapter 2383 - Shocking Everyone</strong></p>
 <p>“Force your way through? You really dare to boast!”</p>
 <p>“What place do you consider this place to be?! Who do you take us all to be?!”</p>
 <p>“I do not care exactly what sort of origin you might possess. However, I can clearly tell you that this place is the Hundred Refinements Stage, and that we are the guardian clan!”</p>
 <p>“Today, you have trespassed into this place. Your action is a capital offense! We are fully entitled to execute you on the spot!” Hu Xuanyi shouted coldly at Chu Feng. As he spoke, he unleashed his rank nine Half Martial Ancestor-level aura.</p>
 <p>Once his aura was unleashed, the winds immediately started to scatter the clouds.</p>
 <p>It turned out that this elder Hu Xuanyi was not only a peak Half Martial Ancestor, he also possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>His strength could be said to be extremely powerful. One must know that those who possessed heaven-defying battle power were already extraordinary individuals in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As for a battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, it was even more so.</p>
 <p>“Kong Zheng wanted you to execute me on the spot, and you immediately decided to execute me on the spot. Seems to me like you don’t resemble a member of the guardian clan, and instead resemble a dog of the Kong Heavenly Clan,” Chu Feng mocked.</p>
 <p>“Impudent! You are truly courting death!!!” Seeing that Chu Feng actually dared to publicly insult him, Hu Xuanyi was immediately enraged. He did not bother with superfluous words anymore. Like a phantom, he flew toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>He did not utilize any martial skill. Rather, he swung his fists back and forth, shooting out successive punches. The blurs from his punches crisscrossed with one another. They were so numerous and densely packed that they looked like a torrential rain as they rushed to bombard Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Zzzz!!!”</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when Hu Xuanyi’s attack was about to reach Chu Feng, lightning flashed in Chu Feng’s eyes. Immediately, magnificent wings of lightning extended from his back, and a domineering armor of lightning covered his body.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s cultivation increased by two successive levels. From rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, he was now a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Chu Feng also possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Thus, all aspects of Chu Feng’s strength were on par with Hu Xuanyi.</p>
 <p>Thus, regardless of how powerful Hu Xuanyi’s attack might be, Chu Feng managed to easily dodge all of them.</p>
 <p>“This guy, he’s actually also a Heavenly Bloodline possessor?!!!”</p>
 <p>“But, didn’t he declare that he was from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm? How could there be someone with a Heavenly Bloodline from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm?!!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng had unleashed the special abilities of those who possessed Heavenly Bloodlines, the crowd and even the guardian clan’s elders had a change in their expressions as they looked to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, they grew even more certain that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary origin, that he was most definitely no ordinary member of the younger generation.</p>
 <p>“No wonder you were so confident. Turns out you’re actually a possessor of Heavenly Bloodline. However, even if that is the case, you will still undoubtedly be killed today!”</p>
 <p>That said, Hu Xuanyi was determined to kill Chu Feng. Even though he knew that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary origin, he did not feel the slightest hesitation. Instead, his attacks grew more powerful. He was determined to prove himself. He wanted to defeat Chu Feng using only his martial arts.</p>
 <p>“Undoubtedly be killed? You wish to kill me with merely your fancy but impractical skills?” Chu Feng laughed.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?!” Hu Xuanyi’s expression changed enormously. He simply did not dare to believe what he had heard.</p>
 <p>The reason why he dared to declare that he would defeat Chu Feng using only his martial arts after discovering that Chu Feng possessed strength no inferior to his own was because he was extremely confident.</p>
 <p>He was confident in his battle ability.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because his martial arts were the thing that he was most proficient in. No one in the guardian clan that was from the same generation as him was able to contend against him in terms of martial arts. As such, his martial arts were his strong suit, his pride.</p>
 <p>Yet, at that moment, the thing that he was most proud of, his martial arts that were seen as godly by others, was actually called ‘fancy but impractical skills’. He simply did not dare to believe his ears.</p>
 <p>Insult. This was an insult that he could not tolerate.</p>
 <p>“I said, your martial arts are… fancy… but… impractical… skills,” Chu Feng repeated himself one word at a time.</p>
 <p>“You are truly courting death!” Being insulted by Chu Feng like that, Hu Xuanyi grew even more furious. His punches and kicks grew faster and faster. Merely his punching and kicking had already brought forth energy ripples. The strong winds from his attacks caused the bystanders to be knocked frantically rolling and crawling. Those that were unfortunate enough to be struck by the winds were seriously injured.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the bystanders had no choice but to distance themselves from the battle. They were deeply afraid that they would be implicated.</p>
 <p>As for Hu Xuanyi, he grew fiercer and fiercer. He had completely unleashed all of his abilities. However… he had yet to connect with any of his punches or kicks.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Chu Feng did not fight back. Instead, he was merely dodging the bombardment of attacks.</p>
 <p>“This guy, why is he not fighting back?” Seeing that Chu Feng was dodging and not fighting back the entire time, the elders from the guardian clan became puzzled.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an elder from the guardian clan made an analysis in a deadpan earnest manner. “I got it! I finally understand why that brat is able to dodge Elder Xuanyi’s ferocious attacks.”</p>
 <p>“He must have grasped some sort of special method that allows him to dodge Elder Xuanyi’s close-range attacks.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, that special method of his possesses a major flaw. That is, he can only dodge, and not fight back.”</p>
 <p>“That sounds very reasonable. Perhaps that might be it,” Once that theory was presented, the elders of the guardian clan immediately voiced their agreement.</p>
 <p>“That guy clearly does not possess any true abilities. Rather, he is relying on some sort of special method to dodge Elder Xuanyi’s attacks. However, he actually still dares to insult Elder Xuanyi. He is truly despicable and shameless!”</p>
 <p>Once they all agreed to the proposed theory of Chu Feng relying on some special method and not his own abilities to dodge Hu Xuanyi’s attacks, they immediately started to look down on and even insult Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly attacked.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s fist was extremely fast. Like a flash of light, it shot forth. Before Hu Xuanyi could react, Chu Feng’s fist had landed on his chest.</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~”</p>
 <p>The fist struck. Immediately, Hu Xuanyi was knocked flying like an arrow that was shot out from a bow. He had been struck flying by Chu Feng’s fist.</p>
 <p>As he flew, he crashed through many giant trees and shattered many small hills. The might of that fist strike was simply astonishing.</p>
 <p>However, it remained that Hu Xuanyi was a peak Half Martial Ancestor-level expert. Thus, when he managed to land on the ground, only blood flowed from the corners of his mouth; he was not seriously injured.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, the surrounding crowd all had nervous expressions. They were extremely frightened by that scene.</p>
 <p>At that moment, they finally realized that Chu Feng had not used any special methods. Rather, he was overwhelmingly powerful. He would either not attack, or when he did, he would definitely injure that Hu Xuanyi.</p>
 <p>“Now do you admit to the fact that your martial arts are merely fancy but impractical skills?” Chu Feng said to Hu Xuanyi mockingly.</p>
 <p>“You are courting death!!!” As Hu Xuanyi snarled, he revealed a sword. It was an Incomplete Ancestral Armament.</p>
 <p>Right after he unleashed his Incomplete Ancestral Armament, he slashed at the space before him. Immediately, a slash flickering with golden light and reaching a hundred meters in either direction shot forth. It sliced through space and flew toward Chu Feng to cut him down.</p>
 <p>This was not an ordinary attack. Rather, it was a Taboo Martial Skill, an extremely mighty attack.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, this attack was filled with killing intent!!!</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, faced with Hu Xuanyi’s ferocious attack, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. With a flip of his wrist, he took out the Magma Emperor Sword and sliced at the space before him.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>A wild blazing slash shot forth. That blazing slash basked all of heaven and earth in a fiery light. It was as if that place had turned into an infernal realm of flames.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>The two slashes collided with one another and let out berserk energy ripples.</p>
 <p>In the end, Chu Feng had managed to rely on that slash to easily diffuse Hu Xuanyi’s slash.</p>
 <p>“This guy, how could he be so powerful?!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the elders from the guardian clan were all so extremely frightened by Chu Feng that their complexions turned green. Involuntarily, they started to fall back from the battlefield.</p>
 <p>Hu Xuanyi was the strongest among them. Yet, Hu Xuanyi’s powerful slash attack was easily canceled out by Chu Feng. As such, it clearly revealed how powerful Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>When even Hu Xuanyi was no match for Chu Feng, they knew that they would definitely not be a match for Chu Feng either.</p>
 <p>“If that’s all the ability that you possess, then I’m afraid you will not be able to stop me today,” Chu Feng said to the guardian clan’s elders.</p>
