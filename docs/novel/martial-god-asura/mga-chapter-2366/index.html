 <p><strong> Chapter 2366 - Trap</strong></p>
 <p>“W-wife, w-what are y-you doing?”</p>
 <p>“I-Isn’t my b-brother j-just suggesting t-this out of kind intentions? A-as the saying goes, s-safety is t-the number one priority. W-we wouldn’t be w-wasting a lot of spirit power, nor w-would we be wasting a l-lot of time,” Seeing that the atmosphere was amiss, Wang Qiang hurriedly spoke to diffuse the situation.</p>
 <p>“You shut up,” Zhao Hong was even more displeased at Wang Qiang speaking out for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Zhao Hong, since you distrust me like this, it would appear that you do not consider me your friend,” However, faced with the increasingly more malevolent Zhao Hong, Chu Feng smiled and said, “However, I, Chu Feng, consider you as my friend. I do not want something bad to happen to you.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I hope that you will trust me this once. If I am really mistaken and end up wasting our time, you can do whatever you wish to do to me.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you…” At that moment, Zhao Hong’s emotional expression grew much calmer. She was slightly embarrassed.</p>
 <p>She was clearly acting very aggressive, and even seemed to become hostile toward Chu Feng, but Chu Feng still faced her with a smiling face without being angered in the slightest. Instead, in a kind manner, he tried to persuade her. This caused Zhao Hong to feel very apologetic.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng was an individual that was afraid of the strong and bullied the weak, she would be fine with it.</p>
 <p>However, although Zhao Hong had not known Chu Feng for a long time, she knew how Chu Feng treated his enemies.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was not an individual who was afraid of the strong and bullied the weak. On the contrary, he was a fearless man.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s current reaction made Zhao Hong realize even more that Chu Feng truly considered her to be his friend, and was concerned for her well-being. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to be this courteous toward her.</p>
 <p>“Okay then, we’ll do as you say,” In the end, Zhao Hong compromised. Furthermore, after she finished saying those words, Zhao Hong was the first to begin setting up that spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Y-you’re the m-most r-resourceful a-after all,” At that moment, Wang Qiang’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ear.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled lightly and replied, “It’s merely sincerity.”</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang also joined Zhao Hong and began to set up the spirit formation together.</p>
 <p>With the three of them joining hands, their speed was extremely fast. Even though it was clearly a grand formation that was very difficult to set up, the three of them managed to finish more than half of the spirit formation in merely four hours.</p>
 <p>It was as Zhao Hong had anticipated, the three of them would be able to finish setting up the spirit formation in six hours’ time.</p>
 <p>“Master, this is bad!!!”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhao Hong’s two world spirits that were guarding this place suddenly revealed serious expressions.</p>
 <p>“They’ve actually chased us?” At that moment, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong hurriedly stopped setting up their spirit formations.</p>
 <p>They turned around and discovered that two figures were flying toward them. Those two people were none other than the two Kong Heavenly Clansmen that they confronted earlier.</p>
 <p>That rank one Martial Ancestor Kong Cheng.</p>
 <p>And that rank six Half Martial Ancestor Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong did not dare to be careless. After all, they were people from the Kong Heavenly Clan. Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were afraid that those two had called over the Kong Heavenly Clan’s experts.</p>
 <p>Soon, Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng appeared before Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong’s line of sight. However, apart from the two of them, there was no one else.</p>
 <p>“I’ve finally found you two,” That Kong Zheng gnashed his teeth angrily as he stared at Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. It was as if he possessed an enormous hatred against them.</p>
 <p>However, Kong Cheng grabbed Kong Zheng and pulled him behind. Then, he said to Zhao Hong, “I am unreconciled with the battle earlier. Are you willing to fight me again honorably?”</p>
 <p>“In that case, only the two of you came?” Zhao Hong asked in an astonished manner.</p>
 <p>“Is there even a need to request our Kong Heavenly Clan’s senior’s assistance against you? My big brother Kong Cheng alone will suffice,” Kong Zheng said.</p>
 <p>“Kong Zheng, stop talking!” Right after Kong Zheng finished saying those words, Kong Cheng shouted at him sternly. Then, he said, “This matter is unrelated to him. Are you willing to fight me again?”</p>
 <p>“Since you are this bold and reckless, I will satisfy you. Go, properly teach this egotistical fellow a lesson.”</p>
 <p>Once Zhao Hong said those words, her two Fairy World Spirits once again unleashed their bloodline power. As golden light flickered, their auras increased enormously.</p>
 <p>As for Kong Cheng, he had already activated his Thunder Armor, Thunder Wings and Lightning Mark before arriving.</p>
 <p>It could be seen that, as he had already fought against Zhao Hong’s two world spirits before, he no longer possessed the air of arrogance from earlier, and did not dare to be careless against them. As such, he had unleashed his strongest abilities from the get-go.</p>
 <p>Kong Cheng was afraid that the battle would implicate Kong Zheng. Thus, he first had Kong Zheng move far away from him before unleashing his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and flying toward the two world spirits to confront them.</p>
 <p>“Guu, guu, guu~~~”</p>
 <p>“Luu, luu, luu~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, the pond water in the area with a strong gravitational force started to surge.</p>
 <p>Most shockingly, multi-colored rays of light shot out from the surging black pond water.</p>
 <p>At the same time, an aura that relaxed one’s mind and jolted one’s spirit was subsequently emitted from the pond.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Kong Cheng, there’s treasure there! It is very possible that it’s the treasure Zhao Yu spoke of!” At that moment, that Kong Zheng’s eyes started to shine. He was incomparably excited, and unable to take his eyes away that strange and abnormal region of water.</p>
 <p>“We shall fight this battle later,” In response, Kong Cheng stopped his attacks and rushed directly into the pond water.</p>
 <p>The two world spirits followed after him and also dived into the pond water.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! That fellow is simply not planning to spar at all. He has come here for the sake of seizing the treasures.”</p>
 <p>“He a-actually w-wanted to s-seize it from us, a-as if!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, both Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang revealed angry expressions. They both planned to rush into the pond water.</p>
 <p>“Wait!” However, Chu Feng suddenly stopped them.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what are you doing?” Zhao Hong asked in a very displeased manner. After all, it was concerning a treasure here.</p>
 <p>“I feel that something is amiss. Careful, there may be a trap,” Chu Feng urged.</p>
 <p>“Trap? Where would the trap be? If there is a trap, how could that Kong Heavenly Clan’s fellow enter the water safely? How could my world spirits be able to enter the water?” Zhao Hong asked loudly.</p>
 <p>“It might be bait,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“No, you’re wrong. You are completely mistaken. I am connected with my world spirits. They are completely safe in there. There are simply no dangers at all,” After Zhao Hong finished saying those words, she tossed away Chu Feng’s hand that was holding her back and dove into the water.</p>
 <p>“B-brother, we’ve got to s-seize the t-treasure first.”</p>
 <p>Wang Qiang grinned at Chu Feng and then also dove into the water after Zhao Hong. It was not that he did not trust Chu Feng. Merely, compared to caring about his safety, he was more interested in the treasure. The reason for that was because the aura emitted by that treasure was truly no small matter.</p>
 <p>“......” Seeing that the two of them did not listen to his advice and entered the water, Chu Feng revealed a very complicated expression. However, what filled his eyes was mostly worry.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, only you and I are left. I am interested in knowing how strong you are,” Right at that moment, that Kong Zheng’s voice suddenly sounded.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng turned around, and discovered that Kong Zheng was currently stretching his muscles and bones with a very eager appearance of fighting against Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Kong Zheng’s eyes were filled with confidence. After all, Chu Feng was a rank five Half Martial Ancestor, whereas he was a rank six Half Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, they were both possessors of Heavenly Bloodlines. Thus, they had grasped the same sorts of abilities.</p>
 <p>As such, Kong Zheng felt that Chu Feng would absolutely not be a match for him. He felt that he would be able to defeat this newly-emerged genius in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>To Kong Zheng, this was a rare opportunity to become famous.</p>
 <p>“If you want to spar, I can spar with you sometime later. However, right now, I do not have time to waste on you,” Chu Feng cast a side eye at Kong Zheng. Then, he turned his gaze to the region below.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng deeply wished that his Heaven’s Eyes were wrong. He deeply wished that that region was safe. The reason for that was because he did not want anything to happen to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>“What arrogance,” Upon hearing Chu Feng’s response filled with contempt, Kong Zheng felt that he was being insulted. Thus, he revealed a furious expression and planned to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Wuuahhh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, in the pond water that was dazzling with golden radiance, a bitter scream was suddenly heard.</p>
 <p>“What is going on?” At that moment, Kong Zheng’s expression changed enormously. The reason for that was because the scream not only contained Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang’s voices, there was also Kong Cheng’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Crap!” At that moment, Chu Feng started to frown deeply. It was as he had anticipated, there was indeed a trap present.</p>
