 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1775 - Golden Leaf World Spirit Flower</strong></p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>After hearing the conversation between Yan Xie and Chu Feng, Chili Pepper and the others started to feel uneasy, and showed apologetic expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>Even though their perceptive abilities were not as sharp as Yan Xie’s, after they heard the dialogue between Yan Xie and Chu Feng, the three of them also managed to indirectly guess how powerful the five rays of oppressive might crushing down onto them from above were.</p>
 <p>They knew that they had caused an enormous inconvenience for Chu Feng. Yet, Chu Feng did not mention the difficult situation he had been placed in, and instead decided to shoulder it all himself so that they would not feel any burden.</p>
 <p>At this moment, they were all silent. However, in their hearts, they remembered all that Chu Feng had done for them...</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng was able to resist the five rays of oppressive might, he did not dare to take it easy. The reason for that was because he did not wish to be eliminated, he did not wish to have come here for nothing.</p>
 <p>Thus, there was only one thing in Chu Feng’s mind right now. That was, to grit his teeth and then use his strongest power to rapidly crash through this trial.</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was about to walk out from this location, he suddenly discovered a forked path ahead.</p>
 <p>“Really! To do this sort of cheap trick at such a time?” Chu Feng laughed lightly. This forked path was too obvious. Those with good eyesight could tell with a single glance that the left pathway was the correct one, whereas the one on the right was fake.</p>
 <p>Even though he knew that the pathway to the left was real and could bring one to the center of the fort, however, at the time he arrived at the fork in the path, Chu Feng couldn't help himself and took a glance at the pathway to the right.</p>
 <p>On the way there, Chu Feng had discovered that the person who had set up all these hurdles was extremely intelligent. Many of the hurdles were set up with great ingenuity, and contained hidden profoundness.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this moment, at this most important hurdle, such a simple multiple-choice question actually appeared. This was evidently not reasonable.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that there might be a hidden implication contained in this. Thus, he wished to take a look at exactly what sort of path that fake path to the right was.</p>
 <p>“That is?!”</p>
 <p>“I’m not seeing things, right?”</p>
 <p>“Is this for real?”</p>
 <p>Upon checking out the right path, Chu Feng’s eyes immediately shone, and he revealed an expression of shock. Immediately afterward, his shocked expression turned to one of immense joy. He exclaimed, “It’s real! Truly, the heavens are helping me!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng acting like this, Yan Xie and the others also turned their gazes over.</p>
 <p>It was only then did they discovered that at the end of that path was a large tree. Underneath that tree was a bed of golden flowers.</p>
 <p>Golden branches, golden leaves, golden flowers. Furthermore, the branches and leaves resembled little people.</p>
 <p>They were so vivid and lifelike that should one look at them from afar, they would look like people made of gold that flickered with gorgeous dazzling light.</p>
 <p>“What is that?” Chili Pepper and the others’ eyes all shrunk. Although they did not recognize the flowers, they were able to tell with a single glance that the flowers should be treasures.</p>
 <p>“Those are a kind of special flower called the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flower,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Golden Leaf World Spirit Flower?” Chili Pepper and the others were still confused.</p>
 <p>“Essentially, they are extremely beneficial to me,” As Chu Feng spoke, he began to walk toward the flower bed.</p>
 <p>The path was very deep. It took Chu Feng a lot of time to reach the end of the path. What he was doing was actually very risky. In wasting this much time, it was very possible that he would to fail to obtain one of the twenty fastest spots to enter the center of the fort.</p>
 <p>However, even though this was the case, Chu Feng felt that he still had to obtain those Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers.</p>
 <p>It was recorded in the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram that the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers were extremely beneficial to world spirits. They possessed the same sort of power as a martial cultivator’s source energy. By using them, world spirits could greatly increase their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew very well that as long as he obtained those Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers, he would not only be able to wake the sleeping Eggy up, he might even be able to help her increase her cultivation.</p>
 <p>Even though he was currently in a race against time for those twenty available spots, when compared to Eggy, how could missing the opportunity to compete possibly be able to compare to her?</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Feng knew the best how much Eggy had done for him.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, they’re the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers,” Finally, Chu Feng reached the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers.</p>
 <p>However, he did not immediately extend his hand to snatch them. Instead, he set up a small world spirit formation, then began to cautiously draw the flowers into it.</p>
 <p>Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers were very special. They possessed intelligence. If one were to use one’s hand to snatch them, they would disappear. Even though Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, he was still incapable of snatching them with his hands, and would thus miss this opportunity before him.</p>
 <p>Thus, at this time, Chu Feng had to be extremely careful. In fact, he did not even dare to lose his concentration. It was only when all of the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers had entered his spirit formation, and when he sealed off that spirit formation, that Chu Feng finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng turned around and prepared to walk toward the exit of this pathway. In his hand was the spirit formation, and his eyes were focused on the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers within it. On his face was an unconcealable smile.</p>
 <p>He knew that, having obtained these Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers, he would definitely be able to wake Eggy.</p>
 <p>“Although those flowers are quite the treasure, they seem to not have much usage for us martial cultivators,” Yan Xie said as he looked at the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers in Chu Feng’s spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, their value can only be reflected on world spiritists. However, they are priceless treasures. If a martial cultivator were to obtain them, they could exchange them for endless riches from world spiritists.”</p>
 <p>“I reckon that with this bed of Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers, if you were to place them before a world spiritist that knew of their value, they would be willing to hand over five Incomplete Imperial Armaments for them without the slightest bit of hesitation,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“They’re this precious?” Hearing those words, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish all opened their eyes wide with shock. They began to carefully inspect the Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers. It was as if they would feel enormous regret should they miss the opportunity to see these Golden Leaf World Spirit Flowers.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yan Xie said no more. Instead, he only smiled lightly. He believed in what Chu Feng had said because he believed in Chu Feng’s eyesight.</p>
 <p>It was as Chu Feng had guessed. After they walked out from that pathway and entered the other pathway, they arrived at the central region of the fort.</p>
 <p>At this moment, what appeared before them was a vast open site. This open site was formed with special materials imbued with world spirit power. Likely, anyone beneath Martial Emperor would not be able to destroy this place.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng and the others guessed that this vast, field-like open site should be the place where the Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly would be held.</p>
 <p>On the outside of the open site were twenty peaks. On top of each peak was an exquisite pagoda.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, before them was a stele. There was a special brush placed below the stele. Beside the brush was a special piece of paper.</p>
 <p>Everything was explained on the stele...</p>
 <p>Those who arrived would leave their name on the piece of paper and then choose a pagoda to rest in. Each person was allowed to choose one pagoda. After reaching their pagoda, one must illuminate the lanterns in the pagoda so that the people who arrive afterward will be able to choose other pagodas.</p>
 <p>After reading those words, Chili Pepper and the others immediately turned to look at the twenty pagodas. They discovered that none of the twenty towers had been lighted. Immediately, they were overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’re truly amazing. You brought us burdens with you and arrived here. Yet, you’re actually the first to arrive,” Chili Pepper and the others were overjoyed. They felt that even though they had dragged Chu Feng down, they had, at the very least, not harmed him by making him lose out on his chance to compete.</p>
 <p>“Come, write your names,” Chu Feng had already written his name onto the paper. Then, he handed the brush to Yan Xie.</p>
 <p>After Yan Xie received the brush from Chu Feng, he also wrote on the paper. However, he did not write his own name. Instead, he wrote ‘Flame Emperor’s successor’ on the paper.</p>
 <p>After that, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish also wrote their names on the paper. However, like Yan Xie, they also did not write their own names. Instead, they wrote their nick names onto the paper.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Chu Feng, am I also allowed to choose my own pagoda?” Little Radish asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“Haha, this is truly great,” Hearing those words, Little Radish became exceptionally excited. Chili Pepper and Big Radish also revealed smiles of excitement.</p>
 <p>The twenty pagodas should have belonged to the twenty peak geniuses. Yet, they actually possessed the opportunity to monopolize one of the twenty pagodas each. Naturally, they would be extremely happy.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when Chili Pepper and the others were overjoyed, a distant pagoda suddenly blossomed with dazzling light.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, Chili Pepper and the others were immediately stupefied. The joyous expression on their faces instantly disappeared.</p>
 <p>At this moment, even Chu Feng narrowed his eyes and revealed a surprised expression.</p>
 <p>Evidently, they were not the first ones to arrive here.</p>
