 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1256 - Nangong Longjian</strong></p>
 <p>After she blocked that management elder’s incoming attack, Bai Suyan’s expression turned ugly. She cast an angry look at that Punishment Department’s management elder and coldly asked, “You dare to attack me? Do you even know who I am?”</p>
 <p>“I could not care less as to who you are. For you to dare to attack our Cyanwood Forest’s disciples, you’ve already committed a capital offense.”</p>
 <p>That Punishment Department’s management elder was unwilling to drop the subject. With a movement of his body, he disappeared. By the time he reappeared, he was already behind Bai Suyan. Furthermore, with an extremely destructive might, he swatted his hand toward Bai Suyan’s back.</p>
 <p>However, when faced with this ruthless and powerful attack from the back, Bai Suyan did not move at all. Not only did she not turn to dodge the attack, she did not even bother to turn her head back. Instead, she said, “To dare attack Nangong Longjian’s woman, from the way I see it, the person who has committed a capital offense is you.”</p>
 <p>To everyone’s surprise, those sudden words actually caused that Punishment Department’s management elder to stay his hand. Furthermore, his expression changed greatly. In the end, he lowered his palm and did not continue to strike down.</p>
 <p>“You know Nangong Longjian?” The Punishment Department’s elder asked in a shocked manner.</p>
 <p>“Not only do I know him, I can even clearly tell you that Ruochen is Nangong Longjian’s daughter.”</p>
 <p>“You should know now how enormous of a calamity you all have stirred up, no?”</p>
 <p>“I do not wish to inform Longjian of this matter yet. Thus, it would be fine for me to handle it. Go and call that Qin Lingyun over right now and have him publicly apologize to my daughter. If you are to do that, I’ll consider it as if nothing had happened.”</p>
 <p>“Else, if Longjian were to come here, you should know what the consequences would be,” Bai Suyan coldly said.</p>
 <p>At this moment, that Punishment Department management elder’s expression was extremely grave. Fear and shock filled his flickering eyes. At the same time, he was also extremely skeptical.</p>
 <p>“You say you’re Nangong Longjian’s wife? What a joke! How could Nangong Longjian’s wife become the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster’s wife?”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you’re planning to tell me that the Ascension Sect’s sectmaster is actually Nangong Longjian? Or could it be that Nangong Longjian is an enormous cuckold?” That Punishment Department’s management elder mocked.</p>
 <p>“Hah, this is my own family matter, there is no need for you to bother with it. I will only ask you one thing, are you going to hand over that Qin Lingyun or not?” Bai Suyan said.</p>
 <p>“You want to make Lingyun apologize? In your dreams!” That Punishment Department’s management elder firmly refused.</p>
 <p>“Very well, in that case, you can wait for Nangong Longjian to come and find you all to settle the debt.” After Bai Suyan finished saying these words, she looked to Bai Ruochen and Chu Feng, “Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying hurriedly followed behind Bai Suyan.</p>
 <p>Bai Suyan was about to bring the three of them and leave. However, right at this moment, the elders of the Cyanwood Mountain surrounded them.</p>
 <p>“What, could it be that you’re trying to detain me?” Seeing this, Bai Suyan squinted her eyes and a faint killing intent emerged from them.</p>
 <p>“Our Cyanwood Mountain is not a place where you can come and go as you please,” said the Cyanwood Mountain’s elders in unison.</p>
 <p>Bai Suyan was daring enough to beat up their Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples before their very eyes. This made them feel that they had been insulted. Thus, they would naturally not let Bai Suyan get away that easily.</p>
 <p>“Let her go,” However, to their surprise, that Punishment Department’s management elder suddenly spoke to let them go.</p>
 <p>After hearing what that management elder said, even though the other elders were very puzzled, they still ended up moving aside and making way for Bai Suyan.</p>
 <p>“Humph.” Bai Suyan did not bother with superfluous words. With a cold snort, she led Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying and left.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Mission Plaza became silent. The majority of the people had their gazes fixed on the direction in which Bai Suyan had left. They were thinking about who exactly was this Nangong Longjian that she had spoke of.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only the disciples present that did not know about Nangong Longjian, even many of the elders did not know who he was. Only that Punishment Department’s management elder knew.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, after Bai Suyan left, that management elder disregarded the matter concerning the dragon grade mission and hurried back to the Punishment Department to report what had happened to Crazed Killer Tuoba.</p>
 <p>“Nangong Longjian? Are you certain that she said Nangong Longjian?” Crazed Killer Tuoba, the head of the Punishment Department, could be said to be the person with the highest standing in the Cyanwood Mountain right now. Yet, after he heard Nangong Longjian, he too displayed an extremely shocked and strange expression.</p>
 <p>“Absolutely certain,” the management elder replied with certainty.</p>
 <p>“This…” After hearing those words, Crazed Killer Tuoba’s expression turned stern, and his gaze was flickering nonstop.</p>
 <p>He involuntarily began to recall something that happened in the past.</p>
 <p>That year, both Crazed Killer Tuoba and this management elder were very young, high-spirited and not the grey-haired old men that they now were.</p>
 <p>That year, the two of them were not elders of the Cyanwood Mountain. Instead, they were the most outstanding geniuses on the Cyanwood Succession List.</p>
 <p>That year, Dugu Xingfeng was not yet the Cyanwood Mountain’s headmaster. Instead, he was the head of the Punishment Department.</p>
 <p>That year, a grand event occurred in the Holy Land of Martialism. A monstrous clan that had hidden themselves for years had come back to the world and were massacring the disciples of the Nine Powers.</p>
 <p>In order to eradicate this monstrous clan, the Nine Powers joined hands and unleashed an assault on that monstrous clan’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>At that time, the person leading the group from the Cyanwood Mountain was Dugu Xingfeng. Not only did he lead the many elders of the Punishment Department to battle, he also, for the purpose of allowing talented individuals that he fancied to be able to gain knowledge and experience, brought Crazed Killer Tuoba, Half Martial Emperor White Ape and other disciples with him.</p>
 <p>At that time, the people from the Nine Powers gathered secretly. Although the troops that they sent could not be considered to be the strongest from their respective powers, when those troops gathered, their battle strength was no small matter.</p>
 <p>However, the people from the Nine Powers had still underestimated that monstrous clan. At the moment when they grandiosely entered the headquarters of that monstrous clan, preparing to massacre them, they were shocked to discover that they had actually entered a slaughterhouse.</p>
 <p>Not only did their opponent possess countless monstrous beasts, they were also fully prepared and possessed the advantage of the location. The troops dispatched from the Nine Powers were simply no match for them.</p>
 <p>As they watched the Cyanwood Mountain’s management elders die one after another, as they watched the Half Martial Emperors being turned into indistinct flesh, Crazed Killer Tuoba and the others, who were incapable of even participating in the battle and could only hide behind Dugu Xingfeng, were all scared witless.</p>
 <p>They were still so young. They were still unable to exhibit their great potential. Not a single one of them wanted to die like that. However, there was nothing they could do, as it was not something that they could prevent.</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when everyone from the Nine Powers could potentially lose their lives, a man appeared.</p>
 <p>It was a middle-aged man...</p>
 <p>He had a head of long black, ink-like hair that grew past his waist.</p>
 <p>He held a golden sword that was nine feet long, which had an enormous dragon carved on it.</p>
 <p>He arrived by walking in the air and calmly entered the battlefield amongst the frantic and malevolent army of monstrous beasts.</p>
 <p>His frail figure, when compared to the monstrous beasts that had revealed their true form, simply appeared like an ant that had walked into a group of elephants. It was truly pathetic.</p>
 <p>Yet, with only himself and using only his sword, he exterminated all those monstrous beasts of that monstrous clan that were wreaking havoc.</p>
 <p>Crazed Killer Tuoba clearly remembered how powerful that man was. Even the strongest among that monstrous clan, the monstrous beast king, was beheaded by him with a single strike.</p>
 <p>More than that, Crazed Killer Tuoba would never forget that man’s name -- Nangong Longjian.</p>
