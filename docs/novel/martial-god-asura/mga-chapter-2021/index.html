 <p><strong> Chapter 2021 - Wonderstone Dao Ground</strong></p>
 <p>“It is truly our Cyanwood Mountain’s blessing to have Chu Feng as our disciple,” At that moment, Dugu Xingfeng was also extremely excited. At the same time, he was gasping with admiration.</p>
 <p>Back then, when Chu Feng had first entered their Cyanwood Mountain, he had been so small and weak. Not to mention the huge monsters outside of the Cyanwood Mountain, even the many elders within the Cyanwood Mountain would have easily been able to kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that time, even though he had been attracted by Chu Feng’s talent, he did not imagine that Chu Feng would grow up this much and become this powerful in a period of a few short years.</p>
 <p>“Mn?” Suddenly, Dugu Xingfeng’s expression changed. As the grand spirit formation had already been set up, and even the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others were here, why was Chu Feng nowhere to be seen?</p>
 <p>Puzzled, Dugu Xingfeng asked the crowd, “Milords, where’s Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng exhausted practically all of his spirit power in order to set up this spirit formation. His health is very weak right now. Likely, he will have to rest for some time in order to recover,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>When the Weaponry Refinement Immortal said those words, the Immeasurable Immortal and Zhang Ming revealed ashamed expressions.</p>
 <p>In terms of seniority, they were both Chu Feng’s seniors.</p>
 <p>In terms of qualifications, they had become famous thousands of years ago.</p>
 <p>Yet, they knew very well that they had completely relied on Chu Feng to set up that grand defensive spirit formation.</p>
 <p>Even with all of their contributions combined, it was still inferior to what Chu Feng had done for the spirit formation. It was all due to Chu Feng’s contributions that they had managed to successfully set up that grand spirit formation.</p>
 <p>That was why Chu Feng’s health became extremely weak, and his spirit power nearly completely exhausted after they finished setting up the grand formation.</p>
 <p>“May I go check on Chu Feng?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course. Little friend Chu Feng was also worried about you the entire time. If you had not returned, we would’ve really gone out to search for you,” Nangong Longjian said.</p>
 <p>“Milords, please,” Hearing those words, Dugu Xingfeng’s expression turned serious. He held tightly to the symbol he had procured and began to fly toward Chu Feng’s residence. He wanted to personally hand the symbol to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Nangong Longjian, Baili Xuankong and the others also followed after him. They were also worried about Chu Feng. However, more than that, as the five symbols were all gathered, they wanted to know exactly what the treasure hidden by the Five Elements Secret Skills was.</p>
 <p>Merely, when they arrived at Chu Feng’s palace, they were all shocked.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was chatting with the Snow-haired Immortal like a lively dragon, an animated tiger. How could he possibly appear like a person in extremely weak health?</p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, you’ve returned? I had thought about going to the Cursed Soil Sect to receive you,” Chu Feng was overjoyed to see Dugu Xingfeng.</p>
 <p>When he had found out that Dugu Xingfeng had yet to return, he had become very worried. After his health improved, he had planned to go find Dugu Xingfeng. Merely, he was stopped by the Snow-haired Immortal. He was just explaining to the Snow-haired Immortal that he was fine and could go to search for Dugu Xingfeng when Dugu Xingfeng arrived.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you… you’re fine now?” At that moment, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others all walked over. They were looking at Chu Feng like they were looking at a monster.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had finished setting up the grand defensive spirit formation two days ago. After that, he had directly fainted from nearly exhausting all of his spirit power.</p>
 <p>It was a major taboo for world spiritists to completely exhaust their spirit power, because they would not be able to recover in a short period of time, and it might even cause permanent damage that stopped the progress of their world spirit techniques. In the most serious cases, their spirit power might not be able to recover at all. Even if other world spiritists were to forcibly instill their spirit power into them, it would still be useless.</p>
 <p>However, what was this with Chu Feng? Not only was there no harm, he had even recovered so quickly and thoroughly?</p>
 <p>“Seniors, you don’t have to worry about me. I am fine now.”</p>
 <p>“If you don’t believe me, look at this,” Chu Feng said with a smile. Fearing that they would not believe him, Chu Feng began to unleash his own world spirit power.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Chu Feng’s fluent command over the abundant Dragon Mark Royal-level spirit power, the crowd all came to believe that Chu Feng had recovered.</p>
 <p>It was true that Chu Feng had exhausted his spirit power. If he were an ordinary person, he would have indeed needed a long time to recuperate.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng’s spirit power recovered extremely fast. Furthermore, with the recovery of his spirit power, Chu Feng’s health also recovered.</p>
 <p>“Demon-level character, truly a demon-level character,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal muttered. He mocked Chu Feng’s astonishing composition.</p>
 <p>That being said, everyone was smiling. They were all feeling happy for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In fact, even Chu Feng himself was very surprised by what had happened. This time around, he had truly exhausted his spirit power, and had not expected that he would be able to recover so fast.</p>
 <p>In other words, after what had happened, Chu Feng discovered that not only was his Inherited Bloodline powerful, his spirit power seemed to be even more powerful than his Inherited Bloodline.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, since you’re fine, then should we solve the mystery of the Five Elements Secret Skills?” The Immeasurable Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng,” In response, Dugu Xingfeng handed the symbol he held to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Following that, Baili Xuankong, Nangong Longjian and the Snow Blade Mad Demon also handed their respective symbols to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Very well,” After receiving the symbols, Chu Feng took out the symbol that he already had. Then, he began to form hand seals with one hand and spoke some incantations. The five symbols began to fuse with one another.</p>
 <p>After the five symbols fused completely with one another, they turned into a firefly-sized body of light.</p>
 <p>Although that body of light was very small, everyone could tell that it was amazing.</p>
 <p>Although the five symbols had disappeared, countless characters that the crowd were unable to understand were hovering within that body of light.</p>
 <p>The crowd present were all able to tell that the characters present in that body of light were characters from the Ancient Era.</p>
 <p>Each single character possessed a special meaning and extraordinary power.</p>
 <p>When looking at those characters, one would feel delighted in one’s heart. It was as if the more they looked at them and the more they understood, the more their cultivation would be able to make progress.</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when everyone was about to be fascinated by the characters, Chu Feng spoke another incantation. Then, he shouted lightly, “In!”</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>That body of light was beckoned by Chu Feng’s incantation. It turned into a ray of light that shot into the area between Chu Feng’s eyebrows.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd began to hold their breaths. They were extremely tense, and unable to take their eyes off Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>They knew that it was very possible that Chu Feng now knew about the secret of the treasure left behind by the Five Elements Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, how was it?” The Immeasurable Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s a success. Sure enough, Five Elements Old Ancestor did leave items behind,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What are they?” At this moment, the crowd asked in unison.</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure. But I’ll know once I reach the Wonderstone Dao Ground,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>[1. Dao Ground is literally the same word as the japanese ‘dojo.’ It is a place for enlightenment of the dao.]</p>
 <p>“Wonderstone Dao Ground?” The crowd were all startled upon hearing those words.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, do you all know where the Wonderstone Dao Ground is located?” Chu Feng asked. He did not know anything about the Wonderstone Dao Ground.</p>
 <p>“We do. Merely, that place has been abandoned for a very long time. Furthermore…” The Immeasurable Immortal did not finish his sentence.</p>
