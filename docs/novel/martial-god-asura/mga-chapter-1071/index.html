 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1071 - Mysterious Life Form</strong></p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng and the other twenty-four individuals had become the focus of the crowd and were even thought to be exceptionally talented.</p>
 <p>The difference between them and the Ancient Era’s Elves was still enormous. That was because of the six hundred people from the Ancient Era’s Elves that had entered into the Immortal Pond, not a single one had left the center region. All of them had managed to withstand the frightening pressure from the depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Era’s Elves are amazing. Not a single one of them have actually left that region of water.” Seeing this scene, there were people who appeared to have already anticipated it. However, for others like Wang Wei, they were extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>“It is said that the Ancient Era’s Elves were born from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds. While the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds might reject other species, how could they possibly reject these Ancient Era’s Elves who were their own offsprings?” Elder Gongsun explained.</p>
 <p>“Born from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds? Elder Gongsun, what exactly are the true forms of these Ancient Era’s Elves?” Asked Wang Wei and the others curiously.</p>
 <p>However, Elder Gongsun shook his head when faced with their questions. He said, “That has been a riddle the entire time. There are many theories as to what their true forms are. However, there is no one who could verify whether any of those theories are true.”</p>
 <p>“Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. Woosh.”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, the Ancient Era’s Elves flipped their bodies. Like carps, they displayed an elegant arc and entered into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. With extreme speed, they dove into the pitch-black depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>“Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. Woosh.”</p>
 <p>Following them, Yuan Qing, Qin Guang and the others also flipped over and dived into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>However, other than Yuan Qing and Qin Guang, not a single person was able to match up with the speed of the Ancient Era’s Elves. There were even people who immediately swam back into the water surface with strenuous expressions right after they dived in.</p>
 <p>In the end, of the twenty-five individuals who managed to withstand the pressure on the surface of the water, only twenty of them managed to successfully dive into the water. Slowly, they dove deeper into the water, but soon enough there were people who were unable to withstand the pressure within the water and rushed back into the surface. There were also people who, after diving a certain amount, stopped diving deeper into the water and began to train.</p>
 <p>That was because those people had reached their limits. Training in that place would give them a much better result than training on the surface of the water.</p>
 <p>At this moment, of the twenty individuals, there were only ten who were able to continue to dive deeper. As for Chu Feng, he was among these ten individuals.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s diving speed wasn’t fast, in fact, it was relatively slow. That was because he was able to sense that the pressure within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was indeed extraordinary. The deeper he dove, the greater the pressure became.</p>
 <p>Actually, this sort of pressure was nothing much to Chu Feng. He was fully able to speed up his diving. At the very least, he would be able to be faster than Yuan Qing, Qin Guang and even the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>The reason why he was diving so slow was because he was planning to preserve his physical strength. He planned to gradually allow his body to adapt to the change in pressure. Like that, he would be able to persist in the water for a longer time.</p>
 <p>He knew that this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was very deep and that it was still a long way till he would reach the bottom. It was simply not a task that he could try to accomplish quickly. In this sort of place, to gradually dive deeper was a better choice.</p>
 <p>As he continued to dive into the water, the people beside Chu Feng began to pull apart from him. They had become incapable of withstanding the pressure within the water. As for Chu Feng, he remained as relaxed as before.</p>
 <p>Right now, Chu Feng had already entered into the pitch-black area. Lifting his head, he was no longer able to see the slightest trace of light. This area could truly be said to be pitch-black. Moreover, frightening pressure filled the area. Even though Chu Feng was a cultivator, he was still unable to see anything here.</p>
 <p>Fortunately for Chu Feng, he was no ordinary cultivator. In addition to being a cultivator, he was also a World Spiritist. Moreover, Chu Feng was no ordinary World Spiritist, he was a World Spiritist who possessed the Heaven’s Eyes.</p>
 <p>Thus, when Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes, he was able to see clearly everything within five hundred meters range of his line of sight.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng discovered that the region of water that he was currently in ought to be the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. That was because only a small portion of region of water above where he currently was contained that sort of frightening pressure. Moreover, this pressure appeared like a tunnel and did not flow out at all.</p>
 <p>However, his surrounding several tens of thousands of meters were filled with that frightening pressure. It truly appeared to be dark and frightening.</p>
 <p>However, because Chu Feng had been diving downwards in a straight line the entire time, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was at a place not far from him. This assured him that he had not lost his way.</p>
 <p>“What’s that?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng’s eyes shined. He had actually discovered a special kind of life form within this region of water that did not even have weeds growing in it.</p>
 <p>That life form had merely the size of a firefly. However, it was completely transparent. Colorless and odorless, it did not even give off the slightest bit of aura. Had it not been for his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng would likely not have discovered this life form either.</p>
 <p>At this moment, that life form was floating past Chu Feng. Calm and unhurried, it did not put Chu Feng in its eyes at all.</p>
 <p>“Woosh.” Catching it off guard, Chu Feng suddenly extended his hand and directly caught that life form in his hand. To Chu Feng’s surprise, when he caught that life form in his hand, it turned into a body of energy and, from his palm, entered into his dantian.</p>
 <p>“Wow, this little guy actually contained such dense natural energy.” At this moment, even Chu Feng displayed expressions of shock. That was because that mysterious life form simply appeared as if it was composed from natural energies. The natural energy contained within that life form greatly surpassed the intensity of the natural energies that was flowing through this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>“Hey, there are definitely natural oddities in a bizarre place. With how mysterious this place is, it is not strange to have such kind of life form. Carefully search around, if you are able to find more of them, you might be able to break through to Martial King level.” At this moment, even Eggy who was silent for a very long time spoke out.</p>
 <p>“Although this life form contains a lot of natural energy, I am already a rank nine Martial Lord. The amount of resources I need in order to break through to Martial King level is truly too frightening. Even if there are more of these life forms, I would still need a frightening amount of them in order to break through.” Chu Feng shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Why are you thinking so much? Just capture as many of them as there are. Why did you come to this place? Isn’t it so that you could train? Or have you come here for the purpose of triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle? What use is there in triggering that useless thing? What sort of benefit would it bring about you?” Said Eggy in a vexed manner.</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes yes. I’ll do as you bid. Your subordinate would go and search for more right away.” Seeing Eggy flipping out on him, Chu Feng did not dare to act melancholy anymore. Instead, with a movement of his body, he began to search everywhere.</p>
 <p>To Chu Feng’s avail, he had searched in this region of water for close to an hour but only managed to find three such mysterious life forms. In helplessness, Chu Feng had no choice but to continue diving deeper in hope that there would be more such life forms in the deeper region of water.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng had anticipated, after he dived deeper into the water, the amount of mysterious life forms had truly increased. This gave Chu Feng a lot more confidence. If the amount of these mysterious life forms would increase in places with greater pressure, then perhaps there would be enough mysterious life forms in the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond to allow Chu Feng to reach Martial King level.</p>
 <p>“Wow, this seemed to the tempo of striking gold.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng’s eyes shined. He displayed an ecstatic expression. That was because before him was actually a flock of mysterious life forms. A rough estimation would be at least several hundreds of them.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Chu Feng rushed forward. He wanted to refine all of those mysterious life forms.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~~”</p>
 <p>To Chu Feng’s surprise, as if they had intelligence, those life forms, upon seeing Chu Feng approaching them, rapidly fled from him and fused together. In the end, they turned into a one meter long fish shaped life form. Like an arrow, the fish dived into the depths of the water. Its speed was so incredibly fast.</p>
