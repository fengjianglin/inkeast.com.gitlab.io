 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1177 - Too Late For Regrets</strong></p>
 <p>The scarlet flames dyed the sky blood-red. At the same time, the heat from the flames seemed to have burned everything in the sky.</p>
 <p>However, what was the most frightening were the fiery mountains that were even now descending from the sky.</p>
 <p>Each and every fireball contained might not inferior to Lei Yao’s Mortal Taboo: Heaven Splitting Axe.</p>
 <p>To have this many fiery mountains descending from the sky at once, without mentioning the destruction that they would cause, merely their might was enough to terrify people.</p>
 <p>“That martial skill is so powerful, could it be an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill? That Chu Feng actually grasped an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill?” As they looked at the fiery mountains that covered the sky, people cried out in surprise nonstop. That was because the might of Chu Feng’s Taboo Martial Skill was truly too powerful, greatly surpassing other Mortal Taboo Martial Skills. This led to the crowd to believe that what Chu Feng had used might be an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.</p>
 <p>However, the difficulty of gasping an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill was extremely high. Not to mention ordinary people, even geniuses would find it very difficult to learn an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, with very few among even those, actually managing to master one. If what Chu Feng displayed was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, then even if the crowd did not want to be shocked, they would have no choice but to be shocked.</p>
 <p>“No, this is not an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. However, it’s a peak Mortal Taboo Martial Skill, with might greatly surpassing that of other ordinary Mortal Taboo Martial Skills.”</p>
 <p>“Amazing. Although it’s not an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, it is indefinitely close to an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Such a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill would be extremely difficult to grasp, with difficulty not inferior to that of Earthen Taboo Martial Skills. This Chu Feng, he is actually able to use it in such a skilled manner. It must be said that this child is extremely amazing. At the very least, his talent in learning martial skills is extremely high, truly up to the standards of a demon-level character.”</p>
 <p>Compared to the disciples, the elders were more understanding of what was happening. At this moment, the elders that were unrelated to Chu Feng began to have a whole new level of respect for him, exclaiming their admiration nonstop.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that this is our Ascension Sect’s Mortal Taboo: Fire Meteor?”</p>
 <p>In fact, Chu Feng’s current display not only stunned everyone else, even Bai Ruochen, who was familiar with Chu Feng, was displaying an expression of surprise. Her two beautiful eyes were flickering nonstop.</p>
 <p>She was able to guess that what Chu Feng had used was most likely one of the several Mortal Taboo Martial Skills that he had trained in while at the Ascension Sect. However, never did Bai Ruochen imagine that this Mortal Taboo Martial Skill could display such powerful might in Chu Feng’s hands.</p>
 <p>Actually, what Chu Feng used was indeed the Mortal Taboo: Fire Meteor that he had learned in the Ascension Sect.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an explosion sounded from the sky. Like a shockwave, a violent energy ripple wreaked havoc through the skies.</p>
 <p>It turned out that it was the result of Lei Yao’s Mortal Taboo: Heaven Splitting Axe colliding with Chu Feng’s Mortal Taboo: Fire Meteor. Merely, Chu Feng had only used a single fiery meteor to cancel out Lei Yao’s Mortal Taboo: Heaven Splitting Axe, and his remaining fiery meteors continued to smash toward Lei Yao like a meteor shower.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think that I will lose to you with only this.”</p>
 <p>The defeat of his Mortal Taboo: Heaven Splitting Axe brought great unwillingness to Lei Yao. With a flip of his palm, Lei Yao took out his Royal Armament.</p>
 <p>It was a large and long blade. Its entire body was blue in color, appearing as if it were constructed from gems. This blade was so long that merely its handle was two meters long. As for the blade itself, it was three meters[1.pelicanv: this guy uses a 15 ft sword like he's sephiroth or something.] long. From a single glance, one could tell that it was a sharp weapon used for killing.</p>
 <p>In truth, this was exactly what it was. After this Royal Armament appeared, not only did Lei Yao’s aura increase, it even began to send out countless crescent light strikes one after another as it was being brandished by Lei Yao. Each and every one of those crescent light strikes was capable of slashing apart one of Chu Feng’s fire meteors. The might of this Royal Armament was truly good; it was most definitely a top quality Royal Armament.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lei Yao was moving among the countless fiery meteors like a nimble monkey. Following every single sword strike from him would be a slashed apart fiery meteor.</p>
 <p>Lei Yao did not sit and wait for death. Instead, he soared into the sky, and used the power of his Royal Armament to fight back against Chu Feng’s Mortal Taboo: Fire Meteor and charge toward Chu Feng himself.</p>
 <p>“Amazing. As expected of senior brother Lei Yao. He stopped using martial skills and instead brandished his Royal Armament as his weapon and his body as his shield to counterattack. Truly, this is what a real man is.”</p>
 <p>“Senior brother Lei Yao, go for it. Kill that Chu Feng just like that. Make him realize how powerful you are. Make him realize that no matter how powerful that martial skill he grasped is, it is nothing more than a martial skill. The fusion of one’s self and one’s weapon is what the peak of cultivation truly is.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Lei Yao counterattack, they knew he had not been demoralized by Chu Feng’s Mortal Taboo: Fire Meteor, and instead started to attack even more violently. Many disciples of the Orion Monastery started to cheer for Lei Yao.</p>
 <p>After hearing the cheers from the crowd, Lei Yao’s might doubled, and his confidence soared greatly. The more he fought back, the greater he became. Like a human-shaped beast holding a large blade in its hand, he sliced apart fiery meteor after fiery meteor. Finally, he arrived before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, today shall be the day of your death.” [2. He literally say today shall be the day of your death anniversary next year. Sounds super weird when translated.]</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Chu Feng, the killing intent in Lei Yao’s eyes surged forth. With a movement, Lei Yao disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already above Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Woosh.” Lei Yao’s two arms were abruptly waved downward. Carrying with it the whistling sound of wind, and a very frightening power, the large blade in his hand hacked down toward Chu Feng’s head. If this strike were to land, then Chu Feng would most definitely be chopped in two.</p>
 <p>However, as Lei Yao’s ruthless slash came hacking down at Chu Feng’s head, Chu Feng remained strangely calm. Suddenly, Chu Feng raised one hand. As he closed the hand that he had raised, a large pitch-black sword appeared above his head. It was the Demon Sealing Sword.</p>
 <p>“Clang~~~~”</p>
 <p>The large Royal Armament blade landed on the Demon Sealing Sword. The sound of metal colliding was immediately heard. As the sparks from the collision shone through their surroundings, layers upon layers of ripples emerged. The ripples were so powerful that even Lei Yao was forced back several meters.</p>
 <p>“How could this be? This sort of sensation?” After being forced back, Lei Yao’s expression changed greatly. When he turned his gaze to his Royal Armament, an unbelieving expression emerged in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Perhaps others might not be able to tell, but Lei Yao was able to clearly sense that his large Royal Armament blade had actually slightly trembled at the moment of collision with Chu Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword. It was not a trembling that had resulted from their collision, it was instead a trembling that originated from the blade itself. That sort of trembling was a signal of a state, the signal of fear.</p>
 <p>His top quality Royal Armament was actually being scared off by his opponent’s Royal Armament?!!!</p>
 <p>“Woosh.”</p>
 <p>However, right when Lei Yao was feeling this situation to be unbelievable, along with feeling an indescribable unease, a flash of lightning suddenly flickered past him. Countless lightning serpents of numerous different colors were spreading out toward him.</p>
 <p>At the moment when he managed to respond, he was shocked to discover that it was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng’s Thunder Armor was emitting numerous bolts of lightning and thunderous roars. The Thunder Wings on his back were swaying back and forth, causing him to appear even more demonic.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng’s hand that had caused Lei Yao’s Royal Armament to tremble in fear was already slashing toward him.</p>
 <p>However, at this very moment, what brought the most fright to Lei Yao was Chu Feng’s mouth; he actually had a smile on his face, a cruel smile, as if saying everything had gone exactly as planned.</p>
 <p>In the past, Lei Yao had been unable to make sense of this smile, and had even ridiculed Chu Feng for being stupid and ignorant for smiling when a great calamity was about to befall him.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, he finally understood that smile. However, it was already too late for regrets.</p>
 <p>Lei Yao’s expression was ashen like dust. He blurted out, “Damn it!”</p>
